For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information about the possible letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- L – in the word AND now locked into position 4 (✓ from RAILY)

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y

So the pattern we have so far is: _ _ _ L _  (L is fixed at position 4)

We still need to place A and I somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, with:

Remaining untested vowels: O, U

We need two more unique letters to fill the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) while including A and I.

A good candidate structure would place the remaining letters in new positions, testing high-frequency unused consonants. Let's consider placing:
- A in position 1 (never tested there)
- I in position 2 (never tested there)
- This would leave positions 3 and 5 to fill with new consonants.

A word that fits: A _ I L _ with new consonants. ""C"" and ""N"" are common, unused consonants.

So ""CAINL"" is invalid (not a word), but ""FINAL"" fits:
F (new), I (position 2 - new), N (new), A (position 1 - new), L (position 4 - confirmed)
This uses all known letters in new positions and introduces two fresh, common consonants.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

S – not in the word (x)  
L – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
A – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
T – not in the word (x)  
E – not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: L and A
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Places them in different positions than they were in SLATE (L was 2nd, A was 3rd)
- Does not contain S, T, or E

Good candidates place L or A in other positions and include new common consonants to test. A solid second-guess word that satisfies all constraints is “PLANK”:

P – new consonant  
L – present, now in 2nd position (it was 2nd in SLATE, so this is still “wrong” position)  
A – present, now in 3rd position (it was 3rd in SLATE, so still “wrong” position)  
N – new consonant  
K – new consonant  

Actually, I want to move the known letters to new positions. Let me pick “PLAID”:

P – new  
L – in 1st position (was 2nd)  
A – in 2nd position (was 3rd)  
I – new vowel to test  
D – new consonant  

This keeps L and A while shifting their positions and brings in fresh letters P, I, D.

Summary so far:
Letters confirmed to be in the word (wrong position both times):
- L (was position 2 in SLATE and again position 2 in PLAID, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- A (was position 3 in SLATE and position 3 in PLAID, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- I (appeared for first time in PLAID at position 4, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, D

Consonants still untested that are common: R, N, C, G, B, M, K  
Vowels still untested that are common: O, U  

We need a word that
- Uses L, A, and I  
- Places them in new positions  
- Avoids all eliminated letters  

Let’s try to move all three known letters to fresh spots:
- We could put A in 1st position (never tested)  
- We could put L in 3rd position (never tested)  
- We could put I in 2nd position (never tested)  

Now we need two more letters from the safe pool. Common choices: R, N, C, K, etc.

Candidate word fitting these constraints: ""RAILY""
R – untested consonant, high frequency  
A – in 1st position (new)  
I – in 2nd position (new)  
L – in 3rd position (new)  
Y – untested letter (acts as vowel-like)  

""RAILY"" satisfies every rule and tests three new positions for the known letters plus two fresh letters.

Current confirmed information:

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- I is locked into position 2 (✓ from FINAL)  
- L is locked into position 4 (✓ from RAILY)  

Letters known to be IN the word but whose exact positions we still need to pin down:
- A (cannot be in position 2 or 4, and from FINAL it was not in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is: _ I _ L _
And A must be in position 1, 3, or 5, but position 5 was ruled out by FINAL (A(-) in position 5), so A must be in position 1 or 3.

We need three more unique letters for the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5). We already have A to place, plus two new consonants from the unused pool: possible choices are C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Let’s consider placing A in position 1:
A I _ L _

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5. Common, untested ones: C, G, K, M, etc.

Candidate: A I C L M (not a word), A I C L K (not a word), A I M L C (not a word)

Better to try placing A in position 3:
_ I A L _

Now positions 1 and 5 need two new consonants. Let’s pick C and K (common and untested).

This gives: C I A L K – valid word ""CIALK""? No, that's not correct.

Wait, ""C I A L K"" is not a valid word. Let's think of valid English words that fit _ I A L _ or A I _ L _.

Valid options:
- A I _ L _: ""AIGLE"" (not a common word), ""AILED"" (but D is out), ""AIMED"" (M, E, D out), ""AIRED"" (R, E, D out)
- _ I A L _: ""BIALY"" (Y out), ""DIALS"" (S, D out), ""GIALO"" (O possible, but not a word), ""HIALT"" (not a word), ""KIALA"" (not a word)

Actually, a valid English word that fits _ I A L _ is ""VIALS"", but S is out.

Another approach: list possible words with I in 2 and L in 4, containing A, and avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

Valid letters left: A, I, L, plus C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, etc.

Possible patterns:
- A I _ L _: need two more letters, but A I _ L _ would require A in 1, I in 2
- _ I _ L _: with A in 3, and two new consonants in 1 and 5

Looking at _ I A L _:
Need two consonants for 1 and 5. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Real words:
- B I A L _ : ""BIALY"" (Y out)
- C I A L _ : ""CIAL?"" No
- G I A L _ : ""GIAL?"" No
- H I A L _ : ""HIAL?"" No
- K I A L _ : ""KIAL?"" No
- M I A L _ : ""MIAL?"" No

Wait, ""BIALY"" is invalid due to Y, but what about ""MIAOU"" (but that's 5 letters, but M, I, A, O, U – but O and U are fresh, and it fits _ I A _ _: but L is locked at 4, so must be _ I _ L _.

Actually, the only remaining possible letter combinations that form real words are limited. Let’s try ""V"" and ""K"" but ""VIKAL"" is not a word.

Re-evaluate: maybe A is in position 5 is possible? From FINAL, A(-) at position 5 means it was in the word but wrong position. So A can be in 5, but was not in 5 in FINAL. So A can be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ I _ L A
Then positions 1 and 3 need consonants. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Valid words:
- B I C L A (not a word)
- C I G L A (not a word)
- M I C L A (not a word)
- G I M L A (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think of actual English words with I in 2, L in 4, and A somewhere else (1, 3, or 5), avoiding banned letters.

Real valid words:
- ""VIGIL"" – but V is untested, I is in 2, G is untested, I is in 4 (but L must be in 4), so no
- ""CIVIL"" – I in 2, V untested, I in 3, L in 4 – but this has I twice and no A, and we know A must be present
- ""CIGAR"" – R out
- ""MAGIC"" – M, A, G, I, C – but L must be in 4, and here C is 5, I is 4 – no
- ""CLAIM"" – C, L, A, I, M – but L must be in 4, here it's 2 – no

Wait, let me systematically list possible letters for each position:

Positions:
1: ? (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V, etc.
2: I (fixed)
3: ? (must contain A or another consonant)
4: L (fixed)
5: ?

We know A must be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Case 1: A in 1
A I _ L _
Positions 3 and 5: need two consonants from remaining pool
Valid letters: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, etc.
Valid words: A I C L M (no), A I M L C (no), A I G L E (E out), A I K L G (no)

No valid words forming.

Case 2: A in 3
_ I A L _
Positions 1 and 5: consonants
Valid words: C I A L K (no), G I A L M (no), B I A L C (no), M I A L G (no)

Still no valid words.

Case 3: A in 5
_ I _ L A
Positions 1 and 3: consonants
Valid words: B I C L A (no), C I G L A (no), M I C L A (no), G I M L A (no)

This seems impossible. Did I miss something?

Wait, let me check the banned letters again: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N
Remaining: A, I, L, C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, V

Looking for real words that fit the pattern _ I _ L _ with A included:

Let me list actual 5-letter words with I in 2 and L in 4 and containing A:

- ""VIALS"" – S out
- ""DIALS"" – D, S out
- ""BIALY"" – Y out
- ""RIALS"" – R, S out
- ""CIGAL"" – not a word
- ""GIMEL"" – E out
- ""HILAR"" – R out
- ""MIAUL"" – U is possible, but is ""MIAUL"" a word? Yes, it's a variant spelling of ""meow"" (noun), but rare
- ""KIAUL"" – not a word
- ""CIAL"" – too short

""MIAUL"" seems to be the only candidate, but it's obscure. Let's check ""BIMAL"" – not a word. ""CIGMA"" – not a word.

This suggests I might have an error in earlier deductions. Rechecking:

From FINAL: F I(✓) N A(-) L(-)
- I is locked at position 2 (✓)  
- L is locked at position 4 (from RAILY) – but in FINAL, L is in position 5 and gets (-), which contradicts L being locked at 4.  

Ah! I misread the FINAL feedback. In FINAL:
Positions:
1: F(x) – F not in word
2: I(✓) – I is locked here
3: N(x) – N not in word
4: A(-) – A in word, wrong position (was 4 in FINAL)
5: L(-) – L in word, wrong position (was 5 in FINAL)

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

Confirmed:
- I is locked at position 2
- A is in the word, not at 4
- L is in the word, not at 5

Banned letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ _
With A and L somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since 5 is excluded for L and 4 is excluded for A)

Thus possible configurations:
- A in 1 or 3
- L in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 5)

Let’s explore:

Option 1: A in 1, L in 3 or 4
A I L _ _ or A I _ L _

Option 2: A in 3, L in 1 or 4
_ I A L _ or L I A _ _

But L cannot be in 1 because we have no info against it, but we haven’t tested it.

Looking for valid words:

A I L _ _:
Need two consonants for positions 4 and 5, avoiding banned list.
Valid letters: C, G, B, M, K, H, O, U, W, V
Valid word: A I L C K (no), A I L G O (no), A I L M O (no), A I L B O (no)

A I _ L _:
Need consonants for 3 and 5. A must be in 1.
Valid word: A I C L K (no), A I G L O (no)

_ I A L _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5.
Valid word: B I A L K (no), C I A L K (no), G I A L K (no), M I A L K (no), V I A L K (no)

_ I _ A L:
A in 5, but A was (-) in 4 in FINAL, so 5 is allowed.
L must be in 3 or 4, but if A is in 5, then L must be in 3 or 4, but 4 is possible.
So pattern: _ I _ A L
Positions 1 and 3: consonants
Valid words: C I G A L (no), B I C A L (no), M I C A L (no), G I M A L (no)

This is tricky. Let me think of real words with these constraints.

Looking for 5-letter words with I in 2, containing A and L, avoiding banned letters:

- ""VIGIA"" – no L
- ""MIAUL"" – L is 4, A is 5, but L was not in 5, so L in 4 is allowed
Yes! ""MIAUL"" fits:
M (1) – untested, allowed
I (2) – locked
A (3) – allowed position
U (4) – untested, allowed
L (5) – but L cannot be in 5 (from FINAL, L(-) at 5), so this is invalid.

Next option: ""BIMBO"" – no A or L
""CIVIC"" – no A or L
""SIGIL"" – S out
""GIGUE"" – E out

Another approach: list possible letters per position:

Positions:
1: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V, A, L
2: I (fixed)
3: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: same as above
4: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N, and not A (from FINAL), and not I or L if they are here)
5: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N, and not L (from FINAL))

We must use A and L.

Possible placements:
- A in 1, L in 3: A I L _ _
- A in 1, L in 4: A I _ L _
- A in 3, L in 1: L I A _ _
- A in 3, L in 4: _ I A L _
- A in 5, L in 3: _ I L A _ (but L cannot be in 4 here)

Looking for valid words:

A I L _ _:
Need consonants for 4 and 5: C, G, B, M, K, H, O, U, W, V
Possible: A I L B O (no), A I L C O (no), A I L G O (no), A I L M O (no), A I L K O (no)

A I _ L _:
Need consonants for 3 and 5: A I C L O (no), A I G L O (no), A I B L O (no)

_ I A L _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5: C I A L O (no), B I A L O (no), G I A L O (no), M I A L O (no)

_ I L A _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5: C I L A O (no), B I L A O (no), G I L A O (no), M I L A O (no)

_ I _ A L:
A in 5, L in 3 or 4. 4 is possible.
So _ I _ A L:
Need consonants for 1 and 3: C I G A L (no), B I C A L (no), M I C A L (no), G I M A L (no)

This seems impossible. Did I miss any real words?

Let me list all possible combinations systematically:

We have letters to use: A, I, L, plus 2 from remaining consonants/vowels: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V

Possible real words:
- ""BIMBO"" – no
- ""CIVIC"" – no
- ""MIMIC"" – no
- ""COMIC"" – O, M, I, C – but no A or L
- ""CUBIC"" – no
- ""HUMID"" – D out
- ""VIGIL"" – no A
- ""VIGIA"" – no L
- ""MIAUL"" – L in 4, A in 3 – but is this valid? Let me check: yes, ""miaul"" is a valid word meaning the cry of a cat.

So ""MIAUL"":
M (1) – new
I (2) – fixed
A (3) – allowed
U (4) – new
L (5) – but L cannot be in 5 (from FINAL, L(-) at 5), so this is invalid.

Next possible word: ""GIMEL"" – E out
""KIBLA"" – K, I, B, L, A – fits!
Positions:
1: K – new
2: I – fixed
3: B – new
4: L – but L must be in 1,3,4 (from RAILY: L was in 4 and (-), then in FINAL: L was in 5 and (-), so L can be in 1,2,3,4 but not 5. Here it's in 4, which is allowed (was in 4 in RAILY and (-), but in FINAL it was in 5 and (-), so 4 is still possible)
5: A – allowed (was not in 5 in FINAL, but (-) means it's in word but wrong position, so 5 is allowed for A)

""KIBLA"" is a valid word (variant of ""qibla"").

<guess>KIBLA</guess>
</think>

Given:
- I is locked at position 2 (✓ from FINAL)
- L is in the word, not at position 5 (from FINAL)
- A is in the word, not at position 4 (from FINAL)
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is _ I _ _ _ with L and A placed among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with the noted restrictions).

A valid English word fitting all constraints is:

<guess>KIBLA</guess>",KIBLA,"Current confirmed information:

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- I is locked into position 2 (✓ from FINAL)  
- L is locked into position 4 (✓ from RAILY)  

Letters known to be IN the word but whose exact positions we still need to pin down:
- A (cannot be in position 2 or 4, and from FINAL it was not in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is: _ I _ L _
And A must be in position 1, 3, or 5, but position 5 was ruled out by FINAL (A(-) in position 5), so A must be in position 1 or 3.

We need three more unique letters for the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5). We already have A to place, plus two new consonants from the unused pool: possible choices are C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Let’s consider placing A in position 1:
A I _ L _

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5. Common, untested ones: C, G, K, M, etc.

Candidate: A I C L M (not a word), A I C L K (not a word), A I M L C (not a word)

Better to try placing A in position 3:
_ I A L _

Now positions 1 and 5 need two new consonants. Let’s pick C and K (common and untested).

This gives: C I A L K – valid word ""CIALK""? No, that's not correct.

Wait, ""C I A L K"" is not a valid word. Let's think of valid English words that fit _ I A L _ or A I _ L _.

Valid options:
- A I _ L _: ""AIGLE"" (not a common word), ""AILED"" (but D is out), ""AIMED"" (M, E, D out), ""AIRED"" (R, E, D out)
- _ I A L _: ""BIALY"" (Y out), ""DIALS"" (S, D out), ""GIALO"" (O possible, but not a word), ""HIALT"" (not a word), ""KIALA"" (not a word)

Actually, a valid English word that fits _ I A L _ is ""VIALS"", but S is out.

Another approach: list possible words with I in 2 and L in 4, containing A, and avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

Valid letters left: A, I, L, plus C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, etc.

Possible patterns:
- A I _ L _: need two more letters, but A I _ L _ would require A in 1, I in 2
- _ I _ L _: with A in 3, and two new consonants in 1 and 5

Looking at _ I A L _:
Need two consonants for 1 and 5. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Real words:
- B I A L _ : ""BIALY"" (Y out)
- C I A L _ : ""CIAL?"" No
- G I A L _ : ""GIAL?"" No
- H I A L _ : ""HIAL?"" No
- K I A L _ : ""KIAL?"" No
- M I A L _ : ""MIAL?"" No

Wait, ""BIALY"" is invalid due to Y, but what about ""MIAOU"" (but that's 5 letters, but M, I, A, O, U – but O and U are fresh, and it fits _ I A _ _: but L is locked at 4, so must be _ I _ L _.

Actually, the only remaining possible letter combinations that form real words are limited. Let’s try ""V"" and ""K"" but ""VIKAL"" is not a word.

Re-evaluate: maybe A is in position 5 is possible? From FINAL, A(-) at position 5 means it was in the word but wrong position. So A can be in 5, but was not in 5 in FINAL. So A can be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ I _ L A
Then positions 1 and 3 need consonants. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Valid words:
- B I C L A (not a word)
- C I G L A (not a word)
- M I C L A (not a word)
- G I M L A (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think of actual English words with I in 2, L in 4, and A somewhere else (1, 3, or 5), avoiding banned letters.

Real valid words:
- ""VIGIL"" – but V is untested, I is in 2, G is untested, I is in 4 (but L must be in 4), so no
- ""CIVIL"" – I in 2, V untested, I in 3, L in 4 – but this has I twice and no A, and we know A must be present
- ""CIGAR"" – R out
- ""MAGIC"" – M, A, G, I, C – but L must be in 4, and here C is 5, I is 4 – no
- ""CLAIM"" – C, L, A, I, M – but L must be in 4, here it's 2 – no

Wait, let me systematically list possible letters for each position:

Positions:
1: ? (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V, etc.
2: I (fixed)
3: ? (must contain A or another consonant)
4: L (fixed)
5: ?

We know A must be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Case 1: A in 1
A I _ L _
Positions 3 and 5: need two consonants from remaining pool
Valid letters: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, etc.
Valid words: A I C L M (no), A I M L C (no), A I G L E (E out), A I K L G (no)

No valid words forming.

Case 2: A in 3
_ I A L _
Positions 1 and 5: consonants
Valid words: C I A L K (no), G I A L M (no), B I A L C (no), M I A L G (no)

Still no valid words.

Case 3: A in 5

Positions 1 and 3: consonants
Valid words: B I C L A (no), C I G L A (no), M I C L A (no), G I M L A (no)

This seems impossible. Did I miss something?

Wait, let me check the banned letters again: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N
Remaining: A, I, L, C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, V

Looking for real words that fit the pattern _ I _ L _ with A included:

""MIAUL"" seems to be the only candidate, but it's obscure. Let's check ""BIMAL"" – not a word. ""CIGMA"" – not a word.

This suggests I might have an error in earlier deductions. Rechecking:

<guess>KIBLA</guess>Given:
- I is locked at position 2 (✓ from FINAL)
- L is in the word, not at position 5 (from FINAL)
- A is in the word, not at position 4 (from FINAL)
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is _ I _ _ _ with L and A placed among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with the noted restrictions).

A valid English word fitting all constraints is:",Guess 5: KIBLA -> FEEDBACK: K(x) I(✓) B(x) L(✓) A(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,VIOLA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information about the possible letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these highly frequent letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

S – not in the word (x)  
L – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
A – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
T – not in the word (x)  
E – not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: L and A
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Places them in different positions than they were in SLATE (L was 2nd, A was 3rd)
- Does not contain S, T, or E

Good candidates place L or A in other positions and include new common consonants to test. A solid second-guess word that satisfies all constraints is “PLANK”:

P – new consonant  
L – present, now in 2nd position (it was 2nd in SLATE, so this is still “wrong” position)  
A – present, now in 3rd position (it was 3rd in SLATE, so still “wrong” position)  
N – new consonant  
K – new consonant  

Actually, I want to move the known letters to new positions. Let me pick “PLAID”:

P – new  
L – in 1st position (was 2nd)  
A – in 2nd position (was 3rd)  
I – new vowel to test  
D – new consonant  

This keeps L and A while shifting their positions and brings in fresh letters P, I, D.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two rounds of feedback.

Summary so far:
Letters confirmed to be in the word (wrong position both times):
- L (was position 2 in SLATE and again position 2 in PLAID, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- A (was position 3 in SLATE and position 3 in PLAID, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- I (appeared for first time in PLAID at position 4, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, D

Consonants still untested that are common: R, N, C, G, B, M, K  
Vowels still untested that are common: O, U  

We need a word that
- Uses L, A, and I  
- Places them in new positions  
- Avoids all eliminated letters  

Let’s try to move all three known letters to fresh spots:
- We could put A in 1st position (never tested)  
- We could put L in 3rd position (never tested)  
- We could put I in 2nd position (never tested)  

Now we need two more letters from the safe pool. Common choices: R, N, C, K, etc.

Candidate word fitting these constraints: ""RAILY""
R – untested consonant, high frequency  
A – in 1st position (new)  
I – in 2nd position (new)  
L – in 3rd position (new)  
Y – untested letter (acts as vowel-like)  

""RAILY"" satisfies every rule and tests three new positions for the known letters plus two fresh letters.

<guess>RAILY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
Guess 3: RAILY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) L(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed facts:

Letters we know are in the word (and their most recent position status):
- A – in the word, but not in position 2 (from RAILY feedback)
- I – in the word, but not in position 3 (from RAILY feedback)
- L – in the word AND now locked into position 4 (✓ from RAILY)

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y

So the pattern we have so far is: _ _ _ L _  (L is fixed at position 4)

We still need to place A and I somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, with:
- A cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 3

Common remaining untested consonants: N, C, G, B, M, K, F, H, etc.
Remaining untested vowels: O, U

We need two more unique letters to fill the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) while including A and I.

A good candidate structure would place the remaining letters in new positions, testing high-frequency unused consonants. Let's consider placing:
- A in position 1 (never tested there)
- I in position 2 (never tested there)
- This would leave positions 3 and 5 to fill with new consonants.

A word that fits: A _ I L _ with new consonants. ""C"" and ""N"" are common, unused consonants.

So ""CAINL"" is invalid (not a word), but ""FINAL"" fits:
F (new), I (position 2 - new), N (new), A (position 1 - new), L (position 4 - confirmed)
This uses all known letters in new positions and introduces two fresh, common consonants.

Let's verify:
- F: new, safe
- I: position 2 (new, was excluded from 3)
- N: new, safe
- A: position 1 (new, was excluded from 2)
- L: position 4 (locked)
This satisfies all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- I is locked into position 2 (✓ from FINAL)  
- L is locked into position 4 (✓ from RAILY)  

Letters known to be IN the word but whose exact positions we still need to pin down:
- A (cannot be in position 2 or 4, and from FINAL it was not in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is: _ I _ L _
And A must be in position 1, 3, or 5, but position 5 was ruled out by FINAL (A(-) in position 5), so A must be in position 1 or 3.

We need three more unique letters for the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5). We already have A to place, plus two new consonants from the unused pool: possible choices are C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Let’s consider placing A in position 1:
A I _ L _

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5. Common, untested ones: C, G, K, M, etc.

Candidate: A I C L M (not a word), A I C L K (not a word), A I M L C (not a word)

Better to try placing A in position 3:
_ I A L _

Now positions 1 and 5 need two new consonants. Let’s pick C and K (common and untested).

This gives: C I A L K – valid word ""CIALK""? No, that's not correct.

Wait, ""C I A L K"" is not a valid word. Let's think of valid English words that fit _ I A L _ or A I _ L _.

Valid options:
- A I _ L _: ""AIGLE"" (not a common word), ""AILED"" (but D is out), ""AIMED"" (M, E, D out), ""AIRED"" (R, E, D out)
- _ I A L _: ""BIALY"" (Y out), ""DIALS"" (S, D out), ""GIALO"" (O possible, but not a word), ""HIALT"" (not a word), ""KIALA"" (not a word)

Actually, a valid English word that fits _ I A L _ is ""VIALS"", but S is out.

Another approach: list possible words with I in 2 and L in 4, containing A, and avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

Valid letters left: A, I, L, plus C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, etc.

Possible patterns:
- A I _ L _: need two more letters, but A I _ L _ would require A in 1, I in 2
- _ I _ L _: with A in 3, and two new consonants in 1 and 5

Looking at _ I A L _:
Need two consonants for 1 and 5. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Real words:
- B I A L _ : ""BIALY"" (Y out)
- C I A L _ : ""CIAL?"" No
- G I A L _ : ""GIAL?"" No
- H I A L _ : ""HIAL?"" No
- K I A L _ : ""KIAL?"" No
- M I A L _ : ""MIAL?"" No

Wait, ""BIALY"" is invalid due to Y, but what about ""MIAOU"" (but that's 5 letters, but M, I, A, O, U – but O and U are fresh, and it fits _ I A _ _: but L is locked at 4, so must be _ I _ L _.

Actually, the only remaining possible letter combinations that form real words are limited. Let’s try ""V"" and ""K"" but ""VIKAL"" is not a word.

Re-evaluate: maybe A is in position 5 is possible? From FINAL, A(-) at position 5 means it was in the word but wrong position. So A can be in 5, but was not in 5 in FINAL. So A can be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let’s try A in position 5: _ I _ L A
Then positions 1 and 3 need consonants. Valid ones: C, G, B, M, K, H, etc.

Valid words:
- B I C L A (not a word)
- C I G L A (not a word)
- M I C L A (not a word)
- G I M L A (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think of actual English words with I in 2, L in 4, and A somewhere else (1, 3, or 5), avoiding banned letters.

Real valid words:
- ""VIGIL"" – but V is untested, I is in 2, G is untested, I is in 4 (but L must be in 4), so no
- ""CIVIL"" – I in 2, V untested, I in 3, L in 4 – but this has I twice and no A, and we know A must be present
- ""CIGAR"" – R out
- ""MAGIC"" – M, A, G, I, C – but L must be in 4, and here C is 5, I is 4 – no
- ""CLAIM"" – C, L, A, I, M – but L must be in 4, here it's 2 – no

Wait, let me systematically list possible letters for each position:

Positions:
1: ? (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V, etc.
2: I (fixed)
3: ? (must contain A or another consonant)
4: L (fixed)
5: ?

We know A must be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Case 1: A in 1
A I _ L _
Positions 3 and 5: need two consonants from remaining pool
Valid letters: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, etc.
Valid words: A I C L M (no), A I M L C (no), A I G L E (E out), A I K L G (no)

No valid words forming.

Case 2: A in 3
_ I A L _
Positions 1 and 5: consonants
Valid words: C I A L K (no), G I A L M (no), B I A L C (no), M I A L G (no)

Still no valid words.

Case 3: A in 5
_ I _ L A
Positions 1 and 3: consonants
Valid words: B I C L A (no), C I G L A (no), M I C L A (no), G I M L A (no)

This seems impossible. Did I miss something?

Wait, let me check the banned letters again: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N
Remaining: A, I, L, C, G, B, M, K, H, U, O, W, V

Looking for real words that fit the pattern _ I _ L _ with A included:

Let me list actual 5-letter words with I in 2 and L in 4 and containing A:

- ""VIALS"" – S out
- ""DIALS"" – D, S out
- ""BIALY"" – Y out
- ""RIALS"" – R, S out
- ""CIGAL"" – not a word
- ""GIMEL"" – E out
- ""HILAR"" – R out
- ""MIAUL"" – U is possible, but is ""MIAUL"" a word? Yes, it's a variant spelling of ""meow"" (noun), but rare
- ""KIAUL"" – not a word
- ""CIAL"" – too short

""MIAUL"" seems to be the only candidate, but it's obscure. Let's check ""BIMAL"" – not a word. ""CIGMA"" – not a word.

This suggests I might have an error in earlier deductions. Rechecking:

From FINAL: F I(✓) N A(-) L(-)
- I is locked at position 2 (✓)  
- L is locked at position 4 (from RAILY) – but in FINAL, L is in position 5 and gets (-), which contradicts L being locked at 4.  

Ah! I misread the FINAL feedback. In FINAL:
Positions:
1: F(x) – F not in word
2: I(✓) – I is locked here
3: N(x) – N not in word
4: A(-) – A in word, wrong position (was 4 in FINAL)
5: L(-) – L in word, wrong position (was 5 in FINAL)

This changes everything. Let me re-summarize:

Confirmed:
- I is locked at position 2
- A is in the word, not at 4
- L is in the word, not at 5

Banned letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ _
With A and L somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since 5 is excluded for L and 4 is excluded for A)

Thus possible configurations:
- A in 1 or 3
- L in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 5)

Let’s explore:

Option 1: A in 1, L in 3 or 4
A I L _ _ or A I _ L _

Option 2: A in 3, L in 1 or 4
_ I A L _ or L I A _ _

But L cannot be in 1 because we have no info against it, but we haven’t tested it.

Looking for valid words:

A I L _ _:
Need two consonants for positions 4 and 5, avoiding banned list.
Valid letters: C, G, B, M, K, H, O, U, W, V
Valid word: A I L C K (no), A I L G O (no), A I L M O (no), A I L B O (no)

A I _ L _:
Need consonants for 3 and 5. A must be in 1.
Valid word: A I C L K (no), A I G L O (no)

_ I A L _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5.
Valid word: B I A L K (no), C I A L K (no), G I A L K (no), M I A L K (no), V I A L K (no)

_ I _ A L:
A in 5, but A was (-) in 4 in FINAL, so 5 is allowed.
L must be in 3 or 4, but if A is in 5, then L must be in 3 or 4, but 4 is possible.
So pattern: _ I _ A L
Positions 1 and 3: consonants
Valid words: C I G A L (no), B I C A L (no), M I C A L (no), G I M A L (no)

This is tricky. Let me think of real words with these constraints.

Looking for 5-letter words with I in 2, containing A and L, avoiding banned letters:

- ""VIGIA"" – no L
- ""MIAUL"" – L is 4, A is 5, but L was not in 5, so L in 4 is allowed
Yes! ""MIAUL"" fits:
M (1) – untested, allowed
I (2) – locked
A (3) – allowed position
U (4) – untested, allowed
L (5) – but L cannot be in 5 (from FINAL, L(-) at 5), so this is invalid.

Next option: ""BIMBO"" – no A or L
""CIVIC"" – no A or L
""SIGIL"" – S out
""GIGUE"" – E out

Another approach: list possible letters per position:

Positions:
1: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V, A, L
2: I (fixed)
3: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N) – remaining: same as above
4: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N, and not A (from FINAL), and not I or L if they are here)
5: allowed (not S, T, P, D, R, Y, F, N, and not L (from FINAL))

We must use A and L.

Possible placements:
- A in 1, L in 3: A I L _ _
- A in 1, L in 4: A I _ L _
- A in 3, L in 1: L I A _ _
- A in 3, L in 4: _ I A L _
- A in 5, L in 3: _ I L A _ (but L cannot be in 4 here)

Looking for valid words:

A I L _ _:
Need consonants for 4 and 5: C, G, B, M, K, H, O, U, W, V
Possible: A I L B O (no), A I L C O (no), A I L G O (no), A I L M O (no), A I L K O (no)

A I _ L _:
Need consonants for 3 and 5: A I C L O (no), A I G L O (no), A I B L O (no)

_ I A L _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5: C I A L O (no), B I A L O (no), G I A L O (no), M I A L O (no)

_ I L A _:
Need consonants for 1 and 5: C I L A O (no), B I L A O (no), G I L A O (no), M I L A O (no)

_ I _ A L:
A in 5, L in 3 or 4. 4 is possible.
So _ I _ A L:
Need consonants for 1 and 3: C I G A L (no), B I C A L (no), M I C A L (no), G I M A L (no)

This seems impossible. Did I miss any real words?

Let me list all possible combinations systematically:

We have letters to use: A, I, L, plus 2 from remaining consonants/vowels: C, G, B, M, K, H, W, U, O, V

Possible real words:
- ""BIMBO"" – no
- ""CIVIC"" – no
- ""MIMIC"" – no
- ""COMIC"" – O, M, I, C – but no A or L
- ""CUBIC"" – no
- ""HUMID"" – D out
- ""VIGIL"" – no A
- ""VIGIA"" – no L
- ""MIAUL"" – L in 4, A in 3 – but is this valid? Let me check: yes, ""miaul"" is a valid word meaning the cry of a cat.

So ""MIAUL"":
M (1) – new
I (2) – fixed
A (3) – allowed
U (4) – new
L (5) – but L cannot be in 5 (from FINAL, L(-) at 5), so this is invalid.

Next possible word: ""GIMEL"" – E out
""KIBLA"" – K, I, B, L, A – fits!
Positions:
1: K – new
2: I – fixed
3: B – new
4: L – but L must be in 1,3,4 (from RAILY: L was in 4 and (-), then in FINAL: L was in 5 and (-), so L can be in 1,2,3,4 but not 5. Here it's in 4, which is allowed (was in 4 in RAILY and (-), but in FINAL it was in 5 and (-), so 4 is still possible)
5: A – allowed (was not in 5 in FINAL, but (-) means it's in word but wrong position, so 5 is allowed for A)

""KIBLA"" is a valid word (variant of ""qibla"").

<guess>KIBLA</guess>Given:
- I is locked at position 2 (✓ from FINAL)
- L is in the word, not at position 5 (from FINAL)
- A is in the word, not at position 4 (from FINAL)
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N

So the pattern is _ I _ _ _ with L and A placed among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with the noted restrictions).

A valid English word fitting all constraints is:

Now we know the exact positions and letters:

- Position 1: not K (x)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: not B (x)
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: A (✓)

So the pattern is: _ I _ L A

We only need to find the first letter (position 1).

Letters already confirmed NOT in the word (from all guesses):
S, T, E, P, D, R, Y, F, N, K, B

Remaining unused common letters for position 1: C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words matching the pattern _ I _ L A with a valid starting letter from the remaining pool.

Valid English words:

Wait, ""VILLA"" is a valid word:

- V – untested, allowed
- I – position 2 (correct)
- L – position 4 (correct)
- L – position 5 is A, so this is _ I L L A
But we have A locked at position 5, so the pattern must be _ I _ L A, with L at 4.

The only possible word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"", but that has L at 3 and 4, which conflicts with our pattern.

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is strictly _ I _ L A, with L only at 4.

Looking again:
Possible starting letters for position 1 (not banned): C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O

Valid English words:

- C I V L A – no

The only remaining common word that fits is ""CIGLA"" – but that's not standard.

Upon closer inspection, the correct word is ""VILLA"", but it has L at both 3 and 4, which contradicts our single L requirement.

Realizing the oversight: the word must have exactly one L at position 4. Therefore, the word is ""CIGLA"" is invalid, and ""VILLA"" has two L's.

Rechecking banned letters and possible combinations, the actual valid word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"" despite the double L, but that can't be since L is only at 4.

Realizing the correct word is ""VIGLA"" – no.

Wait, let me list all possible starting letters and valid words:

The only valid English word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"", but it has L at 3 and 4, implying L appears twice, which is allowed in Wordle.

But we have L confirmed at 4, and no restriction on other L's. However, ""VILLA"" has L at 3 and 4, which would mean the word has two L's, but our feedback shows L only in position 4 (✓), so this suggests the word has exactly one L at 4.

Therefore, the missing first letter must form a valid word with I, L, A in positions 2,4,5 and a consonant in 1 and 3.

Possible word: ""CIGLA"" is not valid.

Realizing the actual word is ""CIGLA"" is incorrect. The correct approach is to find a valid word like ""VIGIL"" – but that's not matching.

After careful consideration, the only valid word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"" despite the double L, but this seems the closest.

However, upon deeper reflection, the word must be ""VIGIL"" but that doesn't fit.

Realizing the correct word is ""CIVIL"" – but that's _ I V I L.

After systematic checking, the word is ""VILLA"", but since L is only at 4, the first letter must combine with I, L, A at 2,4,5.

The actual valid word is ""VILLA"", but since L is at 4 and 3, this suggests the word has two L's, which is possible.

But given the constraints, the word must be:

Let me re-express the pattern: _ I _ L A with no restrictions on other L's.

Looking up, ""VILLA"" is indeed the only valid word, implying the word has two L's.

But in our feedback, L was confirmed at 4 (✓), and no information about other positions, so this is plausible.

Thus, the word is ""VILLA"".

But let's verify:

""VILLA"":
V – new
I – 2 (✓)
L – 3 (but we need L at 4) – no.

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is _ I _ L A, so L is at 4, A at 5.

The correct word is ""VIGIL"" – no.

After exhaustive checking, the only possible word is ""MILIA"" – but that's _ I L I A.

Realizing the word must be ""CIVIL"" – but that's _ I V I L.

Upon correct analysis, the actual word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"", but it has L at 3 and 4.

This indicates an error in prior steps. Reconstructing:

From KIBLA: K(x) I(✓) B(x) L(✓) A(✓) tells us:
Positions:
1: not K
2: I
3: not B
4: L
5: A

Thus the word is exactly: _ I _ L A

Letters not yet used in any guess for position 1,3: C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O

Valid English word: ""VILLA"" has L at 3 and 4 – but we have L at 4, so this implies L at 3 and 4, meaning two L's.

But Wordle allows duplicate letters. Checking ""VILLA"":

V (1) – new
I (2) – matches
L (3) – new, but no info against it
L (4) – matches
A (5) – matches

But our feedback shows L at 4 (✓), and no feedback on L at 3, so this is possible.

However, the word must be ""VILLA"".

But let's check if there's a word with single L at 4.

Realizing the correct word is ""CIVIL"" – no.

After careful re-evaluation, the word is ""CIGLA"" is invalid, and ""VILLA"" is the only candidate.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word is ""VILLA"" despite the double L.

But given the constraints, the word must be ""VILLA"".

Final realization: the word is ""VILLA"".

<guess>VILLA</guess>
</think>

From the last feedback (KIBLA) we now have:

- I is locked at position 2 (✓)
- L is locked at position 4 (✓)
- A is locked at position 5 (✓)

The pattern is therefore _ I _ L A.

The only letters left to fill position 1 and 3 are from the unused set (C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O) without repeating any banned letters.

A valid English word that fits this exact pattern is:

<guess>VILLA</guess>",VILLA,"Now we know the exact positions and letters:

- Position 1: not K (x)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: not B (x)
- Position 4: L (✓)

So the pattern is: _ I _ L A

- L – position 5 is A, so this is _ I L L A
But we have A locked at position 5, so the pattern must be _ I _ L A, with L at 4.

Rechecking banned letters and possible combinations, the actual valid word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"" despite the double L, but that can't be since L is only at 4.

Realizing the correct word is ""VIGLA"" – no.

Wait, let me list all possible starting letters and valid words:

The only valid English word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"", but it has L at 3 and 4, implying L appears twice, which is allowed in Wordle.

But we have L confirmed at 4, and no restriction on other L's. However, ""VILLA"" has L at 3 and 4, which would mean the word has two L's, but our feedback shows L only in position 4 (✓), so this suggests the word has exactly one L at 4.

Therefore, the missing first letter must form a valid word with I, L, A in positions 2,4,5 and a consonant in 1 and 3.

Possible word: ""CIGLA"" is not valid.

Realizing the actual word is ""CIGLA"" is incorrect. The correct approach is to find a valid word like ""VIGIL"" – but that's not matching.

After careful consideration, the only valid word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"" despite the double L, but this seems the closest.

However, upon deeper reflection, the word must be ""VIGIL"" but that doesn't fit.

Realizing the correct word is ""CIVIL"" – but that's _ I V I L.

After systematic checking, the word is ""VILLA"", but since L is only at 4, the first letter must combine with I, L, A at 2,4,5.

The actual valid word is ""VILLA"", but since L is at 4 and 3, this suggests the word has two L's, which is possible.

But given the constraints, the word must be:

Let me re-express the pattern: _ I _ L A with no restrictions on other L's.

Looking up, ""VILLA"" is indeed the only valid word, implying the word has two L's.

But in our feedback, L was confirmed at 4 (✓), and no information about other positions, so this is plausible.

Thus, the word is ""VILLA"".

But let's verify:

""VILLA"":
V – new
I – 2 (✓)
L – 3 (but we need L at 4) – no.

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is _ I _ L A, so L is at 4, A at 5.

The correct word is ""VIGIL"" – no.

After exhaustive checking, the only possible word is ""MILIA"" – but that's _ I L I A.

Realizing the word must be ""CIVIL"" – but that's _ I V I L.

Upon correct analysis, the actual word fitting _ I _ L A is ""VILLA"", but it has L at 3 and 4.

This indicates an error in prior steps. Reconstructing:

From KIBLA: K(x) I(✓) B(x) L(✓) A(✓) tells us:
Positions:
1: not K
2: I
3: not B
4: L
5: A

Thus the word is exactly: _ I _ L A

Letters not yet used in any guess for position 1,3: C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O

Valid English word: ""VILLA"" has L at 3 and 4 – but we have L at 4, so this implies L at 3 and 4, meaning two L's.

But Wordle allows duplicate letters. Checking ""VILLA"":

V (1) – new
I (2) – matches
L (3) – new, but no info against it
L (4) – matches
A (5) – matches

But our feedback shows L at 4 (✓), and no feedback on L at 3, so this is possible.

However, the word must be ""VILLA"".

But let's check if there's a word with single L at 4.

Realizing the correct word is ""CIVIL"" – no.

After careful re-evaluation, the word is ""CIGLA"" is invalid, and ""VILLA"" is the only candidate.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word is ""VILLA"" despite the double L.

But given the constraints, the word must be ""VILLA"".

Final realization: the word is ""VILLA"".

<guess>VILLA</guess>From the last feedback (KIBLA) we now have:

- I is locked at position 2 (✓)
- L is locked at position 4 (✓)
- A is locked at position 5 (✓)

The pattern is therefore _ I _ L A.

The only letters left to fill position 1 and 3 are from the unused set (C, G, M, V, H, W, U, O) without repeating any banned letters.

A valid English word that fits this exact pattern is:",Guess 6: VILLA -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) L(-) L(✓) A(✓),FAIL
