For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained by using a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. A good strategy is to use a word that includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:

- ""AUDIO"" (lots of vowels)
- ""RAISE"" (common letters including S and E)
- ""STARE"" (common letters and S/T/R/E)
- ""AROSE"" (vowels and common consonants)

Looking at letter frequency in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N are among the most common. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to detect letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are **not in the word at all** (x)
- E **is in the word but in the wrong position** (-), so E is present but not the last letter.

Observations:
1. The word contains an E, but not at position 5.
2. It does **not** contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Common consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.
4. Common vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and we know E is present).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
- Includes other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Good candidates: ""UNTIE"" (but uses U, N, T, I, E), ""UNTIL"" (but L is less common), ""TINIE"" (but double vowels might not help much).

I'll go with ""UNTIE"" because:
- It places E in position 4 (new spot).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.

From the two rounds of feedback:

- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I

So far we know:
1. The word contains at least one E, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
2. All consonants except the ones tested so far are still possible (no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
3. Vowels still possible: none except E (A, O, U, I are out).  Therefore the other letters must all be consonants or the word might have multiple E’s.

Good next guess:

- Use other very common consonants not yet eliminated: L, D, B, G, C, M.

Looking at letter frequency in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N are among the most common. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to detect letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are **not in the word at all** (x)
- E **is in the word but in the wrong position** (-), so E is present but not the last letter.

Observations:
1. The word contains an E, but not at position 5.
2. It does **not** contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Common consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.
4. Common vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and we know E is present).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
- Includes other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Good candidates: ""UNTIE"" (but uses U, N, T, I, E), ""UNTIL"" (but L is less common), ""TINIE"" (but double vowels might not help much).

I'll go with ""UNTIE"" because:
- It places E in position 4 (new spot).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.
- High-frequency letters in English.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: E (but not in positions 4 or 5)

So far we know:
1. The word contains at least one E, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
2. All consonants except the ones tested so far are still possible (no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
3. Vowels still possible: none except E (A, O, U, I are out).  Therefore the other letters must all be consonants or the word might have multiple E’s.

Good next guess:
- Put E in position 1 to test that slot first.
- Use other very common consonants not yet eliminated: L, D, B, G, C, M.
- Example candidate: ELDER (E, L, D, R, E) – but R is already ruled out, so discard.
- Another candidate: EMBED (E, M, B, E, D) – E’s in positions 1 and 4 (but we already know E isn’t in 4), so discard.
- Candidate that keeps E in position 1, uses fresh high-frequency consonants: B L E N D → E in 2, but we need to test E in 1.
- Let’s instead use E L D E R → again R is out.
- Better choice: E B L E M → E in 1 and 4 (4 is bad).
- Clean choice: E L D E R → R is out.
- Instead, pick E L D E S → S is out.
- Let’s pick E L D E N → E in 1 and 4 (4 is bad).
- Simple idea: just put E first and pick three fresh consonants plus another E if needed, but avoiding positions 4 and 5 for E.

- Next: E L E G E → double E, but we still need three more consonants.
- Try: E L D G Y → Y rare.
- Try: E L D G E → E in 5 (bad).
- Try: E L D G H → not a word.
- Let’s step back: we need a word with E in 1,2, or 3, avoiding all excluded letters (A,R,O,S,U,N,T,I) and using consonants from the remaining pool.

High-frequency remaining consonants: L, D, B, G, C, M, P, H, K, F, V, W, Y, Z.

So far we have:

Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, B, Y, D, G  
Confirmed present letters:  
- E must appear at least once, and cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from BELLY and LEDGE feedback).  
  Therefore **E must be in position 1**.  
- L must appear at least once, and cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from BELLY and LEDGE feedback), so **L must be in position 5**.

Thus the word looks like: E _ _ _ L

Available consonants (not yet ruled out): C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z, etc.  
Need three different consonants that haven’t been tried and that don’t repeat letters already used.

High-frequency choices: C, F, H, K, M.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form E X Y Z L.  
Examples: ECHOL (not a word), ESKIL (not), EPHIL (no), ECHIL (no), ESKUL (no).  
Actual English words:  
- ESKUL isn’t valid.  
- ESKIL isn’t.  
- ECHID isn’t.  

But **EPOCH** is 5 letters, ends in H not L.  
Wait, we need L in spot 5: E _ _ _ L.

Real words:  
- EXCEL → X, C allowed but ends in L, and is 5 letters.  
- EMBAL → B is ruled out.  
- EARLY → A, R, Y ruled out.  
- EAGLE → A, G ruled out.  
- ESKIL → not valid.  

Actually **EKKEL** isn’t valid.  
Another one: **EWKEL** isn’t.

- EQUAL → Q, U, A ruled out.  
- EXCEL → X, C allowed, ends in L.  
- ESKUL → no.  
- EGHUL → no.  
- ENZEL → no.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:

- ""AUDIO"" (lots of vowels)
- ""RAISE"" (common letters including S and E)
- ""STARE"" (common letters and S/T/R/E)
- ""AROSE"" (vowels and common consonants)

Looking at letter frequency in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N are among the most common. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to detect letters in the secret word.

- A, R, O, S are **not in the word at all** (x)

Observations:
1. The word contains an E, but not at position 5.

3. Common consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.
4. Common vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and we know E is present).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
- Includes other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Good candidates: ""UNTIE"" (but uses U, N, T, I, E), ""UNTIL"" (but L is less common), ""TINIE"" (but double vowels might not help much).

I'll go with ""UNTIE"" because:
- It places E in position 4 (new spot).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.
- High-frequency letters in English.

So far we know:
1. The word contains at least one E, and it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
2. All consonants except the ones tested so far are still possible (no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
3. Vowels still possible: none except E (A, O, U, I are out).  Therefore the other letters must all be consonants or the word might have multiple E’s.

Good next guess:
- Put E in position 1 to test that slot first.
- Use other very common consonants not yet eliminated: L, D, B, G, C, M.
- Example candidate: ELDER (E, L, D, R, E) – but R is already ruled out, so discard.
- Another candidate: EMBED (E, M, B, E, D) – E’s in positions 1 and 4 (but we already know E isn’t in 4), so discard.
- Candidate that keeps E in position 1, uses fresh high-frequency consonants: B L E N D → E in 2, but we need to test E in 1.
- Let’s instead use E L D E R → again R is out.
- Better choice: E B L E M → E in 1 and 4 (4 is bad).
- Clean choice: E L D E R → R is out.
- Instead, pick E L D E S → S is out.
- Let’s pick E L D E N → E in 1 and 4 (4 is bad).
- Simple idea: just put E first and pick three fresh consonants plus another E if needed, but avoiding positions 4 and 5 for E.
- Best simple word: E L D E R → R bad.
- Next: E L D E N → 4 bad.
- Next: E L B O W → O bad.

- Next: E L E P H → H may be low yield.
- Next: E L E G Y → Y is less common.
- Next: E L E C T → T is out.
- Next: E L E G E → double E, but we still need three more consonants.
- Try: E L D G Y → Y rare.
- Try: E L D G E → E in 5 (bad).
- Try: E L D G H → not a word.
- Let’s step back: we need a word with E in 1,2, or 3, avoiding all excluded letters (A,R,O,S,U,N,T,I) and using consonants from the remaining pool.

High-frequency remaining consonants: L, D, B, G, C, M, P, H, K, F, V, W, Y, Z.

- Y(x) → Y is **not in the word**.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, B, Y  
(plus we already know L must be in either 1 or 5, and E in 1, 3, or 5).

Remaining high-frequency consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.  
We know the word must contain **E** and **L** exactly once each (since neither has a ✓ yet, implying single occurrences).  
To place L and E correctly while avoiding already-ruled-out letters, we can test a word that:
- Places E in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4).  
- Places L in position 1 or 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out for L).  
- Uses only yet-untested consonants.

A search for common 5-letter words fitting these constraints:
- E _ _ _ L: e.g., EXCEL (X, C already ok), but X is allowed.  
- _ _ E _ L: but position 4 is bad for L.  
- L _ _ _ E: e.g., LEMME (M ok), LEFSE (F ok), LEDGE (D, G ok).

Let's try **LEDGE**:

Another one: **EWKEL** isn’t.  
Let me list proper 5-letter English words ending in L with E first:

- EQUAL → Q, U, A ruled out.  
- EXCEL → X, C allowed, ends in L.  
- ESKUL → no.  
- EGHUL → no.  
- ENZEL → no.  
- EMBEL → B ruled out.  

""EXCEL"" seems the only common candidate.  
But does it fit constraints?  
- E in 1 ✓  
- X, C, E, L letters:  
  – X, C, E not ruled out.  
  – Second E is allowed (word may have two E’s).  
So **EXCEL** is a valid guess.

Let’s try EXCEL.
