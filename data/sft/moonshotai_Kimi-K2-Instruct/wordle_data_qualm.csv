This is the first guess, so we have no prior feedback to work with. The best strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of letter positions

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ROAST (R,O,A,S,T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered one of the most optimal starting words, covering three common vowels (A,E) and three very common consonants (C,R,N).

From the feedback:
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ at index 2, 0-based).
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So the pattern is _ _ A _ _ with the known letters C, R, N, E excluded.

Next step:
1. Keep the A in the middle.
2. Use completely new letters for the remaining four positions.
3. Choose common letters not used yet: common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U, Y).

A good second guess should introduce many new letters while keeping A locked. Possible candidate words:
- STAIN (uses S, T, I, N – but N is already excluded)
- PLAID (P, L, I, D – but N is already excluded, N not here)
- MOATS (M, O, T, S – but A is fixed in 3rd position)
- STALL (repeats L, less ideal)
- PLUMB (but U is less common)

4. So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (1-based) i.e. indices 2, 3, 4. But index 2 is already A (✓). So L must be in index 3 or 4 (positions 4 or 5).

5. Pattern with L placed:

6. Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, K, M, S, U, V, W, Y.

7. We still need to test several of these quickly. A good next guess should:
   - keep A in the middle
   - place L in one of its two possible spots
   - introduce 3-4 new letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
   - BAGEL → contains E (already excluded) and G
   - GAMBL → not a valid word

   - WALKY → W, A, L, K, Y – has A in position 2 and L in position 3 (allowed). All letters new except A and L which we know are in the word.

""WALKY"" looks good—valid word, positions W A L K Y, uses new letters W,K,Y and places L in a possibly correct spot (position 3, index 2 is already A, so L in 4th position in 1-based, index 3). It’s worth testing.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so we have no prior feedback to work with. The best strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of letter positions

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ROAST (R,O,A,S,T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered one of the most optimal starting words, covering three common vowels (A,E) and three very common consonants (C,R,N).

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ at index 2, 0-based).
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So the pattern is _ _ A _ _ with the known letters C, R, N, E excluded.

Next step:
1. Keep the A in the middle.
2. Use completely new letters for the remaining four positions.
3. Choose common letters not used yet: common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U, Y).

A good second guess should introduce many new letters while keeping A locked. Possible candidate words:
- STAIN (uses S, T, I, N – but N is already excluded)
- PLAID (P, L, I, D – but N is already excluded, N not here)
- MOATS (M, O, T, S – but A is fixed in 3rd position)
- STALL (repeats L, less ideal)
- PLUMB (but U is less common)

""PLAID"" looks good: uses P, L, I, D – all new letters, keeps A in 3rd position, no repeats, and avoids excluded letters.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _  (A is locked in the 3rd position).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1).
- Letters not in the word: P, I, D (from Guess 2).
- Additional letter: L appears in the word but is NOT in position 2 (from Guess 2 feedback L(-)).

So we know:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- L is somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Need to try new letters: common remaining consonants (S, T, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.) and remaining vowels (O, U, Y).

Good next step is to test another batch of common letters while incorporating L in a new position and keeping A fixed. Possible candidates:
- STALL (but repeats L and S/T/L not optimal)
- BLAST (but S is new, but A is fixed in 3rd so BLAST would be B L A S T – but L can't be in 2nd)
- GLOAT (G, L, O, A, T – but A is fixed in 3rd so this is G L O A T – but O is 3rd, A is 3rd – conflict)
- FLOAT (F, L, O, A, T – same issue)
- LOATH (L, O, A, T, H – but A is 3rd, so L O A T H – positions: L(1) O(2) A(3) T(4) H(5) – this fits constraints: L not in 2nd, A fixed, all new letters)

""LOATH"" is a valid 5-letter word that uses L in position 1, O in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, H in 5. It introduces O, T, H as new letters and places L in a valid spot.

   - Guess 3 LOATH: L(-) O(x) A(✓) T(x) H(x) → L was in position 0 and feedback was “-” again.  
   Therefore L is in the word but NOT in positions 0 or 1.

4. So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (1-based) i.e. indices 2, 3, 4. But index 2 is already A (✓). So L must be in index 3 or 4 (positions 4 or 5).

5. Pattern with L placed:
   _ _ A L _   or   _ _ A _ L

6. Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, K, M, S, U, V, W, Y.

7. We still need to test several of these quickly. A good next guess should:

   - SALTY → S, A, L, T, Y – but T is already excluded
   - MALTY → M, A, L, T, Y – T excluded
   - GULAG → repeats G and U, and A is fixed
   - VAULT → U, A, L, T – T excluded
   - WALKY → W, A, L, K, Y – has A in position 2 and L in position 3 (allowed). All letters new except A and L which we know are in the word.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Position 3 (index 2) is **not** A.  
   - Guess 3 LOATH gave A(✓), so we were sure A was in position 3.  
   - But Guess 4 WALKY returned A(-), meaning A is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   Therefore our earlier assumption that A was locked in position 3 is now invalidated.  
   We must back-track: A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. Additional exclusions:
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, I, D, O, T, H, W, K, Y.  
   - Letters **confirmed** to be in the word: A, L (both have shown “-”).  
   - Position restrictions so far:
        – L cannot be in positions 0, 1, 3, 4 (because it received “-” every time it appeared in those slots).
        – The only remaining spot for L is position 2 (index 2).

3. Pattern now looks like: _ _ L _ _ with A somewhere else (positions 0,1,3,4) and neither A nor L can repeat.

4. Unused consonants still available: B, F, G, M, S, U, V.  
   Among these, let’s pick common ones to make a valid word.

5. Candidate words fitting _ _ L _ _ with A placed in one of the open slots:

   - No repeats, no excluded letters.

So the next guess is GLAMS.
</think>

<guess>GLAMS</guess>",GLAMS,"Let’s update what we now know:

1. Position 3 (index 2) is **not** A.  
   - Guess 3 LOATH gave A(✓), so we were sure A was in position 3.  
   - But Guess 4 WALKY returned A(-), meaning A is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   Therefore our earlier assumption that A was locked in position 3 is now invalidated.  
   We must back-track: A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. Additional exclusions:
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, I, D, O, T, H, W, K, Y.  
   - Letters **confirmed** to be in the word: A, L (both have shown “-”).  
   - Position restrictions so far:
        – L cannot be in positions 0, 1, 3, 4 (because it received “-” every time it appeared in those slots).
        – The only remaining spot for L is position 2 (index 2).

3. Pattern now looks like: _ _ L _ _ with A somewhere else (positions 0,1,3,4) and neither A nor L can repeat.

4. Unused consonants still available: B, F, G, M, S, U, V.  
   Among these, let’s pick common ones to make a valid word.

5. Candidate words fitting _ _ L _ _ with A placed in one of the open slots:
   - BLAND – but D excluded  
   - FLAME – but M and E okay? E is excluded.  
   - GLASS – S and S (repeats), also A in correct spot?  
   - SMALL – repeats L  
   - SALVO – S, A, L, V, O – O excluded  
   - VALVE – repeats V and E excluded  
   - GULAG – repeats G and U, and A, L positions not matching  
   - FINAL – I, N excluded  
   - MULCH – U, L, C, H – C, H excluded  
   - SALTY – T, Y excluded  

   The only remaining decent candidate that fits the constraints is **GLAMS** (G, L, A, M, S).  
   Checks:
   - L is in position 2 (index 2) – allowed.  
   - A is in position 3 (index 3) – allowed (not excluded).  
   - Uses new letters G, M, S.  
   - No repeats, no excluded letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,qualm,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so we have no prior feedback to work with. The best strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of letter positions

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ROAST (R,O,A,S,T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered one of the most optimal starting words, covering three common vowels (A,E) and three very common consonants (C,R,N).

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ at index 2, 0-based).
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So the pattern is _ _ A _ _ with the known letters C, R, N, E excluded.

Next step:
1. Keep the A in the middle.
2. Use completely new letters for the remaining four positions.
3. Choose common letters not used yet: common consonants (S, T, L, D, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U, Y).

A good second guess should introduce many new letters while keeping A locked. Possible candidate words:
- STAIN (uses S, T, I, N – but N is already excluded)
- PLAID (P, L, I, D – but N is already excluded, N not here)
- MOATS (M, O, T, S – but A is fixed in 3rd position)
- STALL (repeats L, less ideal)
- PLUMB (but U is less common)

""PLAID"" looks good: uses P, L, I, D – all new letters, keeps A in 3rd position, no repeats, and avoids excluded letters.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _  (A is locked in the 3rd position).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1).
- Letters not in the word: P, I, D (from Guess 2).
- Additional letter: L appears in the word but is NOT in position 2 (from Guess 2 feedback L(-)).

So we know:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- L is somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Need to try new letters: common remaining consonants (S, T, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.) and remaining vowels (O, U, Y).

Good next step is to test another batch of common letters while incorporating L in a new position and keeping A fixed. Possible candidates:
- STALL (but repeats L and S/T/L not optimal)
- BLAST (but S is new, but A is fixed in 3rd so BLAST would be B L A S T – but L can't be in 2nd)
- GLOAT (G, L, O, A, T – but A is fixed in 3rd so this is G L O A T – but O is 3rd, A is 3rd – conflict)
- FLOAT (F, L, O, A, T – same issue)
- LOATH (L, O, A, T, H – but A is 3rd, so L O A T H – positions: L(1) O(2) A(3) T(4) H(5) – this fits constraints: L not in 2nd, A fixed, all new letters)

""LOATH"" is a valid 5-letter word that uses L in position 1, O in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, H in 5. It introduces O, T, H as new letters and places L in a valid spot.

<guess>LOATH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: LOATH -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(✓) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. Position 3 (0-based index 2) is A.
   _ _ A _ _

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   C, R, N, E (from Guess 1)
   P, I, D (from Guess 2)
   O, T, H (from Guess 3)

3. Letter L appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (because in Guess 2 it was “-” at position 1 and in Guess 3 it was “-” at position 0). Wait—let’s re-read carefully:
   - Guess 2 PLAID: P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)  → L was in position 1 (index 0) and feedback was “-” (letter exists but wrong spot).  
   - Guess 3 LOATH: L(-) O(x) A(✓) T(x) H(x) → L was in position 0 and feedback was “-” again.  
   Therefore L is in the word but NOT in positions 0 or 1.

4. So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (1-based) i.e. indices 2, 3, 4. But index 2 is already A (✓). So L must be in index 3 or 4 (positions 4 or 5).

5. Pattern with L placed:
   _ _ A L _   or   _ _ A _ L

6. Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, K, M, S, U, V, W, Y.

7. We still need to test several of these quickly. A good next guess should:
   - keep A in the middle
   - place L in one of its two possible spots
   - introduce 3-4 new letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
   - BAGEL → contains E (already excluded) and G
   - GAMBL → not a valid word
   - SALTY → S, A, L, T, Y – but T is already excluded
   - MALTY → M, A, L, T, Y – T excluded
   - GULAG → repeats G and U, and A is fixed
   - VAULT → U, A, L, T – T excluded
   - WALKY → W, A, L, K, Y – has A in position 2 and L in position 3 (allowed). All letters new except A and L which we know are in the word.

""WALKY"" looks good—valid word, positions W A L K Y, uses new letters W,K,Y and places L in a possibly correct spot (position 3, index 2 is already A, so L in 4th position in 1-based, index 3). It’s worth testing.

5. Candidate words fitting _ _ L _ _ with A placed in one of the open slots:

Current summary (after Guess 5):

Known letters:
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (indices 1 or 2).  
  From Guess 1: A(✓) at index 2 was later contradicted by Guess 4 A(-) and Guess 5 A(✓) again at index 2.  
  Re-interpreting: Guess 1 CRANE → A(✓) actually indicated it was in the word but NOT in that exact position (common “present but wrong spot” symbol confusion).  
  Therefore A is definitely in the word but NOT at index 2 (position 3).

- L is in the word but NOT in indices 0,1,2,3 (positions 1,2,3,4) because every placement so far received “-”.  
  That leaves ONLY index 4 (position 5) for L.

- M is in the word but NOT at index 3 (position 4) from Guess 5.

- Letters already ruled out: C,R,N,E,P,I,D,O,T,H,W,K,Y,G,S.  
  Remaining consonants: B,F,M,L (but L already placed), and vowels: U (A already confirmed, E excluded, I excluded, O excluded).

Pattern so far:
- L must be the last letter: _ _ _ _ L
- A must appear once in positions 1,2,4 (indices 0,1,3) but NOT 3 or 5 (indices 2 or 4).
- M must appear once, not at index 3 (position 4) – but position 4 is L, so M must be in 1,2, or 3 (indices 0,1,2).

Possible slots:
- A could be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is L) → 1 or 2.
- M could be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ _ L with A and M each appearing exactly once in the first four spots, using only the still-allowed letters.

Allowed letters: A, M, B, F, U.  
We need one A and one M plus two other distinct allowed letters.

Candidates:
- FUMAL – uses F,U,M,A,L → L at 5, A at 4, M at 3, F at 1, U at 2.  
  Checks: A not at 3 (ok), M not at 4 (ok), all letters unused so far.

No other obvious valid words fit better.

Therefore, the next guess is FUMAL.

<guess>FUMAL</guess>",FUMAL,"Current summary (after Guess 5):

Known letters:
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (indices 1 or 2).  
  From Guess 1: A(✓) at index 2 was later contradicted by Guess 4 A(-) and Guess 5 A(✓) again at index 2.  
  Re-interpreting: Guess 1 CRANE → A(✓) actually indicated it was in the word but NOT in that exact position (common “present but wrong spot” symbol confusion).  
  Therefore A is definitely in the word but NOT at index 2 (position 3).

- L is in the word but NOT in indices 0,1,2,3 (positions 1,2,3,4) because every placement so far received “-”.  
  That leaves ONLY index 4 (position 5) for L.

- M is in the word but NOT at index 3 (position 4) from Guess 5.

- Letters already ruled out: C,R,N,E,P,I,D,O,T,H,W,K,Y,G,S.  
  Remaining consonants: B,F,M,L (but L already placed), and vowels: U (A already confirmed, E excluded, I excluded, O excluded).

Pattern so far:
- L must be the last letter: _ _ _ _ L
- A must appear once in positions 1,2,4 (indices 0,1,3) but NOT 3 or 5 (indices 2 or 4).
- M must appear once, not at index 3 (position 4) – but position 4 is L, so M must be in 1,2, or 3 (indices 0,1,2).

Possible slots:
- A could be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is L) → 1 or 2.
- M could be in 1, 2, or 3.
