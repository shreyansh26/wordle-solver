For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting words like CRANE, SLATE, or AUDIO are popular choices because they contain frequently used letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes several high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E) and is a good starting point for narrowing down possibilities.

From the two pieces of feedback:

CRANE ➜ C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
EARLY ➜ E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)

We can now deduce:

Letters **known to be in** the word: R, A, E  
Letters **known to be absent**: C, N, L, Y  

Positions to avoid for each included letter:
- R: cannot be in positions 2 (CRANE) or 3 (EARLY)
- A: cannot be in positions 3 (CRANE) or 2 (EARLY)
- E: cannot be in positions 5 (CRANE) or 1 (EARLY)

So the word:
- Must contain R, A, E exactly once each (unless one is doubled—but Wordle words rarely double these letters).
- May contain any of the remaining 20 letters not yet ruled out.
- Must place R, A, E in positions not already tested.

Next-guess strategy: pick a word that
1. Places R, A, E in completely new positions not yet tried.
2. Includes two new common consonants to maximize information gain.

Possible new positions:
- R: positions 1, 4, 5
- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- E: positions 2, 3, 4

A straightforward candidate that satisfies these constraints is “RAKE” but it’s only four letters. A valid five-letter word is “RAVER” but it repeats R.

- “PARER” – repeats R.
- “ARENA” – repeats A.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

CRANE ➜ C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
EARLY ➜ E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)

We can now deduce:

Letters **known to be in** the word: R, A, E  
Letters **known to be absent**: C, N, L, Y  

Positions to avoid for each included letter:
- R: cannot be in positions 2 (CRANE) or 3 (EARLY)
- A: cannot be in positions 3 (CRANE) or 2 (EARLY)
- E: cannot be in positions 5 (CRANE) or 1 (EARLY)

So the word:
- Must contain R, A, E exactly once each (unless one is doubled—but Wordle words rarely double these letters).
- May contain any of the remaining 20 letters not yet ruled out.
- Must place R, A, E in positions not already tested.

Next-guess strategy: pick a word that
1. Places R, A, E in completely new positions not yet tried.
2. Includes two new common consonants to maximize information gain.

Possible new positions:
- R: positions 1, 4, 5
- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- E: positions 2, 3, 4

A straightforward candidate that satisfies these constraints is “RAKE” but it’s only four letters. A valid five-letter word is “RAVER” but it repeats R.

Good five-letter choices without repeats:
- “PARER” – repeats R.
- “ARENA” – repeats A.
- “BREAD” – places A in the same position 3 as CRANE (invalid).

Next candidate: “BEARD”
- B and D are new letters.
- E in position 2 (never tried).
- A in position 4 (never tried).
- R in position 5 (never tried).

Positions:
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: E (allowed)
- Position 3: A (invalid – was position 3 in CRANE)
Oops, A would be in 3 again. Rejected.

Next candidate: “BREAD”
- A would again be in position 3 – invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAPE”
- G and P new.
- R in position 2 – already tried (CRANE). Invalid.

Next candidate: “GREAT”
- G and T new.
- R in position 2 – invalid.

Next candidate: “PEART”
- P and T new.
- E in position 2, A in position 3 – but A was in 3 in CRANE. Invalid.

Next candidate: “TAPER”
- T and P new.
- E in position 3 (never tried), A in position 2 (never tried), R in position 5 (never tried).

All constraints satisfied:
- T(1), A(2), P(3), E(4), R(5)
- A not in 3, E not in 5, R not in 2/3.

- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- P is not in the word (x)  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so E is fixed as the 4th letter.  
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is fixed as the 5th letter.

Current knowledge:
- Letters confirmed in the word and in their correct spots: E (pos 4), R (pos 5).
- Letters confirmed in the word but wrong spots: T, A.
- Letters ruled out: C, N, L, Y, P.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains both A and T somewhere in positions 1-3, and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Valid positions left to fill: 1, 2, 3.

Possible permutations:

Scanning valid English words ending in “ATER” or “TER…ER” etc., and avoiding any ruled-out letters, a very likely candidate is “WATER”:

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From the new feedback on WATER:

- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2.
- T(✓) – T is in the word AND in the correct position 3.
- E(✓) – E is already nailed in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is already nailed in position 5.

So the pattern now is: _ _ T E R

Letters still required:
- A (must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 2 only, since position 2 is now ruled out for A).
- One more distinct letter for the remaining blank (position 1 or 2), not any of C, N, L, Y, P, W.

Since A must be in position 1 or 2, and T is fixed at 3, the two possible skeletons are:
1. A _ T E R
2. _ A T E R   → but position 2 is now ruled out for A (feedback A(-) in WATER), so this is invalid.

Hence the skeleton must be A _ T E R.

We need a single letter for position 2 that:
- is not any of the already-excluded letters C, N, L, Y, P, W.
- forms a valid 5-letter English word.

Common remaining consonants that fit: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, S, V, etc.

Scanning common words of the form A?TER:
- AFTER – F is allowed → AFTER
- ALTER – L is excluded
- APTER – P is excluded
- ASTER – S is allowed
- ACTER – C is excluded
- ANTER – N is excluded

AFTER and ASTER are both valid. Choosing AFTER first (very common word).

Check:
A(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) – no conflicts with any feedback.
