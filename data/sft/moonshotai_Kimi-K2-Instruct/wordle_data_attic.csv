For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters and their positions. The word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include: ARISE, STARE, AUDIO, RAISE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- The word itself is valid and has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain

Possible candidates:

A good next guess would be ""ACIDY"" because:
- Starts with A
- Has I in position 3 → but wait, feedback said I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 in ARISE and got ""-"").
So I cannot have I in position 3. Let me pick another word.

Still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet tried and not in the excluded set.  
Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: none (only A and I are allowed, and they are already placed)

Looking for common combinations for positions 2-3:  
- “C” and “H” together give “CH”, which is common → A C H I _  
- “C” and “K” together give “CK”, also common → A C K I _  
- “M” and “N” together give “MN” or “M” followed by another consonant, but we need a 5-letter word.

Check if ACHIE is valid – no, it’s not a word.  
How about A C H I N – “ACHIN”? Not valid.  
What about A C H I N – no. Try “ACHIR”? Not valid.  
Actually, “ACHING” is 6 letters, so not usable.  
Next try: A C K I N – “ACKIN” – invalid.  
Try “ACINI”? Invalid.  
Try “ACING”? Invalid.  

Let’s try another consonant pair: “M” and “B” – A M B I – “AMBIS”? No.  
Try “AMBIT”? No, has T.  

Consider “A” + “N” + “C” + “I” + “L” – “ANCIL”? No.  

Wait – “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “N”? “ANGIN”? No.  

How about “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “A”? No repeated vowels allowed.  

Let me think of valid 5-letter words matching A _ _ I _ using only remaining letters.  
Possible word: A C I D Y? No, D and Y are allowed, but D is excluded.  
Wait, I excluded D already.  

Let me list available letters:  
Positions 2 and 3: must be from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z}  
Position 5: must be from same set, but avoid duplicates unless allowed.

Trying “A” + “M” + “B” + “I” + “A” – invalid.  
“AMBIG”? No.  
“AMBRY”? Y is available.  

Check if “AMBRY” is a valid word – yes, “ambry” (a type of cupboard).  
Letters: A, M, B, R, Y – but R is excluded! Cannot use.  

Next try: “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “A” – invalid.  
“ANGEL” – no, E excluded.  
“ANGRY” – no, R.  
“AMPLY” – P, L, Y allowed. Check: A M P L Y – letters: A, M, P, L, Y – none excluded.  
But does it fit A _ _ I _? No, I must be in position 4.  

I must have I in position 4. So pattern is A _ _ I _.  

Let me think of valid words:  
- A C I D S – S excluded  
- A C I N G – C, N, G allowed → “ACING” – but I is already in position 4, so this would be A C I N G – positions: A(1), C(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) – but I must be in 4, not 3. So no.  
- A F I N G – no.  
- A L I K E – E excluded.  
- A L I V E – E excluded.  
- A L I G N – letters: A, L, I, G, N – all allowed, and fits A _ _ I _ pattern? No, I is in position 3 here, but we need it in position 4.  

Wait, I need I in position 4, so the word must be A _ _ I _.  

Let me list possible 5-letter words ending with I: few English words end with I, but we have I in position 4, so last letter is variable.  

Actually, pattern is A _ _ I _ (I is 4th letter).  

Valid words:  
- A M I N O – but O excluded  
- A C I N T – no.  
- A C I N G – no, I in 3.  
- A C I D S – no.  

Real words fitting A _ _ I _:
- A C I N I – not valid.  
- A P I A N – A P I A N – positions: A(1), P(2), I(3), A(4), N(5) – but I must be in 4, so no.  
- A C I N G – no, I in 3.  

Actually, looking up valid 5-letter words with A _ _ I _:
- ACINI – plural of acinus, but not common.  
- AGING – but G, I, N allowed. Check positions: A(1), G(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) – no, I must be in 4.  

Let me try “A” + “B” + “I” + “D” – no, D excluded.  

Another approach: use remaining consonants.  
Let’s choose a word where positions 2 and 3 are common consonants, and position 5 is another common consonant.  

Try “A” + “B” + “C” + “I” + “M” – “ABCIM”? No.  

Valid word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – “ACHIN”? Not valid.  

“ACHING” is 6 letters.  

Real word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – not found.  

Next: “A” + “C” + “T” + “I” + “N” – “ACTIN” – yes!  
Letters: A, C, T, I, N – none excluded.  
Positions: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) – fits perfectly.  

Check excluded letters: C, T, N not excluded.  

This seems like the best next guess.

Actually, looking up valid 5-letter words with A _ _ I _:
- ACINI – plural of acinus, but not common.  
- AGING – but G, I, N allowed. Check positions: A(1), G(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) – no, I must be in 4.  

Let me try “A” + “B” + “I” + “D” – no, D excluded.  

Another approach: use remaining consonants.  
Let’s choose a word where positions 2 and 3 are common consonants, and position 5 is another common consonant.  

Try “A” + “B” + “C” + “I” + “M” – “ABCIM”? No.  

Valid word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – “ACHIN”? Not valid.  

“ACHING” is 6 letters.  

Real word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – not found.  

Next: “A” + “C” + “T” + “I” + “N” – “ACTIN” – yes!  
Letters: A, C, T, I, N – none excluded.  
Positions: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) – fits perfectly.  

Check excluded letters: C, T, N not excluded.  

This seems like the best next guess.From the feedback:
- Word starts with A (position 1)
- I is in position 4
- Eliminated letters: R, S, E, U, D, O

Pattern: A _ _ I _
Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters and their positions. The word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include: ARISE, STARE, AUDIO, RAISE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- The word itself is valid and has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the word and in position 1 → word starts with A
- I is in the word but not in position 3 → it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- R, S, E are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far: A _ _ _ _  
I must appear exactly once in positions 2, 4, or 5.

I want a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains I but not in position 3
- Uses none of the eliminated letters R, S, E

Trying some common consonants and vowels: A, I, N, T, L, D, M, O, U, C, etc.

Possible candidates:
- AIN’T (but contains apostrophe, invalid)
- ALOIN
- AUXIN
- AVION
- ACIDY

A good next guess would be ""ACIDY"" because:
- Starts with A
- Has I in position 3 → but wait, feedback said I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 in ARISE and got ""-"").
So I cannot have I in position 3. Let me pick another word.

Let me try ""AUDIO"":
- A in position 1 ✓
- I in position 4 ✓ (allowed)
- U, D, O are new letters
- None of the eliminated letters R, S, E are present

This seems good.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state:
- Word pattern: A _ _ I _

Still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet tried and not in the excluded set.  
Available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: none (only A and I are allowed, and they are already placed)

Looking for common combinations for positions 2-3:  
- “C” and “H” together give “CH”, which is common → A C H I _  
- “C” and “K” together give “CK”, also common → A C K I _  
- “M” and “N” together give “MN” or “M” followed by another consonant, but we need a 5-letter word.

Check if ACHIE is valid – no, it’s not a word.  
How about A C H I N – “ACHIN”? Not valid.  
What about A C H I N – no. Try “ACHIR”? Not valid.  
Actually, “ACHING” is 6 letters, so not usable.  
Next try: A C K I N – “ACKIN” – invalid.  
Try “ACINI”? Invalid.  
Try “ACING”? Invalid.  

Let’s try another consonant pair: “M” and “B” – A M B I – “AMBIS”? No.  
Try “AMBIT”? No, has T.  

Consider “A” + “N” + “C” + “I” + “L” – “ANCIL”? No.  

Wait – “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “N”? “ANGIN”? No.  

How about “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “A”? No repeated vowels allowed.  

Let me think of valid 5-letter words matching A _ _ I _ using only remaining letters.  
Possible word: A C I D Y? No, D and Y are allowed, but D is excluded.  
Wait, I excluded D already.  

Let me list available letters:  
Positions 2 and 3: must be from {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z}  
Position 5: must be from same set, but avoid duplicates unless allowed.

Trying “A” + “M” + “B” + “I” + “A” – invalid.  
“AMBIG”? No.  
“AMBRY”? Y is available.  

Check if “AMBRY” is a valid word – yes, “ambry” (a type of cupboard).  
Letters: A, M, B, R, Y – but R is excluded! Cannot use.  

Next try: “A” + “N” + “G” + “I” + “A” – invalid.  
“ANGEL” – no, E excluded.  
“ANGRY” – no, R.  
“AMPLY” – P, L, Y allowed. Check: A M P L Y – letters: A, M, P, L, Y – none excluded.  
But does it fit A _ _ I _? No, I must be in position 4.  

I must have I in position 4. So pattern is A _ _ I _.  

Let me think of valid words:  
- A C I D S – S excluded  
- A C I N G – C, N, G allowed → “ACING” – but I is already in position 4, so this would be A C I N G – positions: A(1), C(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) – but I must be in 4, not 3. So no.  
- A F I N G – no.  
- A L I K E – E excluded.  
- A L I V E – E excluded.  
- A L I G N – letters: A, L, I, G, N – all allowed, and fits A _ _ I _ pattern? No, I is in position 3 here, but we need it in position 4.  

Wait, I need I in position 4, so the word must be A _ _ I _.  

Let me list possible 5-letter words ending with I: few English words end with I, but we have I in position 4, so last letter is variable.  

Actually, pattern is A _ _ I _ (I is 4th letter).  

Valid words:  
- A M I N O – but O excluded  
- A C I N T – no.  
- A C I N G – no, I in 3.  
- A C I D S – no.  

Real words fitting A _ _ I _:
- A C I N I – not valid.  
- A P I A N – A P I A N – positions: A(1), P(2), I(3), A(4), N(5) – but I must be in 4, so no.  
- A C I N G – no, I in 3.  

Actually, looking up valid 5-letter words with A _ _ I _:
- ACINI – plural of acinus, but not common.  
- AGING – but G, I, N allowed. Check positions: A(1), G(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) – no, I must be in 4.  

Let me try “A” + “B” + “I” + “D” – no, D excluded.  

Another approach: use remaining consonants.  
Let’s choose a word where positions 2 and 3 are common consonants, and position 5 is another common consonant.  

Try “A” + “B” + “C” + “I” + “M” – “ABCIM”? No.  

Valid word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – “ACHIN”? Not valid.  

“ACHING” is 6 letters.  

Real word: “A” + “C” + “H” + “I” + “N” – not found.  

Next: “A” + “C” + “T” + “I” + “N” – “ACTIN” – yes!  
Letters: A, C, T, I, N – none excluded.  
Positions: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) – fits perfectly.  

Check excluded letters: C, T, N not excluded.  

This seems like the best next guess.From the feedback:
- Word starts with A (position 1)
- I is in position 4
- Eliminated letters: R, S, E, U, D, O

Pattern: A _ _ I _

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Let me re-examine the pattern: A _ T I C.

The only valid English 5-letter word matching this pattern is **ATTIC**, but it would require T at both positions 2 and 3, which is impossible because T is already fixed at position 3 and cannot repeat. Therefore, there must be an error in my deduction.

Re-evaluate feedback:
- ACTIN feedback: A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x)
- This means:
   – A, T, I are in correct positions 1,3,4
   – C is in word but not position 2
   – N is not in word

Therefore updated pattern: A _ T I _ with C somewhere in the word.

C cannot be in position 2 (since it was “-” there), so C must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be A _ T I C.

But no standard English word matches A _ T I C except possibly proper nouns.

Realizing I might have missed an allowed word, I check again and find that **ATTIC** is actually the only common 5-letter word ending in TIC besides ANTIC (N excluded) which fits the pattern, but it requires double T. Since double letters are allowed and T is already confirmed at position 3, **ATTIC** would place T at 2 and 3, but feedback for ACTIN shows T is correct at 3, so repeating T is acceptable if the word uses it twice.

Therefore, **ATTIC** is the correct next guess.

Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed at position 1.
- T is fixed at position 3.
- I is fixed at position 4.
- C is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 5.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Let me re-examine the pattern: A _ T I C.

The only valid English 5-letter word matching this pattern is **ATTIC**, but it would require T at both positions 2 and 3, which is impossible because T is already fixed at position 3 and cannot repeat. Therefore, there must be an error in my deduction.

Re-evaluate feedback:
- ACTIN feedback: A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x)
- This means:
   – A, T, I are in correct positions 1,3,4
   – C is in word but not position 2
   – N is not in word

Therefore updated pattern: A _ T I _ with C somewhere in the word.

C cannot be in position 2 (since it was “-” there), so C must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be A _ T I C.

But no standard English word matches A _ T I C except possibly proper nouns.

Realizing I might have missed an allowed word, I check again and find that **ATTIC** is actually the only common 5-letter word ending in TIC besides ANTIC (N excluded) which fits the pattern, but it requires double T. Since double letters are allowed and T is already confirmed at position 3, **ATTIC** would place T at 2 and 3, but feedback for ACTIN shows T is correct at 3, so repeating T is acceptable if the word uses it twice.

Therefore, **ATTIC** is the correct next guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed at position 1.
- T is fixed at position 3.
- I is fixed at position 4.
- C is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 5.
- N is eliminated.

The only valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern A _ T I C is **ATTIC**.",Guess 4: ATTIC -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
