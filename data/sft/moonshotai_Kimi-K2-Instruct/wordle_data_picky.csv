For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information regardless of what the secret word is.

All five letters in AROSE—A, R, O, S, E—are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely new set of letters.

A strong second‐guess should still use common consonants and vowels the previous word did not cover.  
Good candidates:  
- I, U (remaining common vowels)  
- N, T, L, D, C, B, M, P, H (common consonants not yet tried)

I’ll pick “UNTIL” because the letters U, N, T, I, L all rank high in frequency and give broad coverage.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) every letter was marked “x”, so we eliminated A, R, O, S, E.  
From Guess 2 (UNTIL) we now have an additional elimination list: U, N, T, L are all out, and only the letter I appears somewhere in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 4).

So far we’ve eliminated:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, L

Still-available common consonants and vowels include:
Vowels: I (already known to be in the word, but not in slot 4), and Y  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

A good next guess should:
1. Use the confirmed-in-word letter I (but not in position 4).
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been eliminated.

A strong candidate is “DIMPY”:  
- D, M, P, Y are all fresh and common.  
- I appears in second position, satisfying the “not in position 4” requirement.

This maximizes new information while respecting the feedback so far.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, which should provide useful information regardless of what the secret word is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE—A, R, O, S, E—are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely new set of letters.

A strong second‐guess should still use common consonants and vowels the previous word did not cover.  
Good candidates:  
- I, U (remaining common vowels)  
- N, T, L, D, C, B, M, P, H (common consonants not yet tried)

Looking for a 5-letter word that uses five fresh, frequent letters:

- UNTIL – uses U, N, T, I, L. All are new and fairly common.  
- CHIMP – C, H, I, M, P. Also all new and common.  
- BUILT – B, U, I, L, T. Same.

I’ll pick “UNTIL” because the letters U, N, T, I, L all rank high in frequency and give broad coverage.

So far we’ve eliminated:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, L

Still-available common consonants and vowels include:
Vowels: I (already known to be in the word, but not in slot 4), and Y  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

A good next guess should:
1. Use the confirmed-in-word letter I (but not in position 4).
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been eliminated.

A strong candidate is “DIMPY”:  
- D, M, P, Y are all fresh and common.  
- I appears in second position, satisfying the “not in position 4” requirement.

This maximizes new information while respecting the feedback so far.

6. Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.

7. Common two-consonant clusters that fit:
   - CK  → P I C K Y
   - FF  → P I F F Y (iffy, not a standard word)
   - GG  → P I G G Y
   - BB  → P I B B Y (invalid)
   - CC  → P I C C Y (invalid)
   - HH  → P I H H Y (invalid)
   - KK  → P I K K Y (invalid)
   - VV  → P I V V Y (invalid)
   - WW  → P I W W Y (invalid)
   - XX  → P I X X Y (invalid)

8. The only valid English word fitting P I _ _ Y and using allowed letters is “PIGGY”.

It uses P in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (required), G in 3, G in 4, and Y in 5 (required), and all letters are still allowed.
