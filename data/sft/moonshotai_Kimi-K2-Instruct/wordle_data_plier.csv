Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate possibilities early. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is correct in position 2.
- E is somewhere in the word but not position 5.
- S, A, T are not in the word at all.

- E must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T

Good next words should use:
- L in position 2
- E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4
- Common consonants not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc.

2. Eliminated letters: S, A, T, B, D

3. Remaining open positions: 1 and 3.

4. E also appears earlier in the word (position 1, 2, or 3) but NOT in position 3 because we just learned E is in position 4.  
   Therefore the remaining E must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is still open and position 1 is open.  
   However, since we already have an E in position 4, we need to decide whether to double-up on E or not.  
   But BLEED already tested two E’s and only one was correct in position 4, so the other E in position 3 is NOT correct.  
   That implies the remaining E must be in position 1.

So far, the pattern is: E L _ E _

That leaves position 3 to be filled with a letter not yet ruled out (not S, A, T, B, D).

From the latest feedback:

1. Correct letters and positions:
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - E in position 4 (✓)
   - R in position 5 (✓)

2. The E in position 1 is NOT correct (-), so the word does NOT start with E.

3. Eliminated letters so far: S, A, T, B, D, V.

So the known pattern is: _ L _ E R

We need to fill position 1 and 3 with letters that haven't been eliminated and are common in 5-letter words. The remaining letters that haven't been ruled out include: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,plier,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate possibilities early. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is correct in position 2.
- E is somewhere in the word but not position 5.
- S, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T

Good next words should use:
- L in position 2
- E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4
- Common consonants not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc.

A strong candidate is ""BLEED"":
- B: common starting letter
- L: confirmed in position 2
- E: can fit in position 3
- E: second E possible for position 4
- D: common ending consonant

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
1. Pattern: _ L _ E _
   – L is locked in position 2.
   – E is locked in position 4.

2. Eliminated letters: S, A, T, B, D

3. Remaining open positions: 1 and 3.

4. E also appears earlier in the word (position 1, 2, or 3) but NOT in position 3 because we just learned E is in position 4.  
   Therefore the remaining E must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is still open and position 1 is open.  
   However, since we already have an E in position 4, we need to decide whether to double-up on E or not.  
   But BLEED already tested two E’s and only one was correct in position 4, so the other E in position 3 is NOT correct.  
   That implies the remaining E must be in position 1.

So far, the pattern is: E L _ E _

That leaves position 3 to be filled with a letter not yet ruled out (not S, A, T, B, D).  
Common consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, W, Y, etc.

We also want to test a fresh consonant in position 5.  
Let’s try “ELVER”:
- E L V E R
- V is unused so far, R is unused so far, both are common letters.
