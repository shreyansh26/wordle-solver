2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Classic starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes the most common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) in English, providing a good baseline for elimination.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x).  
- R is in the word and is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).  
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- The word has the form _ R _ _ _
- A must appear somewhere other than in the third position.
- E must appear somewhere other than in the fifth position.
- Neither C nor N is in the word.

Good letters to keep: R (locked), A, E  
Letters to avoid: C, N

A logical next step is to try a word that keeps R in place, brings A and E into other positions, and introduces new common letters. ""BREAD"" is a common 5-letter word that fits these constraints. Let's test it:
- B (new letter)
- R (known correct)
- E (moved from fifth to third)
- A (moved from third to fourth)
- D (new letter)

This tests the presence of A in the fourth position and E in the third position while introducing two new consonants.
