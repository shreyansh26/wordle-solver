For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced word that covers several of these without repeating letters is ideal. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it covers common letters: S, L, A, T, E. Another good option is ""CRANE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - all high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all (marked x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked -).

So the word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.  
We also know the positions that A and E do NOT occupy: A is not in slot 3, and E is not in slot 5.

To maximize letter discovery in the second guess, we should avoid C, R, N and reuse A and E (in new positions) while bringing in fresh common letters.  
A classic “second-guess” word that satisfies these constraints is “ADIEU”:
- A and E are reused in new positions.
- Brings in D, I, U—three high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet.
- None of C, R, N appear.

“ADIEU” fits the 5-letter rule and should give us good information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (confirmed in position 1 by the ✓ in ADIEU)
   - D (confirmed in position 2 by the ✓ in ADIEU)
   - E (still somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5)

2. Letters known to be absent:
   - C, R, N (from CRANE)
   - I, U (from ADIEU)

3. Positional constraints so far:
   - Position 1: A
   - Position 2: D
   - Position 5: not E
   - Position 3: not A or E (from CRANE and ADIEU)

4. We have three slots left (positions 3, 4, 5) and must place E somewhere in them (since it must appear). The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include common ones like B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, Y, etc.

Strategy: choose a word that keeps A and D fixed in positions 1 and 2, places E somewhere in 3-5, and introduces new common letters for the remaining slots.

A good candidate is “ADOPT”:
- A in slot 1 (✓)
- D in slot 2 (✓)
- O, P, T are new untested letters (all common)
- E is not present, but that’s okay because we still need to test where E will fit; however, we need another test to find E’s correct spot. Instead, let’s pick a word that includes E to test its placement.

A better candidate is “ADEPT”:
- A in slot 1 (✓)
- D in slot 2 (✓)
- E in slot 3 (a new position for E, since it can’t be in 5)
- P and T are new untested letters.

This seems optimal for gathering maximal information.
