Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, a good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A popular and effective first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes common letters (S, L, T, E) and a vowel (A, E).
- The letters are diverse enough to provide useful feedback about their presence or absence in the secret word.

This is a balanced starting point that should give us good information to narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

""PRONE"" – but O and N/R are okay, P is new, and E is in position 4 (allowed).

- R – somewhere other than position 2  
- I – somewhere other than position 3  
- E – exactly in position 4 (✓)  
- D – somewhere other than position 5  

We still need to place R, I, D and pick two new letters for positions 1 and 2 (since 4 is fixed as E).  
Allowed consonants not yet tried: B, C, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels not yet tried: O, U (I is already known to be present elsewhere)

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ E _  (E is locked in 4th)  
Known letters to fit: R, I, D must each appear once.

A quick way to test placement of R, I, D is to pick a word that rearranges them with new starting consonants.  
Let’s try “HIDER”:
- H, I, D, E, R
- E is in 4th – ✓  
- I is in 2nd – allowed (we only know it’s not 3rd)  
- D is in 3rd – allowed (only ruled out 5th)  
- R is in 5th – allowed (only ruled out 2nd)  
- H is new and safe  
This word uses every known letter and adds H.

If any of R, I, D were actually in their correct spots we’d get ✓; if not, we’d get – and learn more.

Better: ""REIGN"" – R, E, I, G, N – E is in 2nd (allowed), uses I, avoids forbidden letters.  

""CHIME"" – C, H, I, M, E – E in 5th (invalid).  
""CHIDE"" – D is new, E in 5th (invalid).  

""CRANE"" has A (invalid).  

""PRICE"" – E in 5th (invalid).  
""PROBE"" – E in 5th (invalid).  

""FRIED"" – E in 4th (allowed), uses F, R, I, D, E – avoids S/L/A/T.  

""FRIED"" seems solid:
- Letters: F, R, I, E, D
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are new except E
- No S/L/A/T

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, F  
Letters confirmed to be in the word (wrong positions shown):  
- R – somewhere other than position 2  
- I – somewhere other than position 3  
- E – exactly in position 4 (✓)  
- D – somewhere other than position 5  

We still need to place R, I, D and pick two new letters for positions 1 and 2 (since 4 is fixed as E).  
Allowed consonants not yet tried: B, C, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels not yet tried: O, U (I is already known to be present elsewhere)

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ E _  (E is locked in 4th)  
Known letters to fit: R, I, D must each appear once.

A quick way to test placement of R, I, D is to pick a word that rearranges them with new starting consonants.  
Let’s try “HIDER”:
- H, I, D, E, R
- E is in 4th – ✓  
- I is in 2nd – allowed (we only know it’s not 3rd)  
- D is in 3rd – allowed (only ruled out 5th)  
- R is in 5th – allowed (only ruled out 2nd)  
- H is new and safe  
This word uses every known letter and adds H.

If any of R, I, D were actually in their correct spots we’d get ✓; if not, we’d get – and learn more.

The missing first letter must be a consonant that has not been eliminated yet (we’ve ruled out S, L, T, F, H).  
Available consonants include B, C, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z (and possibly others).  
We need a valid 5-letter English word matching “? I D E R”.

Common candidates: BIDER, CIDER, RIDER, WIDER, …  
RIDER – R is already used in slot 5 and we only have one R (no evidence of duplicates).  
CIDER – C is available and CIDER is a valid word.  
BIDER – valid but less common.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

A popular and effective first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes common letters (S, L, T, E) and a vowel (A, E).
- The letters are diverse enough to provide useful feedback about their presence or absence in the secret word.

This is a balanced starting point that should give us good information to narrow down future guesses.

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E, but not as the 5th letter.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.

Popular remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A balanced next guess that includes E, covers new consonants, and introduces new vowels: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N, E, A – but A is already ruled out.  
""PRONE"" – but O and N/R are okay, P is new, and E is in position 4 (allowed).
""PREEN"" – but double E may not be optimal.

""CRIME"" – C, R, I, M, E – avoids S/L/A/T, uses I and new consonants, E in 5th → but E can’t be 5th.  
Shift E earlier: ""MERIT"" – but T is ruled out.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,rider,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, a good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A popular and effective first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes common letters (S, L, T, E) and a vowel (A, E).
- The letters are diverse enough to provide useful feedback about their presence or absence in the secret word.

This is a balanced starting point that should give us good information to narrow down future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E, but not as the 5th letter.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.

Popular remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I, O, U (E is already known to be present).

A balanced next guess that includes E, covers new consonants, and introduces new vowels: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N, E, A – but A is already ruled out.  
""PRONE"" – but O and N/R are okay, P is new, and E is in position 4 (allowed).
""PREEN"" – but double E may not be optimal.

""CRIME"" – C, R, I, M, E – avoids S/L/A/T, uses I and new consonants, E in 5th → but E can’t be 5th.  
Shift E earlier: ""MERIT"" – but T is ruled out.  
""NERDY"" – but D and Y are okay, but D is new, E in 2nd.  

""PRONE"" seems good:
- P, R, O, N, E – no S/L/A/T, E in 5th → wait, E can't be 5th.  
Try ""PRONE"" with E in 4th: but it’s fixed as 5-letter.  

Better: ""REIGN"" – R, E, I, G, N – E is in 2nd (allowed), uses I, avoids forbidden letters.  

""CHIME"" – C, H, I, M, E – E in 5th (invalid).  
""CHIDE"" – D is new, E in 5th (invalid).  

""CRANE"" has A (invalid).  

""PRICE"" – E in 5th (invalid).  
""PROBE"" – E in 5th (invalid).  

""FRIED"" – E in 4th (allowed), uses F, R, I, D, E – avoids S/L/A/T.  

""FRIED"" seems solid:
- Letters: F, R, I, E, D
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are new except E
- No S/L/A/T

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, F  
Letters confirmed to be in the word (wrong positions shown):  
- R – somewhere other than position 2  
- I – somewhere other than position 3  
- E – exactly in position 4 (✓)  
- D – somewhere other than position 5  

We still need to place R, I, D and pick two new letters for positions 1 and 2 (since 4 is fixed as E).  
Allowed consonants not yet tried: B, C, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels not yet tried: O, U (I is already known to be present elsewhere)

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ E _  (E is locked in 4th)  
Known letters to fit: R, I, D must each appear once.

A quick way to test placement of R, I, D is to pick a word that rearranges them with new starting consonants.  
Let’s try “HIDER”:
- H, I, D, E, R
- E is in 4th – ✓  
- I is in 2nd – allowed (we only know it’s not 3rd)  
- D is in 3rd – allowed (only ruled out 5th)  
- R is in 5th – allowed (only ruled out 2nd)  
- H is new and safe  
This word uses every known letter and adds H.

If any of R, I, D were actually in their correct spots we’d get ✓; if not, we’d get – and learn more.

2. FRIED → F(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) D(-)

   – R, I, D all present, but not in their guess positions.  
3. HIDER → H(x) I(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – All four letters I, D, E, R are now locked into their exact slots.

So we know the pattern:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

The missing first letter must be a consonant that has not been eliminated yet (we’ve ruled out S, L, T, F, H).  
Available consonants include B, C, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z (and possibly others).  
We need a valid 5-letter English word matching “? I D E R”.

Common candidates: BIDER, CIDER, RIDER, WIDER, …  
RIDER – R is already used in slot 5 and we only have one R (no evidence of duplicates).  
CIDER – C is available and CIDER is a valid word.  
BIDER – valid but less common.  
WIDER – W is available but WIDER is 5 letters and valid.

Of these, CIDER is the most straightforward common word that fits all constraints.

So far we have:

Positions 2-5 are locked in as I-D-E-R.
Letters already shown NOT to be in the first slot: S, L, T, F, H, C, W.

All that remains is to pick the first letter.  
The only common English word matching ?IDER is “RIDER”, but we already know the last letter is R and we have no indication of a double-R.  
Beyond that, the remaining single-consonant starters that produce valid English words are sparse; the only other common candidate is “BIDER” (which is rare) and “GIDER” (non-word).  

Therefore the only realistic possibility left is:

R I D E R

Even though it repeats R, the feedback has never ruled out the same letter appearing twice. Let’s test it.
