For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and is likely to reveal information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. One popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination of letters should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we know:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is not in the word.

So far we have:
_ _ A _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S, T, A  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, E

Next, I want to test new letters while placing S and T in different positions. A good second guess is often one that introduces many fresh letters. A frequent recommendation is “AUDIO,” but that repeats O and I which we haven’t tested yet. Instead, I’ll pick a word that keeps A in position 3, shifts S and T around, and adds several new common consonants and vowels.

I’ll try “STAND”:
- keeps A in slot 3.
- moves S to slot 1 and T to slot 2 (neither was in those slots before).
- introduces N and D.

This should give us more information about S, T, N, and D, while respecting the constraints gathered so far.

From both guesses we now know:

1. Letters **A** is locked in the 3rd position.
   Pattern so far: `_ _ A _ _`

2. Letters confirmed to be **in** the word (but wrong positions so far):  
   S, T

3. Letters confirmed **not** in the word:  
   L, E, N, D

4. Need to place S and T somewhere other than positions already tried:
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (tried in SLATE and STAND respectively)  
   - T cannot be in positions 4 or 2 (tried in SLATE and STAND respectively)

5. We have not yet tested the letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word should
   - keep A in slot 3
   - place S and T in new, still-allowed positions (S could be 2,3,4 but 3 is already A ⇒ 2 or 4; T could be 1,3,5 but 3 is A ⇒ 1 or 5)
   - introduce several new letters.

One strong candidate is “CARAT”:
   - uses C, R, T, A
   - keeps A fixed in position 3
   - puts T in position 5 (new for T)
   - puts S in position 2 (new for S) via “SCART” but that’s not a valid word.

Another strong candidate is “PARTS”:
   - P, A, R, T, S
   - A in position 3
   - T in position 4 (was tried in SLATE in position 4 and got “-” so not acceptable; we need T in a new spot)
   - Therefore “PARTS” is invalid because T was already in slot 4 in SLATE.

A valid word that fits the constraints is “CRASH”:
   - C, R, A, S, H
   - A in slot 3
   - S in slot 4 (was only tried in 1 and 5 so far, so new)
   - T is missing here → we still need to place T.

So let’s look for a word that places S and T in fresh slots and introduces new letters. The word must contain both S and T (confirmed in word) plus A in slot 3.

Possible valid words:
   - “PASTA” – repeats A (invalid, since A already fixed in slot 3)
   - “VISTA” – S in slot 2 (new), T in slot 4 (tried before in SLATE, so invalid)
   - “WASTE” – contains E (already excluded)
   - “BASTE” – contains E
   - “CASTS” – repeats S
   - “HASTY” – contains Y, which is new, but T in slot 4 (tried before)
   - “FASTI” – contains F, I, S, T, but T in slot 4 (tried)
   - “BATSY” – contains E (no) and T in slot 4 (tried)

The best remaining option that puts S and T in new positions and adds fresh letters is:

“WARTS”
   - W, A, R, T, S
   - A fixed in slot 3
   - T in slot 4 (was tried in SLATE in slot 4) → invalid

“MARST” – not a standard English word.

“STARS” – S in 1 (tried), T in 2 (tried)

“TRASH” – T in 1 (new), R, A, S in 4 (new), H (new)
   - T in slot 1 (never tried)
   - S in slot 4 (never tried)
   - introduces R, H
   - all letters valid
   - the word is “TRASH”

Checks:
   - Letters used: T, R, A, S, H
   - A in slot 3 ✓
   - T in slot 1 (new) ✓
   - S in slot 4 (new) ✓
   - Letters R and H new ✓
   - Word is valid English.

Therefore: next guess = TRASH.
