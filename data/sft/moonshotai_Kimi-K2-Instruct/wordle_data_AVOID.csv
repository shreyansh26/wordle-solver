For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and will help me gather information about the secret word. A good first word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeated letters in the first guess to maximize information

Some popular first guesses are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it uses the five most common letters in English words and covers both vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on “AROSE”:

A(✓) – the first letter is A and is in the correct spot.

R(x) – R is not in the word at all.

O(✓) – the third letter is O and is in the correct spot.

S(x) – S is not in the word.

E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the target word has the form: A _ O _ _

Letters we already know are absent: R, S, E.

To maximize information and avoid those absent letters, a good next word should:
- keep A and O fixed in positions 1 and 3.
- use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried.
- avoid R, S, E.

A useful consonant set to test next might be T, N, L, C, etc.

Candidate words that fit A _ O _ _ and avoid the excluded letters:
- AGOON – but repeats O.
- ATONE – contains E (already ruled out).
- AFOOT – contains a second O and repeats O.
- ALOOF – contains F and L, avoids R,S,E.
- ABODE – contains B and D, avoids R,S,E.
- ADORN – contains R (ruled out).

“ABODE” looks good: it has B and D (new letters), keeps A and O, and avoids R,S,E.

Another clean choice is “ALONG” (L, N, G), but let’s choose “ABODE” because it introduces B and D while fitting the pattern perfectly.

From all feedback so far:

Known solid positions:
- Position 1 = A
- Position 3 = O

Known letters NOT in the word (ever): R, S, E, B

Known letter D: it is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So D must sit in position 2 or 5.

Pattern so far: A _ O _ _  or  A _ O _ D

Letters still untested that are common: C, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Starts with A, has O in 3rd place.
- Contains D exactly once, not in 4th place.
- Uses only letters we have not ruled out.

Let’s look for possibilities:

A D O _ _   → ADOBE (has B, already ruled out), ADOPT (P, T untested – valid)
A _ O _ D   → ACOID (not a word), AFOID (not a word), AVOID (valid!), ACOLD (valid), AMIDO (not common), ANODE (valid)

Among these, “AVOID” and “ANODE” are common words.  
“AVOID” uses V (new), I (new).  
“ANODE” uses N (new), E (already ruled out) → discard.

Therefore best next candidate: “AVOID”.

It satisfies:
- A(✓) _ O(✓) _ D(-)  → positions 1 and 3 locked, D not in 5th, so D must be in 2nd place?  Wait: AVOID has D in 5th!  
That would contradict the feedback D(-) (letter D exists but not in 4th, so 5th is still allowed).  
So AVOID: A _ O _ D is okay.

Let me double-check:
AVOID  → A(✓) V(new) O(✓) I(new) D(-)  → the feedback for D would be (-) because D exists but not in position 4 (it’s in 5); that’s fine.

Another quick candidate: ADOPT – D in 2nd place, P,T new.  
Either is reasonable, but “AVOID” tests V and I, both fresh letters.

I’ll go with “AVOID”.
