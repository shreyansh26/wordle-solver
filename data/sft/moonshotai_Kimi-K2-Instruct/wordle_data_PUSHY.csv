Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A strong first guess would contain several of these high-frequency letters to test multiple positions at once. Some popular opening words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains very common letters that should give good information about the presence/absence of these letters and their positions.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 → possible positions: 2,3,4,5
- T, A, R, E are NOT in the word at all

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in slot 1)
2. Contains none of T, A, R, E
3. Has 4 other letters (all different and not T/A/R/E/S)

Common consonants left to try: C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.
Vowels left: I, O, U, Y

Let’s build a candidate:
- Must have S somewhere in positions 2-5
- No T/A/R/E
- Good letters to include: I, O, N, L, C, H, M, etc.

A good second guess that fits: SHOWN
- S is in position 1 (invalid per feedback, oops!) → scratch that.

Next candidate: SNICK
- S in position 1 again (invalid) → scratch.

Try: CHINS
- S in position 5, no T/A/R/E → good.

Another: NISPY
- S in position 2, no T/A/R/E → valid.

But let’s pick a more common word: SHOCK
- S in position 1 (invalid) → no.

Valid option: PISON
- S in position 3, no T/A/R/E → valid.

Better common word: SLING
- S in position 1 (invalid) → no.

- C H I N S → no T/A/R/E, S in position 5 → valid.

- Letters we KNOW are in the word: S and H.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).  
- H cannot be in position 2 (from guess 2).

Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
H must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2).

- Has S not in positions 1 or 5.  
- Has H not in position 2.

- Place H in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

  – If H is in position 4: _S__H → good.  
  – If H is in position 5: _S___H → already S can’t be in position 5, so this is possible.

1. _S_H_:  
   - Possible letters (not T,A,R,E,C,I,N): D,G,L,M,O,P,U,Y.  
   - Try combinations:

     – D O S H Y (invalid order).  
     – P U S H Y → PUSHY (but Y is allowed, and letters are P,U,S,H,Y).  
     – Check: P, U, S, H, Y — none are forbidden, S is in position 3 (allowed), H in 4 (allowed).  
     – PUSHY is a valid 5-letter word.

2. Other options:
