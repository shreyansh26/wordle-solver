For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another common vowel
- S: Very common letter, especially in plurals
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination should give us good information about the presence/absence of several common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but wrong position (originally position 1)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- I, S are not in the word
- E is in the word but wrong position (originally position 5)

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A fixed in position 2 (second letter)
2. Contains R somewhere other than first position
3. Contains E somewhere other than last position
4. Does not contain I or S

Let’s try to build such a word:
- Second letter must be A
- Try placing R in position 3: _ A R _ _
- E cannot be last, so try position 4: _ A R E _
- Need first and fifth letters, avoiding I/S. Try common consonants like D, N, T, L, etc.
- ""DARED"" fits: D A R E D, but E is in position 4 (allowed), R in 3, A in 2. However, D is repeated – maybe not ideal.
- ""CARED"": C A R E D – good, no repeats, avoids I/S, A in 2, R not first, E not last.

""CARED"" seems like a strong second guess given the constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another common vowel
- S: Very common letter, especially in plurals
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination should give us good information about the presence/absence of several common letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

- R is in the word but wrong position (originally position 1)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- I, S are not in the word
- E is in the word but wrong position (originally position 5)

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A fixed in position 2 (second letter)
2. Contains R somewhere other than first position
3. Contains E somewhere other than last position
4. Does not contain I or S

Let’s try to build such a word:
- Second letter must be A
- Try placing R in position 3: _ A R _ _
- E cannot be last, so try position 4: _ A R E _
- Need first and fifth letters, avoiding I/S. Try common consonants like D, N, T, L, etc.
- ""DARED"" fits: D A R E D, but E is in position 4 (allowed), R in 3, A in 2. However, D is repeated – maybe not ideal.
- ""CARED"": C A R E D – good, no repeats, avoids I/S, A in 2, R not first, E not last.

So our pattern is: _ A R E _ 

We need a 5-letter word that:

(i.e. positions 2–5 are A, R, E, R).  

The first letter cannot be any of the already-eliminated letters:  
B, C, D, H, I, M, S.

That leaves us needing a 5-letter word that begins with one of the remaining letters and ends in “ARER”.  
Scanning common English words, the only everyday 5-letter word that fits is:  

F A R E R  

F has not been ruled out, and every other letter (A, R, E, R) is confirmed.  
Therefore “FARER” is the logical next guess.
