For the first guess, there's no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English, which can help reveal as much information as possible. A common choice is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage for the first guess to gather information about the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word at all.

We know the word contains A, R, O, S but NOT E.  
We also know none of these letters is in the position they occupied in AROSE (i.e., A not at 1, R not at 2, O not at 3, S not at 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A, R, O, S somewhere (each only once, since Wordle uses single-letter feedback per position).
- Does not contain E.
- Moves each of A, R, O, S to new positions.

A good candidate that uses these letters and introduces new consonants for information is ""ROAST"":
- R moves from position 2 to position 1 (allowed, since R must not be in position 2).
- O moves from position 3 to position 2 (allowed).
- A moves from position 1 to position 3 (allowed).
- S moves from position 4 to position 4 (this is NOT allowed, since S must not be in position 4).

So ""ROAST"" is invalid because S stays at position 4.

Next option: ""SAVOR"":
- S at 1 (allowed, S was at 4)
- A at 2 (allowed, A was at 1)
- V (new letter)
- O at 4 (allowed, O was at 3)
- R at 5 (allowed, R was at 2)

This uses all known letters correctly (A, R, O, S) and introduces V as a new letter to test. It also avoids E entirely.

Another check: ""SAVOR"" is a valid 5-letter English word.
