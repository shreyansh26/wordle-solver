For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting hits. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to get as much information as possible. 

Looking at 5-letter words that use these common letters, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all among the top 10 most common letters. This should give good coverage for initial feedback.

Alternative good starting words could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly balanced in terms of consonant/vowel distribution and letter frequency.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – correct position (3rd letter)
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct position (5th letter)

So the secret word has:
- the 3rd letter is O
- the 5th letter is E
- the letters A, R, S are not present
- we still need to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 4th letters

We know nothing about the remaining letters yet. The most common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, M, P. Vowels left to consider are I and U (A and O are taken, E is fixed at the end).

A good next guess would incorporate many of these remaining high-frequency letters while keeping O in position 3 and E in position 5. The word ""POINT"" would be strong, but it re-uses the letter T which we don’t know yet. Instead, let’s try ""MOUTH"" – it uses M, U, T, H along with the known O and E positions.

However, ""MOUTH"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong (O must be position 3). So let’s adjust.

We need a word with the pattern _ _ O _ E. Common letters to test are T, N, L, C, M, P, U, I. ""CHONE"" uses C and H but is less common. ""PHONE"" is better but P and H are moderate frequency. ""TONER"" uses T, N but R is already eliminated.

Wait – R is eliminated, so ""TONER"" is bad (has R). ""TONEY"" is not a valid word. ""POISE"" is invalid (S is eliminated). ""VOICE"" is invalid (S eliminated).

Let’s try ""CLOVE"" – C, L, V are all reasonable, and it fits _ _ O _ E. But V is lower frequency. ""DOWNE"" uses D, W, N – not great. ""GLOVE"" uses G, L, V – G is low.

Better choice: ""OZONE"" – but that repeats O, and Z is low frequency. ""WOKE"" is 4 letters.

Best seems ""CLOVE"" or ""PHONE"". Between these, ""PHONE"" uses P, H, O, N, E – P and N are common, H is moderate. It’s a valid word and fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Hence, the next guess will be PHONE.

From the two guesses we have the following fixed information:

- O is in position 3 (✓ twice).
- E is in position 5 (✓ twice).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, P, H, N.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining high-frequency letters to test: T, L, C, M, D, I, U, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

We want a word that fills positions 1, 2 and 4 with letters not yet tried. A strong next guess would use several new common letters. One good candidate is “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency and L/O/C are still possible. However we know O and E positions already.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. T _ O _ E → common letters: T, I, L, U, D, M, C, etc.
   - Valid words: TIDIE (invalid), TULLE (invalid), TITRE (invalid), etc.

2. L _ O _ E → LOUIE (invalid spelling?), LONGE (valid but obscure), LOPE (4 letters).

3. C _ O _ E → CLOVE (V is low), COMBE (M/B used yet), etc.

4. D _ O _ E → DOWSE (S ruled out), DOMED (second D is in position 4), DOZER (Z low).

5. M _ O _ E → MONDE (N ruled out), MOVIE (V low).

6. F _ O _ E → FLOTE (not a word), FORCE (R ruled out).

7. B _ O _ E → BLOKE (L/K), BROKE (R ruled out).

8. W _ O _ E → WOOZE (Z low), WOMBE (not valid).

9. G _ O _ E → GLOBE (L/B), GROPE (R ruled out).

10. K _ O _ E → KNOLE (N ruled out), KOPEK (K/K).

Best seems “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency. Next best is “BLOKE” – uses B, L, K (all untried).

However, “BLOKE” is a valid word and uses three new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Other candidates: “GLOBE” (G/B/L), “FLOTE” (invalid), “MOXIE” (X low). I’ll go with “BLOKE”.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, L, O, K, E. O and E are in correct positions. B, L, K are all new letters. This seems optimal.

However, let me sanity-check if there’s a better word with more common letters. 

Another candidate: “TOWEL” – but it has L in position 5 which is incorrect (must be E). 

“TROPE” – R ruled out.

“TOILE” – I is new, L is new, T is new. This is better: T, O, I, L, E. All letters fit pattern _ _ O _ E and none are ruled out except O/E which are correct.

Yes, “TOILE” is a valid word and uses T, I, L which are all high-frequency untried letters. This seems superior to “BLOKE”.

Hence, the next guess will be TOILE.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to get as much information as possible. 

Looking at 5-letter words that use these common letters, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all among the top 10 most common letters. This should give good coverage for initial feedback.

Alternative good starting words could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly balanced in terms of consonant/vowel distribution and letter frequency.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – correct position (3rd letter)
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct position (5th letter)

So the secret word has:
- the 3rd letter is O
- the 5th letter is E
- the letters A, R, S are not present
- we still need to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 4th letters

We know nothing about the remaining letters yet. The most common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, M, P. Vowels left to consider are I and U (A and O are taken, E is fixed at the end).

A good next guess would incorporate many of these remaining high-frequency letters while keeping O in position 3 and E in position 5. The word ""POINT"" would be strong, but it re-uses the letter T which we don’t know yet. Instead, let’s try ""MOUTH"" – it uses M, U, T, H along with the known O and E positions.

However, ""MOUTH"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong (O must be position 3). So let’s adjust.

We need a word with the pattern _ _ O _ E. Common letters to test are T, N, L, C, M, P, U, I. ""CHONE"" uses C and H but is less common. ""PHONE"" is better but P and H are moderate frequency. ""TONER"" uses T, N but R is already eliminated.

Wait – R is eliminated, so ""TONER"" is bad (has R). ""TONEY"" is not a valid word. ""POISE"" is invalid (S is eliminated). ""VOICE"" is invalid (S eliminated).

Let’s try ""CLOVE"" – C, L, V are all reasonable, and it fits _ _ O _ E. But V is lower frequency. ""DOWNE"" uses D, W, N – not great. ""GLOVE"" uses G, L, V – G is low.

Better choice: ""OZONE"" – but that repeats O, and Z is low frequency. ""WOKE"" is 4 letters.

Best seems ""CLOVE"" or ""PHONE"". Between these, ""PHONE"" uses P, H, O, N, E – P and N are common, H is moderate. It’s a valid word and fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Hence, the next guess will be PHONE.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have the following fixed information:

- O is in position 3 (✓ twice).
- E is in position 5 (✓ twice).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, P, H, N.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining high-frequency letters to test: T, L, C, M, D, I, U, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

We want a word that fills positions 1, 2 and 4 with letters not yet tried. A strong next guess would use several new common letters. One good candidate is “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency and L/O/C are still possible. However we know O and E positions already.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. T _ O _ E → common letters: T, I, L, U, D, M, C, etc.
   - Valid words: TIDIE (invalid), TULLE (invalid), TITRE (invalid), etc.

2. L _ O _ E → LOUIE (invalid spelling?), LONGE (valid but obscure), LOPE (4 letters).

3. C _ O _ E → CLOVE (V is low), COMBE (M/B used yet), etc.

4. D _ O _ E → DOWSE (S ruled out), DOMED (second D is in position 4), DOZER (Z low).

5. M _ O _ E → MONDE (N ruled out), MOVIE (V low).

6. F _ O _ E → FLOTE (not a word), FORCE (R ruled out).

7. B _ O _ E → BLOKE (L/K), BROKE (R ruled out).

8. W _ O _ E → WOOZE (Z low), WOMBE (not valid).

9. G _ O _ E → GLOBE (L/B), GROPE (R ruled out).

10. K _ O _ E → KNOLE (N ruled out), KOPEK (K/K).

Best seems “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency. Next best is “BLOKE” – uses B, L, K (all untried).

However, “BLOKE” is a valid word and uses three new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Other candidates: “GLOBE” (G/B/L), “FLOTE” (invalid), “MOXIE” (X low). I’ll go with “BLOKE”.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, L, O, K, E. O and E are in correct positions. B, L, K are all new letters. This seems optimal.

However, let me sanity-check if there’s a better word with more common letters. 

Another candidate: “TOWEL” – but it has L in position 5 which is incorrect (must be E). 

“TROPE” – R ruled out.

“TOILE” – I is new, L is new, T is new. This is better: T, O, I, L, E. All letters fit pattern _ _ O _ E and none are ruled out except O/E which are correct.

Yes, “TOILE” is a valid word and uses T, I, L which are all high-frequency untried letters. This seems superior to “BLOKE”.

Hence, the next guess will be TOILE.

Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Fixed positions
- Position 5 = E (✓ on all three guesses)
- Position 3 ≠ O (because in TOILE, the O moved from position 3 and was marked “-” instead of “✓”)

Ruled-out letters (x positions)
A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I

Ruled-out positions for still-in-play letters
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (and obviously not 5)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4

Therefore the pattern is:
_ _ _ _ E (position 5 is E)
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4
L must appear somewhere not position 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 3)

None of: A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I can appear.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y (and we already know O and L must appear).

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains both O and L (with O not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters

Good candidates:
C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, O, L, E

Let’s construct:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: same (but cannot be O, and cannot be L if L is forced into position 1 or 2)
- Position 4: must be either O or L (but L cannot be in position 4)
- Therefore position 4 must be O, and L must be in positions 1 or 2.

So pattern: L _ _ O E   or   _ L _ O E   or   _ _ L O E (but L in 3 and O in 4 is allowed)

Valid words:
FLOOE – invalid (double O)
GLOVE – V is allowed, G and V not ruled out, fits L _ O _ E (but we need O in position 4)
CLOVE – invalid (V in 5th, but we need E)
GLOBE – B not ruled out, pattern: G L O B E (but we have O in position 3 which is ruled out for O)
BLOKE – B not ruled out, but we need E at end
WOOZE – invalid letters and doubles

Let’s try D L O W E – DLOWE not valid
F O L L E – FOLLE not valid

M O L L E – MOLLE exists (a type of leather) but double letters might be less informative
C O U L E – not standard

Wait, let’s systematically try L _ _ O E:
L O _ O E – LOO_E – LOOPE (P ruled out), LOOKE (K allowed)

LOOKE seems valid and uses L, O, K, E, with new K. This fits:
L O O K E → positions 1: L 2: O 3: O 4: K 5: E
But double O is ok.

However we want O and L both present. LOOKE has O in positions 2 and 3. Only one O is needed.

Instead let’s try:
C O L L E – COLLE not standard
D O L C E – DOLCE is valid! D, O, L, C, E. Meets all constraints:
- Ends in E
- Contains O and L
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

DOLCE seems optimal.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, L, O, K, E. O and E are in correct positions. B, L, K are all new letters. This seems optimal.

However, let me sanity-check if there’s a better word with more common letters. 

Another candidate: “TOWEL” – but it has L in position 5 which is incorrect (must be E). 

“TROPE” – R ruled out.

“TOILE” – I is new, L is new, T is new. This is better: T, O, I, L, E. All letters fit pattern _ _ O _ E and none are ruled out except O/E which are correct.

Yes, “TOILE” is a valid word and uses T, I, L which are all high-frequency untried letters. This seems superior to “BLOKE”.

Hence, the next guess will be TOILE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: TOILE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Fixed positions
- Position 5 = E (✓ on all three guesses)
- Position 3 ≠ O (because in TOILE, the O moved from position 3 and was marked “-” instead of “✓”)

Ruled-out letters (x positions)
A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I

Ruled-out positions for still-in-play letters
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (and obviously not 5)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4

Therefore the pattern is:
_ _ _ _ E (position 5 is E)
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4
L must appear somewhere not position 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 3)

None of: A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I can appear.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y (and we already know O and L must appear).

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains both O and L (with O not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters

Good candidates:
C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, O, L, E

Let’s construct:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: same (but cannot be O, and cannot be L if L is forced into position 1 or 2)
- Position 4: must be either O or L (but L cannot be in position 4)
- Therefore position 4 must be O, and L must be in positions 1 or 2.

So pattern: L _ _ O E   or   _ L _ O E   or   _ _ L O E (but L in 3 and O in 4 is allowed)

Valid words:
FLOOE – invalid (double O)
GLOVE – V is allowed, G and V not ruled out, fits L _ O _ E (but we need O in position 4)
CLOVE – invalid (V in 5th, but we need E)
GLOBE – B not ruled out, pattern: G L O B E (but we have O in position 3 which is ruled out for O)
BLOKE – B not ruled out, but we need E at end
WOOZE – invalid letters and doubles

Let’s try D L O W E – DLOWE not valid
F O L L E – FOLLE not valid

M O L L E – MOLLE exists (a type of leather) but double letters might be less informative
C O U L E – not standard

Wait, let’s systematically try L _ _ O E:
L O _ O E – LOO_E – LOOPE (P ruled out), LOOKE (K allowed)

LOOKE seems valid and uses L, O, K, E, with new K. This fits:
L O O K E → positions 1: L 2: O 3: O 4: K 5: E
But double O is ok.

However we want O and L both present. LOOKE has O in positions 2 and 3. Only one O is needed.

Instead let’s try:
C O L L E – COLLE not standard
D O L C E – DOLCE is valid! D, O, L, C, E. Meets all constraints:
- Ends in E
- Contains O and L
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

DOLCE seems optimal.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any, to get as much information as possible. 

Looking at 5-letter words that use these common letters, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all among the top 10 most common letters. This should give good coverage for initial feedback.

Alternative good starting words could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly balanced in terms of consonant/vowel distribution and letter frequency.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – correct position (3rd letter)
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – correct position (5th letter)

So the secret word has:
- the 3rd letter is O
- the 5th letter is E
- the letters A, R, S are not present
- we still need to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 4th letters

We know nothing about the remaining letters yet. The most common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, M, P. Vowels left to consider are I and U (A and O are taken, E is fixed at the end).

A good next guess would incorporate many of these remaining high-frequency letters while keeping O in position 3 and E in position 5. The word ""POINT"" would be strong, but it re-uses the letter T which we don’t know yet. Instead, let’s try ""MOUTH"" – it uses M, U, T, H along with the known O and E positions.

However, ""MOUTH"" has O in position 2, which we know is wrong (O must be position 3). So let’s adjust.

We need a word with the pattern _ _ O _ E. Common letters to test are T, N, L, C, M, P, U, I. ""CHONE"" uses C and H but is less common. ""PHONE"" is better but P and H are moderate frequency. ""TONER"" uses T, N but R is already eliminated.

Wait – R is eliminated, so ""TONER"" is bad (has R). ""TONEY"" is not a valid word. ""POISE"" is invalid (S is eliminated). ""VOICE"" is invalid (S eliminated).

Let’s try ""CLOVE"" – C, L, V are all reasonable, and it fits _ _ O _ E. But V is lower frequency. ""DOWNE"" uses D, W, N – not great. ""GLOVE"" uses G, L, V – G is low.

Better choice: ""OZONE"" – but that repeats O, and Z is low frequency. ""WOKE"" is 4 letters.

Best seems ""CLOVE"" or ""PHONE"". Between these, ""PHONE"" uses P, H, O, N, E – P and N are common, H is moderate. It’s a valid word and fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Hence, the next guess will be PHONE.

Remaining high-frequency letters to test: T, L, C, M, D, I, U, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

We want a word that fills positions 1, 2 and 4 with letters not yet tried. A strong next guess would use several new common letters. One good candidate is “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency and L/O/C are still possible. However we know O and E positions already.

2. L _ O _ E → LOUIE (invalid spelling?), LONGE (valid but obscure), LOPE (4 letters).

3. C _ O _ E → CLOVE (V is low), COMBE (M/B used yet), etc.

4. D _ O _ E → DOWSE (S ruled out), DOMED (second D is in position 4), DOZER (Z low).

5. M _ O _ E → MONDE (N ruled out), MOVIE (V low).

6. F _ O _ E → FLOTE (not a word), FORCE (R ruled out).

7. B _ O _ E → BLOKE (L/K), BROKE (R ruled out).

8. W _ O _ E → WOOZE (Z low), WOMBE (not valid).

9. G _ O _ E → GLOBE (L/B), GROPE (R ruled out).

10. K _ O _ E → KNOLE (N ruled out), KOPEK (K/K).

Best seems “CLOVE” but V is low-frequency. Next best is “BLOKE” – uses B, L, K (all untried).

However, “BLOKE” is a valid word and uses three new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Other candidates: “GLOBE” (G/B/L), “FLOTE” (invalid), “MOXIE” (X low). I’ll go with “BLOKE”.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, L, O, K, E. O and E are in correct positions. B, L, K are all new letters. This seems optimal.

However, let me sanity-check if there’s a better word with more common letters. 

Another candidate: “TOWEL” – but it has L in position 5 which is incorrect (must be E). 

“TROPE” – R ruled out.

“TOILE” – I is new, L is new, T is new. This is better: T, O, I, L, E. All letters fit pattern _ _ O _ E and none are ruled out except O/E which are correct.

Yes, “TOILE” is a valid word and uses T, I, L which are all high-frequency untried letters. This seems superior to “BLOKE”.

Hence, the next guess will be TOILE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: TOILE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Fixed positions
- Position 5 = E (✓ on all three guesses)
- Position 3 ≠ O (because in TOILE, the O moved from position 3 and was marked “-” instead of “✓”)

Ruled-out letters (x positions)
A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I

Ruled-out positions for still-in-play letters
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (and obviously not 5)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4

Therefore the pattern is:
_ _ _ _ E (position 5 is E)
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4
L must appear somewhere not position 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 3)

None of: A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I can appear.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y (and we already know O and L must appear).

We need a valid 5-letter word that satisfies:
- Ends in E
- Contains both O and L (with O not in position 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters

Good candidates:
C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, O, L, E

Let’s construct:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: same (but cannot be O, and cannot be L if L is forced into position 1 or 2)
- Position 4: must be either O or L (but L cannot be in position 4)
- Therefore position 4 must be O, and L must be in positions 1 or 2.

So pattern: L _ _ O E   or   _ L _ O E   or   _ _ L O E (but L in 3 and O in 4 is allowed)

Valid words:
FLOOE – invalid (double O)
GLOVE – V is allowed, G and V not ruled out, fits L _ O _ E (but we need O in position 4)
CLOVE – invalid (V in 5th, but we need E)
GLOBE – B not ruled out, pattern: G L O B E (but we have O in position 3 which is ruled out for O)
BLOKE – B not ruled out, but we need E at end
WOOZE – invalid letters and doubles

Let’s try D L O W E – DLOWE not valid
F O L L E – FOLLE not valid

M O L L E – MOLLE exists (a type of leather) but double letters might be less informative
C O U L E – not standard

Wait, let’s systematically try L _ _ O E:
L O _ O E – LOO_E – LOOPE (P ruled out), LOOKE (K allowed)

LOOKE seems valid and uses L, O, K, E, with new K. This fits:
L O O K E → positions 1: L 2: O 3: O 4: K 5: E
But double O is ok.

However we want O and L both present. LOOKE has O in positions 2 and 3. Only one O is needed.

Instead let’s try:
C O L L E – COLLE not standard
D O L C E – DOLCE is valid! D, O, L, C, E. Meets all constraints:
- Ends in E
- Contains O and L
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 3 (allowed)
- No ruled-out letters

DOLCE seems optimal.

Fixed positions
- Position 5 = E (✓ on all four guesses)

Letters ruled out completely (x)
A, R, S, P, H, N, T, I, D, C

Letters confirmed in the word but not yet positioned (-)
- O (was in position 3 in AROSE/PHONE, then moved to position 2 in TOILE, position 2 in DOLCE, so it must be in position 1 or 4)
- L (was in position 4 in TOILE, position 3 in DOLCE, so it must be in position 1 or 2)

Current pattern possibilities
- O is in position 1 or 4
- L is in position 1 or 2
- Position 5 is E
- No other letters can be: A,R,S,P,H,N,T,I,D,C

Remaining usable letters (not yet ruled out)
B, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y (plus O and L which we know must appear)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Contains both O and L (with constraints above)
3. Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns:
1. O _ _ _ E (O in position 1) and L must be in position 2
   → O L _ _ E
   Need a valid word: OL _ _ E
   Possible: OLIVE (I ruled out), OLLIE (double L, I ruled out), OLMEC (C ruled out)
   → OLIVE has I (x), OLLIE has I (x), OLMEC has C (x)

2. _ _ _ O E (O in position 4) and L must be in position 1 or 2
   → L _ _ O E or _ L _ O E

   L _ _ O E:
   - L O _ O E - LOO_E → LOOKE (K allowed) but double O
   - L U _ O E → LUPOE (invalid)
   - L F _ O E → L F _ O E - no valid word

   _ L _ O E:
   - B L _ O E → BLOKE (K allowed) but K is allowed
   - F L _ O E → FLO_E → FLORE (R ruled out), FLOBE (invalid)
   - G L _ O E → GLOBE (B allowed, R ruled out in globe? Wait GLOBE has R which is ruled out)
   - M L _ O E → MLO_E - no valid word
   - V L _ O E → invalid
   - K L _ O E → invalid
   - U L _ O E → invalid
   - W L _ O E → invalid

   The best candidate is BLOKE - let's check:
   - B: not ruled out
   - L: allowed in position 2
   - O: allowed in position 4
   - K: not ruled out
   - E: correct position 5
   - No ruled-out letters
   - Valid English word

Therefore, BLOKE is the optimal next guess.
