For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, N, R, L are good choices. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 different letters
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us good coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with AROSE as my first guess since it's a well-established strong opener.

All 5 letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Since we’ve now eliminated A, R, O, S, E, we need a 5-letter word that uses none of these letters and still gives good information.

We still have lots of consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U) available.  
A common high-information choice that avoids A, R, O, S, E is “UNITY”.  
It contains:
- three new vowels: U, I, Y (Y can act like a vowel)

From the new feedback:

- U(-) – the letter U is in the word but in the wrong place.

- I(✓) – I is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:

1. Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T
2. Letters fixed: I (position 3), Y (position 5)
3. Letter in word but not position 2: U

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ I _ Y that uses U somewhere (but not in position 2) and avoids all eliminated letters.

Possible consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Possible vowels still allowed: I (already used), U (must appear), sometimes Y (already used).

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: any remaining consonant
- Position 2: must be U (only vowel we can use there that’s still available)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: any remaining consonant
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Thus the word is structured: C U I C Y.

A valid English word matching that pattern is “QUICK” (Q is still allowed, K is still allowed).

Let’s check:
- Q – not eliminated
- U – in word, fits position 2
- I – position 3, correct
- C – not eliminated
- K – not eliminated
- Avoids all eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T

Current confirmed information:
- Position 3: I (✓)  
- Position 2: U (✓)  
- Position 4: C (✓)  
- Position 5: Y (✓)  

So the word looks like: _ U I C Y  

Letters already ruled out:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Q, K  

Letters still allowed in position 1: any consonant not yet eliminated (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, V, W, X, Z).  

A 5-letter English word fitting “? U I C Y” is “JUICE” (but J is still allowed).  
Wait: J U I C Y → JUICY. That’s a valid word and fits _ U I C Y.

Let’s double-check:
- J not eliminated
- U confirmed in position 2
- I confirmed in position 3
- C confirmed in position 4
- Y confirmed in position 5

No banned letters are used.
