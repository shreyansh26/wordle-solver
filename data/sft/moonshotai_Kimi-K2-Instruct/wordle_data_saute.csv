For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information. The best starting words typically contain:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) to test their presence
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers very common letters in strategic positions and gives good information about both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.

So far the pattern is: S _ _ T E  
The missing letters must be in positions 2 and 3, and the word must contain the letter A (from the ""-"" feedback on position 3).

Possible candidates:
- SATTE – invalid (double T)
- SANTE – word? Yes, but less common
- SALTE – L was already x'd out
- SWARE – A fits in position 3, but feedback said A is wrong position 3
- SHATE – H not strongly indicated
- S A _ T E with A not in position 3 → A must be in position 2
  That forces A into position 2: S A _ T E
  Then position 3 can be any consonant except L, and must form a valid word.

Valid words fitting S A _ T E:
- SANTE – exists but uncommon
- SARTE – uncommon, no
- SAUTE – yes, a common word
