For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (especially vowels and consonants like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Historically performs well as a starting point

Some strong first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (similar rationale)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)
- STARE
- AROSE

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a well-balanced word that includes three very common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding repeats.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with N.
2. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
3. Does not contain C, R, or A.

We have 4 remaining positions, and we need to fill them avoiding C, R, A. We should also try a new set of letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use frequent consonants and vowels we haven’t used yet.

Letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels not yet used: I, O, U

Let’s try a word like ""DOZEN"":
- D: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- Z: less common but good to test
- E: known to be in word
- N: known in last position

Wait, feedback says E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be elsewhere. CRANE had E in 5th, so in new guess, E should be in 1-4.

Another good word: ""STONE""
- S, T: common consonants
- O: new vowel
- N: in correct position
- E: in word (but was in 5th last time, now in 4th)

But N is fixed at 5th, so ""STON E"" is invalid. Wait, N is already in 5th. So structure is: _ _ _ _ N.

Better word: ""THINE""
- T, H: new consonants
- I: new vowel
- N: correct position
- E: known in word (now in 4th)

But E was in 5th in CRANE, now moving to 4th. This is acceptable.

Another option: ""ELDON"" – but O is in 4th, N in 5th, E in 1st. But this has L and D, which are good to test.

But let’s pick a word that focuses on new letters and positions E well. ""STONE"" is not possible because N is fixed at 5th, and E needs to move. 

How about ""ELDON"":
- E: 1st (new position)
- L: new
- D: new
- O: new
- N: fixed at 5th

But A is already excluded, and we have E, N. Let's try ""ELDON"".

But is ""ELDON"" a valid 5-letter word? It seems like a name, not a common word. Better to choose a common word.

- H, O, Y: new letters

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is definitely in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4.

From Guess 2 (HONEY):
- H, O, Y are not in the word.
- N appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. We already knew N must be in position 5, so this just reiterates that.
- E appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E must be in positions 1-3.

So far we have:
- Word ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, H, O, Y.

We need a word that is 5 letters, ends with N, has E in one of the first three positions, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (though not all are equally common).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Ends with N.
2. Has E early.
3. Uses new common consonants to gain more info.

Good candidates:
- “BEGIN” – but G, I are new, and it uses E in 2nd position. Check if B, E, G, I, N fit all constraints: yes.
- “LEVEN” – has E twice, but we already know E is in word, and this would test positions. But it might not be optimal.
- “TWEEN” – but W is new, but double E might not help much.

“BEGIN” seems strong: B, E, G, I, N. All new letters except N and E, and it places E in position 2.

Let’s check:
- B: new.
- E: known, now in position 2.
- G: new.
- I: new.
- N: fixed at 5.

This seems optimal for maximizing new letter information while respecting known constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (especially vowels and consonants like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Historically performs well as a starting point

Some strong first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (similar rationale)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)
- STARE
- AROSE

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a well-balanced word that includes three very common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding repeats.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with N.
2. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
3. Does not contain C, R, or A.

We have 4 remaining positions, and we need to fill them avoiding C, R, A. We should also try a new set of letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use frequent consonants and vowels we haven’t used yet.

Letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels not yet used: I, O, U

Let’s try a word like ""DOZEN"":
- D: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- Z: less common but good to test
- E: known to be in word
- N: known in last position

Wait, feedback says E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be elsewhere. CRANE had E in 5th, so in new guess, E should be in 1-4.

Another good word: ""STONE""
- S, T: common consonants
- O: new vowel
- N: in correct position
- E: in word (but was in 5th last time, now in 4th)

But N is fixed at 5th, so ""STON E"" is invalid. Wait, N is already in 5th. So structure is: _ _ _ _ N.

Better word: ""THINE""
- T, H: new consonants
- I: new vowel
- N: correct position
- E: known in word (now in 4th)

But E was in 5th in CRANE, now moving to 4th. This is acceptable.

Another option: ""ELDON"" – but O is in 4th, N in 5th, E in 1st. But this has L and D, which are good to test.

But let’s pick a word that focuses on new letters and positions E well. ""STONE"" is not possible because N is fixed at 5th, and E needs to move. 

How about ""ELDON"":
- E: 1st (new position)
- L: new
- D: new
- O: new
- N: fixed at 5th

But A is already excluded, and we have E, N. Let's try ""ELDON"".

But is ""ELDON"" a valid 5-letter word? It seems like a name, not a common word. Better to choose a common word.

Another good option: ""HONEY"":
- H, O, Y: new letters
- N: 5th
- E: 4th (new position for E)

This seems good: H (new), O (new), N (fixed), E (new position), Y (new).

Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(-) Y(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is definitely in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4.

From Guess 2 (HONEY):
- H, O, Y are not in the word.
- N appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. We already knew N must be in position 5, so this just reiterates that.
- E appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E must be in positions 1-3.

So far we have:
- Word ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, H, O, Y.

We need a word that is 5 letters, ends with N, has E in one of the first three positions, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (though not all are equally common).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Ends with N.
2. Has E early.
3. Uses new common consonants to gain more info.

Good candidates:
- “BEGIN” – but G, I are new, and it uses E in 2nd position. Check if B, E, G, I, N fit all constraints: yes.
- “LEVEN” – has E twice, but we already know E is in word, and this would test positions. But it might not be optimal.
- “TWEEN” – but W is new, but double E might not help much.

“BEGIN” seems strong: B, E, G, I, N. All new letters except N and E, and it places E in position 2.

Let’s check:
- B: new.
- E: known, now in position 2.
- G: new.
- I: new.
- N: fixed at 5.

This seems optimal for maximizing new letter information while respecting known constraints.

Let’s extract every constraint revealed so far:

1. N is in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
   (From BEGIN it was in position 2 and got “-”; from HONEY in 4 and got “-”; CRANE had it in 5 and got “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 1.
3. Letters we now know are **not** in the word:  
   C, R, A, H, O, Y, B, G, I.

So the pattern is:
E _ _ _ N

We need three more letters, none of which are any of the excluded ones, and no repeats.

Allowed remaining consonants: D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: none left (only E is allowed and is already used once).

We want a common word that fits E _ _ _ N.  
Likely candidates:

- ELFIN (but I is excluded)  
- ELVEN (E twice, V allowed) – but is it common?  
- EXEUN – not a word  
- ELDEN – D allowed, but again is it common?  
- EMMEN – M allowed, but double M?  
- EVENS – V, S allowed, and it’s a known word  
- ESKEN – S, K allowed, though not common  
- EDENN – double N, invalid  

“EVENS” is a real, common 5-letter word that fits:
E V E N S → pattern E _ _ _ N  
But it has two Es. We know E is in the word, but we don’t know how many times. It’s acceptable to test.

Another that avoids double-E: “EDMUN” – but U is allowed and M, D are allowed. However, “EDMUN” is more of a name.

“EVENS” is the safest common word.

Let me choose “EVENS”.

But wait, N already must be in position 5; in EVENS the N is in position 4, so that’s impossible. I need N in position 5 explicitly.

So the word must be E _ _ _ N.

We need three consonants in positions 2-4, none of which are excluded, forming a valid word.

Possible real words fitting E _ _ _ N:
- EXULT – but ends with T, not N  
- ELFIN – I excluded  
- ELKEN – K allowed, but is it a word?  
- ELVEN – V allowed, ends with N  
- EMME N – double M, ends with N but invalid  
- ESKEN – K, S allowed, ends with N, but not common  
- EDMUN – not a word  

The best common word fitting E _ _ _ N is “ELVEN” (though somewhat fantasy).  
Another is “EXMEN” – not a word.  
Actually “EATEN” has A excluded, “EATON” not a word.  
“ENTER” ends with R, not N.  

Re-examining common 5-letter words ending in N starting with E:
- ELVEN  (valid, albeit fantasy term)  
- EOSIN  (chemistry term)  
- EMYUN – no  

“ELVEN” is the closest real word fitting. Let’s use it.

Letters: E, L, V, E, N.  
E is allowed (already known), L, V are new consonants, N is fixed.  
It tests L and V while confirming E in position 1.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (though not all are equally common).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Ends with N.
2. Has E early.
3. Uses new common consonants to gain more info.

Good candidates:
- “BEGIN” – but G, I are new, and it uses E in 2nd position. Check if B, E, G, I, N fit all constraints: yes.
- “LEVEN” – has E twice, but we already know E is in word, and this would test positions. But it might not be optimal.
- “TWEEN” – but W is new, but double E might not help much.

“BEGIN” seems strong: B, E, G, I, N. All new letters except N and E, and it places E in position 2.

Let’s check:
- B: new.
- E: known, now in position 2.
- G: new.
- I: new.
- N: fixed at 5.

This seems optimal for maximizing new letter information while respecting known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(-) Y(-)
Guess 3: BEGIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) G(-) I(-) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract every constraint revealed so far:

1. N is in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
   (From BEGIN it was in position 2 and got “-”; from HONEY in 4 and got “-”; CRANE had it in 5 and got “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 1.
3. Letters we now know are **not** in the word:  
   C, R, A, H, O, Y, B, G, I.

So the pattern is:
E _ _ _ N

We need three more letters, none of which are any of the excluded ones, and no repeats.

Allowed remaining consonants: D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: none left (only E is allowed and is already used once).

We want a common word that fits E _ _ _ N.  
Likely candidates:

- ELFIN (but I is excluded)  
- ELVEN (E twice, V allowed) – but is it common?  
- EXEUN – not a word  
- ELDEN – D allowed, but again is it common?  
- EMMEN – M allowed, but double M?  
- EVENS – V, S allowed, and it’s a known word  
- ESKEN – S, K allowed, though not common  
- EDENN – double N, invalid  

“EVENS” is a real, common 5-letter word that fits:
E V E N S → pattern E _ _ _ N  
But it has two Es. We know E is in the word, but we don’t know how many times. It’s acceptable to test.

Another that avoids double-E: “EDMUN” – but U is allowed and M, D are allowed. However, “EDMUN” is more of a name.

“EVENS” is the safest common word.

Let me choose “EVENS”.

But wait, N already must be in position 5; in EVENS the N is in position 4, so that’s impossible. I need N in position 5 explicitly.

So the word must be E _ _ _ N.

We need three consonants in positions 2-4, none of which are excluded, forming a valid word.

Possible real words fitting E _ _ _ N:
- EXULT – but ends with T, not N  
- ELFIN – I excluded  
- ELKEN – K allowed, but is it a word?  
- ELVEN – V allowed, ends with N  
- EMME N – double M, ends with N but invalid  
- ESKEN – K, S allowed, ends with N, but not common  
- EDMUN – not a word  

The best common word fitting E _ _ _ N is “ELVEN” (though somewhat fantasy).  
Another is “EXMEN” – not a word.  
Actually “EATEN” has A excluded, “EATON” not a word.  
“ENTER” ends with R, not N.  

Re-examining common 5-letter words ending in N starting with E:
- ELVEN  (valid, albeit fantasy term)  
- EOSIN  (chemistry term)  
- EMYUN – no  

“ELVEN” is the closest real word fitting. Let’s use it.

Letters: E, L, V, E, N.  
E is allowed (already known), L, V are new consonants, N is fixed.  
It tests L and V while confirming E in position 1.

Hence: ELVEN

   Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""EMDEN"" (E M D E N) – but E already in position 1, can't have E again unless it's allowed to repeat. The feedback only tells us E is in position 1, doesn't forbid repeats.

   But ELVEN had double-E and second E got ""-"", meaning E can't be in positions 2-5, so E can only be in position 1, and can't repeat. So E must appear exactly once.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (especially vowels and consonants like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Historically performs well as a starting point

Some strong first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (similar rationale)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)
- STARE
- AROSE

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a well-balanced word that includes three very common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding repeats.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so E must be in one of positions 1-4.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with N.
2. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
3. Does not contain C, R, or A.

We have 4 remaining positions, and we need to fill them avoiding C, R, A. We should also try a new set of letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use frequent consonants and vowels we haven’t used yet.

Letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels not yet used: I, O, U

Let’s try a word like ""DOZEN"":
- D: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- Z: less common but good to test
- E: known to be in word
- N: known in last position

Wait, feedback says E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be elsewhere. CRANE had E in 5th, so in new guess, E should be in 1-4.

Another good word: ""STONE""
- S, T: common consonants
- O: new vowel
- N: in correct position
- E: in word (but was in 5th last time, now in 4th)

But N is fixed at 5th, so ""STON E"" is invalid. Wait, N is already in 5th. So structure is: _ _ _ _ N.

Better word: ""THINE""
- T, H: new consonants
- I: new vowel
- N: correct position
- E: known in word (now in 4th)

But E was in 5th in CRANE, now moving to 4th. This is acceptable.

Another option: ""ELDON"" – but O is in 4th, N in 5th, E in 1st. But this has L and D, which are good to test.

But let’s pick a word that focuses on new letters and positions E well. ""STONE"" is not possible because N is fixed at 5th, and E needs to move. 

How about ""ELDON"":
- E: 1st (new position)
- L: new
- D: new
- O: new
- N: fixed at 5th

But A is already excluded, and we have E, N. Let's try ""ELDON"".

But is ""ELDON"" a valid 5-letter word? It seems like a name, not a common word. Better to choose a common word.

Another good option: ""HONEY"":
- H, O, Y: new letters

Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(-) Y(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is definitely in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4.

From Guess 2 (HONEY):
- H, O, Y are not in the word.
- N appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. We already knew N must be in position 5, so this just reiterates that.
- E appears in position 4 and received “-”, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E must be in positions 1-3.

So far we have:
- Word ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, H, O, Y.

We need a word that is 5 letters, ends with N, has E in one of the first three positions, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z (though not all are equally common).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Ends with N.
2. Has E early.
3. Uses new common consonants to gain more info.

Good candidates:
- “BEGIN” – but G, I are new, and it uses E in 2nd position. Check if B, E, G, I, N fit all constraints: yes.
- “LEVEN” – has E twice, but we already know E is in word, and this would test positions. But it might not be optimal.
- “TWEEN” – but W is new, but double E might not help much.

“BEGIN” seems strong: B, E, G, I, N. All new letters except N and E, and it places E in position 2.

Let’s check:
- B: new.
- E: known, now in position 2.
- G: new.
- I: new.
- N: fixed at 5.

This seems optimal for maximizing new letter information while respecting known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(-) Y(-)
Guess 3: BEGIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) G(-) I(-) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract every constraint revealed so far:

1. N is in the word and must be the last letter (position 5).
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
   (From BEGIN it was in position 2 and got “-”; from HONEY in 4 and got “-”; CRANE had it in 5 and got “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 1.
3. Letters we now know are **not** in the word:  
   C, R, A, H, O, Y, B, G, I.

So the pattern is:
E _ _ _ N

We need three more letters, none of which are any of the excluded ones, and no repeats.

Allowed remaining consonants: D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: none left (only E is allowed and is already used once).

We want a common word that fits E _ _ _ N.  
Likely candidates:

- ELFIN (but I is excluded)  
- ELVEN (E twice, V allowed) – but is it common?  
- EXEUN – not a word  
- ELDEN – D allowed, but again is it common?  
- EMMEN – M allowed, but double M?  
- EVENS – V, S allowed, and it’s a known word  
- ESKEN – S, K allowed, though not common  
- EDENN – double N, invalid  

“EVENS” is a real, common 5-letter word that fits:
E V E N S → pattern E _ _ _ N  
But it has two Es. We know E is in the word, but we don’t know how many times. It’s acceptable to test.

Another that avoids double-E: “EDMUN” – but U is allowed and M, D are allowed. However, “EDMUN” is more of a name.

“EVENS” is the safest common word.

Let me choose “EVENS”.

But wait, N already must be in position 5; in EVENS the N is in position 4, so that’s impossible. I need N in position 5 explicitly.

So the word must be E _ _ _ N.

We need three consonants in positions 2-4, none of which are excluded, forming a valid word.

Possible real words fitting E _ _ _ N:
- EXULT – but ends with T, not N  
- ELFIN – I excluded  
- ELKEN – K allowed, but is it a word?  
- ELVEN – V allowed, ends with N  
- EMME N – double M, ends with N but invalid  
- ESKEN – K, S allowed, ends with N, but not common  
- EDMUN – not a word  

The best common word fitting E _ _ _ N is “ELVEN” (though somewhat fantasy).  
Another is “EXMEN” – not a word.  
Actually “EATEN” has A excluded, “EATON” not a word.  
“ENTER” ends with R, not N.  

Re-examining common 5-letter words ending in N starting with E:
- ELVEN  (valid, albeit fantasy term)  
- EOSIN  (chemistry term)  
- EMYUN – no  

“ELVEN” is the closest real word fitting. Let’s use it.

Letters: E, L, V, E, N.  
E is allowed (already known), L, V are new consonants, N is fixed.  
It tests L and V while confirming E in position 1.

Hence: ELVEN

2. Current known pattern: E _ _ _ N

3. Need three new letters for positions 2-4 from remaining alphabet:
   Allowed consonants: D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Z
   Allowed vowels: none (only E is in word and already used in position 1)

4. Looking for common 5-letter words beginning with E and ending with N:
   - ESKEN (S, K new) – uncommon
   - EMME N – invalid
   - EXMEN – invalid
   - EDMUN – invalid
   - EXEUN – invalid
   - EDSEN – invalid

   Best common word: ESKEN (though rare), but let's check EPENN – invalid.

   Actually, checking more common words:
   - EXEON – invalid
   - EMMEN – invalid
   - EDSEN – invalid

   The only valid word fitting is ESKEN (even if uncommon), or maybe EDSEN (not a word).

   Another approach: E T W E N – invalid.

   Realizing I missed some common words:
   - EATEN – A excluded
   - EATON – invalid

   Actually, the correct common word is ESKEN (a variant spelling of ""eskin""), but let's use ESKEN.

   Alternatively, ESKEN is the only valid one. Let me use ESKEN.

   But is ESKEN a valid word? It's rare. Another option: EDMUN – invalid.

   Realizing I missed an important one:
   - EMMEN – no
   - ESKEN – no
   - EDMUN – no

   Actually, the correct valid common word is ESKEN (a surname), but it's not standard.

   Another realization: I missed ""EMMEN"" is invalid.

   Actually, the valid and common word is ""EMDEN"" (a city), but D is allowed, M is allowed, E already used.

   Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""EMDEN"" (E M D E N) – but E already in position 1, can't have E again unless it's allowed to repeat. The feedback only tells us E is in position 1, doesn't forbid repeats.

   But ELVEN had double-E and second E got ""-"", meaning E can't be in positions 2-5, so E can only be in position 1, and can't repeat. So E must appear exactly once.

   Therefore, positions 2-4 must be consonants from remaining: D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Z.

   Common 5-letter words beginning with E and ending with N with no other vowels:
   - ESKEN (S, K)
   - EDMEN (D, M)
   - EFTEN (F, T)
   - EMBON (M, B but B excluded)
   - ELPEN – L excluded
   - EFTEN – F, T new
   - ESKEN – S, K new

   EFTEN seems better.The confirmed pattern is E _ _ _ N with:
- E only in position 1
- N only in position 5
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, H, O, Y, B, G, I, L, V

A valid common word fitting E _ _ _ N using new consonants is ""EFTEN"" (positions 2-4: F, T, E is not allowed again).
