Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Some effective starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- AUDIO
- AROSE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and will help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Current known information:
- S is correct in position 1
- A is correct in position 3
- T exists somewhere in the word but not in position 4
- L and E are NOT in the word at all

So far the pattern is:
S _ A _ _

Letters still possible for positions 2 and 5: every letter except L and E.

Letters possible for position 4: every letter except T, L, E.

We also know T must appear somewhere, so it could be in position 2 or 5 (since position 4 is already ruled out).

Let me think of common 5-letter words that start with S, have A in the middle, and contain T. Some candidates:
- SATIN would conflict because T would be in position 4
- STARS - but would have T in position 2 and S in position 5
- STAIN - T in position 2, possible
- STAMP - M is allowed, but P is allowed
- STAND - N and D are allowed
- STARK - R and K are allowed
- START - T appears twice but position 4 is already invalid for T

I think ""STAIN"" is a good next guess because:
- Starts with S (✓ position 1)
- Has A in position 3 (✓)
- Puts T in position 2 (which is allowed since T can't be in position 4)
- Uses common letters I and N which haven't been ruled out

Only the last letter is unknown.  
We know the remaining letter cannot be L, E, N, or R.  
Also, every other letter of the alphabet is still possible except those four and any already present (S, T, A, I).

Looking at common 5-letter words that start with “STAI” besides STAIR and STAIN:

STAIM – not a real word  
STAID – D is possible, but “STAID” already has D in position 5  
STAIF – not a real word  
STAIL – L is ruled out  
STAIG – G is possible, but “STAIG” is rare/Scots spelling

The only reasonable English word left is “STAID”, with D in position 5. Since D has not been ruled out, this must be the answer.
