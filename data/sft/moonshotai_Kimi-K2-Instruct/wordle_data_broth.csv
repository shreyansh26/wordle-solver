Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good opening guess should contain common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

I'll choose a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters while avoiding less common ones. A popular strategy is to use a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

""SLATE"" is a particularly good choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters in strategic positions.

The feedback from SLATE tells us:

- T is in the word and in the correct position (T is in the 4th spot)

Guess 2: MOUNT  
M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)

- M, U, N are NOT in the word (x).  
- T and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

From the first guess we already knew:
- Word pattern _ _ _ T _ (T in 4th spot was ✓).  
Now we see T is marked (–) instead of ✓, which is impossible unless our interpretation was off. Actually, the feedback system uses the same symbols for each guess independently.  
So for MOUNT:
  - T must be in the word, but not in position 5 (because it’s –).
  - O must be in the word, but not in position 2 (because it’s –).

Therefore the true word has:
- T in position 4 (from SLATE feedback)  
- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5) BUT NOT position 2  
- No S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Let's carefully parse the feedback so far.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):  
S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
- T is in the word **and** in the **correct position 4**.  
- S, L, A, E are **not** in the word.

From Guess 2 (MOUNT):  
M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)  
- M, U, N are **not** in the word.  
- O is in the word but **wrong position** (it was in position 2).  
- T is in the word but **wrong position** (it was in position 5).  

However, this **contradicts** Guess 1, which said T is **correctly** in position 4.  
Therefore, the symbol next to T in Guess 2 should have been **✓** (re-affirming it is in position 4), not **–**.  
I believe the feedback for Guess 2 was a typo or mis-typed. I'll treat T as **still locked in position 4**, because Guess 1’s ✓ supersedes Guess 2’s –.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, C, F
- Letters **confirmed in word**: O (but **not** in position 2) and R (and it’s **correctly** in position 2 from Guess 3).

From Guess 3 (CROFT):  
C(x) R(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(-)  
- C and F are **not** in the word.  
- R is **correctly** in **position 2**.  
- O is **correctly** in **position 3**.  
(The T feedback here again shows –, but again we ignore it because T is locked in position 4 from Guess 1.)

So the pattern is now: _ R O T _

We still need the **first and fifth letters**, chosen from unused letters that are **not** in the forbidden set:  
Forbidden so far: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, C, F

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need two distinct letters from this remaining set to fill positions 1 and 5.  
Possible words:  
- DROIT  
- GROIN  
- PROXY  
- BROWN  

Let’s check each:  
- DROIT: D and I – both allowed, no conflicts.  
- GROIN: G and N – but N was already excluded (N(x) in Guess 2).  
- PROXY: P and Y – allowed.  
- BROWN: B and N – but N excluded.  

So candidates: **DROIT**, **PROXY**.

Between them, **DROIT** uses I (common vowel) and D (common consonant), fitting the pattern _ R O T _.

Thus, the next logical guess is **DROIT**.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,broth,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good opening guess should contain common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

I'll choose a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters while avoiding less common ones. A popular strategy is to use a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

""SLATE"" is a particularly good choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters in strategic positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (T is in the 4th spot)

So we now know:
- The secret word is _ _ _ T _
- The letters S, L, A, E cannot appear anywhere in the word.

We need to pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E
3. Contains new letters we haven't tried yet to maximize information

Good remaining common letters are R, O, I, N, C, U, M, P, F, H, Y, D, G, B, K, etc.

Let's try to pick a word with T in the 4th spot and some of these new letters. Some candidates that fit:
- FRUIT (but has I and U)
- POINT (but has I)
- CROUT (but has O and U)
- BRUIT (but has I and U)
- MOUNT (but has O and U)

""MOUNT"" seems good because it uses 4 new letters (M, O, U, N) plus the confirmed T, and avoids all the excluded letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the latest feedback:

Guess 2: MOUNT  
M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)

- M, U, N are NOT in the word (x).  
- T and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

From the first guess we already knew:
- Word pattern _ _ _ T _ (T in 4th spot was ✓).  
Now we see T is marked (–) instead of ✓, which is impossible unless our interpretation was off. Actually, the feedback system uses the same symbols for each guess independently.  
So for MOUNT:
  - T must be in the word, but not in position 5 (because it’s –).
  - O must be in the word, but not in position 2 (because it’s –).

Therefore the true word has:
- T in position 4 (from SLATE feedback)  
- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5) BUT NOT position 2  
- No S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tried: R, I, C, H, P, Y, D, G, B, K, F, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- T in position 4  
- O somewhere, but not position 2  
- No S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Possible positions for O:
- Position 1: O _ _ T _  
- Position 3: _ _ O T _  (but then T is position 4 and O is position 3, which is fine)  
- Position 5: _ _ _ T O

Examples that fit:
- ORBIT – but B, R, I, T all allowed and T in 4th.  
- CROFT – C, R, O, F, T: T in 4, O in 3, no forbidden letters.  
- DROPT – D, R, O, P, T: but double T is impossible.  
- GRIFT – G, R, I, F, T: fits perfectly (T in 4, no O – so invalid, missing required O).  

We must include O. Try “CROFT”:
C R O F T  
- T in position 4 (✓ from SLATE)  
- O in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 2)  
- Letters used: C, R, O, F, T – none forbidden.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's carefully parse the feedback so far.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):  
S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
- T is in the word **and** in the **correct position 4**.  
- S, L, A, E are **not** in the word.

M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)  
- M, U, N are **not** in the word.  
- O is in the word but **wrong position** (it was in position 2).  
- T is in the word but **wrong position** (it was in position 5).  

However, this **contradicts** Guess 1, which said T is **correctly** in position 4.  
Therefore, the symbol next to T in Guess 2 should have been **✓** (re-affirming it is in position 4), not **–**.  
I believe the feedback for Guess 2 was a typo or mis-typed. I'll treat T as **still locked in position 4**, because Guess 1’s ✓ supersedes Guess 2’s –.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T _
- Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, C, F
- Letters **confirmed in word**: O (but **not** in position 2) and R (and it’s **correctly** in position 2 from Guess 3).

From Guess 3 (CROFT):  
C(x) R(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(-)  
- C and F are **not** in the word.  
- R is **correctly** in **position 2**.  
- O is **correctly** in **position 3**.  
(The T feedback here again shows –, but again we ignore it because T is locked in position 4 from Guess 1.)

So the pattern is now: _ R O T _

We still need the **first and fifth letters**, chosen from unused letters that are **not** in the forbidden set:  
Forbidden so far: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, C, F

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need two distinct letters from this remaining set to fill positions 1 and 5.  
Possible words:  
- DROIT  
- GROIN  
- PROXY  
- BROWN  

Let’s check each:  
- DROIT: D and I – both allowed, no conflicts.  
- GROIN: G and N – but N was already excluded (N(x) in Guess 2).  
- PROXY: P and Y – allowed.  
- BROWN: B and N – but N excluded.  

So candidates: **DROIT**, **PROXY**.

Between them, **DROIT** uses I (common vowel) and D (common consonant), fitting the pattern _ R O T _.

Thus, the next logical guess is **DROIT**.

Let me update the accumulated knowledge after four guesses.

Current deductions:

1. Position 4 is definitely T (from SLATE’s ✓ on T).  
2. Letters **not** in the word (x’s so far):  
   S, L, A, E, M, U, N, C, F, D, I  
3. Position 2 is R (✓ in CROFT and again in DROIT).  
4. Position 3 is O (✓ in CROFT and again in DROIT).  
5. Therefore the pattern is fixed at:  
   _ R O T _

We only need one letter in position 5.  
Available letters (those never rejected and not yet placed):  
B, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, Q (and a few rarer ones).

Any 5-letter word matching: ? R O T ? where “?” is any of the available letters.

Common candidates:  
- BROTH  
- GROTT (invalid, double T)  
- PROXY (X not allowed, X never tested but is uncommon)  
- WROTE (E is rejected)  
- GROVY (rare)  
- TROTY (invalid)  
- BROSK (K is allowed)  

Best practical choices: BROTH, GROVY, PROXY (if X allowed), or direct single-letter fills.

Since we only need one letter and have many tries left, let’s simply pick the most common: **BROTH**.

But H has not been rejected yet.  

Check:  
B – allowed  
R – already ✓  
O – already ✓  
T – already ✓  
H – allowed  

So **BROTH** is valid.

(Note: feedback for T in Guess 2 and 4 is listed as “–”, but we’re ignoring that because position 4 T has ✓ from Guess 1.)
