For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gained
4. Is statistically likely to reveal useful information

Looking at letter frequency in English words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Has no repeated letters
- Has been shown to be one of the most effective starting words statistically

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word definitely contains A (but not as the first letter) and E (but not as the last letter).
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y.

A strong second-guess pattern is to move the known letters (A and E) into new positions and introduce new high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:
- ""LATED"" – uses L, T, D (common letters), puts A in position 2 and E in position 4.
- ""CLEAN"" – uses C, L, N, puts A in position 4 and E in position 2.

""LATED"" seems slightly better because it tests T and D (both common), and moves A to position 2 and E to position 4 (both new positions).

1. Letters that ARE in the secret word:

   - A (somewhere other than positions 2 or 5)  
   - E (somewhere other than positions 3 or 5)  

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:

3. Remaining available positions for A and E:

4. We still need to test additional common letters: N, I, C, U, Y, M, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gained
4. Is statistically likely to reveal useful information

Looking at letter frequency in English words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Has no repeated letters
- Has been shown to be one of the most effective starting words statistically

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word definitely contains A (but not as the first letter) and E (but not as the last letter).
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, D, U, Y.

A strong second-guess pattern is to move the known letters (A and E) into new positions and introduce new high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:
- ""LATED"" – uses L, T, D (common letters), puts A in position 2 and E in position 4.
- ""CLEAN"" – uses C, L, N, puts A in position 4 and E in position 2.

""LATED"" seems slightly better because it tests T and D (both common), and moves A to position 2 and E to position 4 (both new positions).

<guess>LATED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LATED -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:
1. Letters that ARE in the secret word:
   - L (position 1)  
   - A (somewhere other than positions 2 or 5)  
   - E (somewhere other than positions 3 or 5)  

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, T, D

3. Remaining available positions for A and E:
   - A can be in positions 3 or 4 (can’t be 1, 2, or 5)  
   - E can be in positions 2 or 4 (can’t be 3, 4, or 5)  
   For both to fit without conflict, the only overlap is position 4; but they can’t both be in 4.  
   Therefore at least one of them must share position 4 with the other filling its remaining slot.

4. We still need to test additional common letters: N, I, C, U, Y, M, etc.

A good next word:
- Keeps L in position 1 (✓).  
- Places A in position 3 (one of its allowed spots).  
- Places E in position 2 (one of its allowed spots).  
- Introduces two new high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet.

Candidate word: L E A N Y  
Letters: L(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), Y(5)  
New letters tested: N, Y (both still unknown).  
Positions of known letters match constraints.

So the next guess is LEANY.

4. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated so far.
