- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L, etc.
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- Positionally, these letters are common in many 5-letter words

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

Letters confirmed IN the word: R, O, E, T  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, S, V, N, Y  

Current confirmed placements:

Remaining known letters that still need correct placement:
- R — NOT positions 2, 3, 4  
- O — NOT positions 3, 4  
- E — NOT positions 1, 5  

So the word looks like: _ _ T _ _ with the letters {R, O, E} still to be placed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but respecting the “not-in” constraints).

Possible positions for each remaining letter:
- R: allowed in 1 or 5

- E: allowed in 2 or 4  

We also need one more letter (since we only have four distinct letters so far).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,outer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L, etc.
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- Positionally, these letters are common in many 5-letter words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from arose:
- A(x) → A is not in the secret word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: A, S
- Letters definitely included: R, O, E
- These included letters are not yet in their correct positions.

Next guess should:
1. Include R, O, E (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Place R, O, E in new positions to test their correct spots
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (since we’ve only used A,R,O,S,E so far)
4. Avoid A and S

Good candidates: “rover” (but R is still in 2nd spot), “route” (O is still 3rd), “trove” (keeps R,O,E but moves them). “trove” is strong:
- T and V are new, common letters
- R moves to position 3, O to 4, E to 5

From trove:  
T(-)  → T is in the word, but not in position 1.  
R(-)  → R is still not in position 2 or 3 (it still needs a new spot).  
O(-)  → O is still not in position 3 or 4.  
V(x)  → V is not in the word.  
E(-)  → E is still not in position 5.

Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E, T  
Letters known not to be in the word: A, S, V  

Still-untested common consonants: N, L, D, C, G, H  
Still-untested common vowels: I, U

We need to place R, O, E, T into new positions and add one new letter.  
A good choice is “entry”:
- E in position 1 (new spot)  
- N (new letter) in position 2  
- T in position 3 (new spot)  
- R in position 4 (new spot)  
- Y is a vowel-like ending that hasn’t been tried yet.

This covers all four known letters in fresh slots while introducing N and Y.

Known letters still to place: T (must be in position 2 or 3, since it’s not in 3 according to Guess 4 feedback, but Guess 3 said T is in position 3 (✓). Wait, let’s recheck:

Guess 3 (entry) gave T(✓) for position 3.  
Guess 4 (other) gave T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2.  

Therefore:
- T must be in position 3 (from Guess 3: T(✓) in 3)

- O L T E R – not valid.  
- O P T E R – “opter” not valid.

“OUTER” uses U, which is an unused vowel and fits the pattern.  

Let’s check constraints:
- U is new, not tested.  
- O(✓) in 1, T(✓) in 3, E(✓) in 4, R(✓) in 5.  
- Position 2 is U, which is allowed.

Common unused consonants: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, U (as vowel).  

Possible words fitting O _ T E R:
- O C T E R – valid (octer is archaic, but “octer” isn’t a common 5-letter word).  
- O D T E R – not a word.  
- O F T E R – “ofter” not valid.  
- O G T E R – not valid.  
- O L T E R – not valid.  
- O P T E R – “opter” not valid.  
- O U T E R – valid (“outer”).  

“OUTER” uses U, which is an unused vowel and fits the pattern.  

Let’s check constraints:
- U is new, not tested.  
- O(✓) in 1, T(✓) in 3, E(✓) in 4, R(✓) in 5.  
- Position 2 is U, which is allowed.  

Thus, the correct word must be “outer”.",Guess 5: outer -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) U(✓) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
