For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain frequently used letters. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
- Letters confirmed to be in the word but whose positions are unknown: I, L.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
- DOES contain both I and L (but we don’t yet know their positions).
- Uses other common consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (e.g., D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.).

Candidate letters remaining (besides I and L): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Good candidate words:
- ""FILMY"" – uses I and L, plus common letters F, M, Y (all still possible).
- ""LIMPY"" – same idea.
- ""BUILD"" – but 'U' is already ruled out.

""FILMY"" seems best because it’s a valid word, uses I and L, and introduces F, M, Y for more information.

Let me double-check: F, I, L, M, Y – none are in the ruled-out list, and I and L are included. Good to go.

- We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, etc.) and ensuring no repeats of already-ruled-out letters.

2. Uses two new consonants for positions 1 and 4 that have not yet been eliminated.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain frequently used letters. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE were marked “x”, so A, R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.  
I now need a fresh 5-letter word that uses none of those letters but still contains very common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (A, O, E are ruled out).

A strong starting choice is “UNTIL” because:
- It avoids every letter from AROSE.  
- It contains two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L), giving wide coverage.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
- Letters confirmed to be in the word but whose positions are unknown: I, L.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
- DOES contain both I and L (but we don’t yet know their positions).
- Uses other common consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (e.g., D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.).

Candidate letters remaining (besides I and L): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Good candidate words:
- ""FILMY"" – uses I and L, plus common letters F, M, Y (all still possible).
- ""LIMPY"" – same idea.
- ""BUILD"" – but 'U' is already ruled out.

""FILMY"" seems best because it’s a valid word, uses I and L, and introduces F, M, Y for more information.

Let me double-check: F, I, L, M, Y – none are in the ruled-out list, and I and L are included. Good to go.

Guess 3: FILMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) L(✓) M(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Letters completely ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: I ✓, L ✓, Y ✓
- Exact positions so far:
  – I is in position 2 (from FEEDBACK on FILMY)
  – L is in position 3 (from FEEDBACK on FILMY)
  – Y is in position 5 (from FEEDBACK on FILMY)
- We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining letters (B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, etc.) and ensuring no repeats of already-ruled-out letters.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Places I, L, and Y in their known correct spots (2, 3, 5).
2. Uses two new consonants for positions 1 and 4 that have not yet been eliminated.

Candidate consonants for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W.

Let’s try a word like B I L K Y – it keeps I, L, Y fixed and introduces B and K. Another option is H I L P Y or D I L V Y. ""BILKY"" is a valid English word meaning ""containing bilk or fraud"", so let’s go with that.

Checks:
- B: not ruled out.
- I: known ✓, position 2.
- L: known ✓, position 3.
- K: not ruled out.
- Y: known ✓, position 5.
And no letters from the excluded set are used.

What we now know:

1. Letters completely eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, B, K

2. Fixed letters and positions (from feedback on guesses 3 & 4):
   - Position 2 = I ✓
   - Position 3 = L ✓
   - Position 5 = Y ✓

3. Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown; they must be chosen from the remaining letters.

Remaining available letters for positions 1 & 4:
   - Consonants: C, D, G, H, J, P, V, W
   (no vowels left to try; also, no repeats allowed)

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form:
   ? I L ? Y

Current confirmed information:

- Positions:
  1 2 3 4 5
  W I L ? Y ✓ (all letters in these positions are now locked)

- Fourth position must be a consonant that has NOT yet been ruled out.
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, B, K, D.

That leaves only the following single-letter consonants still available for position 4:
C, G, H, J, P, V.

We need a valid English word of the form W I L _ Y.

Scanning the dictionary, the only common word is:
W I L C Y  (a Scottish variant spelling of “wily”), but the more universally accepted spelling is “wily” (4 letters) and “wilcy” is not in standard dictionaries.

Next option: W I L G Y – not a word.
W I L H Y – not a word.
W I L J Y – not a word.
W I L P Y – not a word.
W I L V Y – not a word.

There appears to be no standard 5-letter English word matching W I L _ Y with any of the remaining consonants. This suggests an earlier deduction must be off.

Re-evaluate: the feedback never said I and L are in positions 2 and 3; they are merely confirmed to be present.  
Let me reconstruct:

- Letters definitely in the word: I, L, Y.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, B, K, D.

Thus the actual word is some permutation of {I, L, Y} plus two other consonants chosen from the still-allowed set {C, G, H, J, P, V, W}.

We have used WILDY and it returned W ✓ at position 1, so position 1 is now locked to W.

Therefore, the word must begin with W and must contain I, L, Y somewhere. We already tried WILDY (W I L D Y) and got D(x), so D is out.

Try next candidate: WILGY – not a word.
WILJY – not a word.

Continuing systematically: the only remaining plausible English word that starts with W, contains I, L, Y, and uses only allowed letters is:

W I L L Y – but L is duplicated and we do not yet know if L appears twice.

However, L has only been confirmed once, so duplication is still possible.  
""WILLY"" is a valid English word.

Let me check letters:
- W: allowed (already confirmed in position 1)
- I: confirmed in word
- L: confirmed in word
- L: second L is still possible (only one L confirmed so far)
- Y: confirmed in word

No disallowed letters appear. So this is the only remaining candidate.

Therefore the secret word must be WILLY.
