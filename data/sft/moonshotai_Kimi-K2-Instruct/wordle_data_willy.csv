For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should help me gather information about which of these frequently occurring letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on my first guess (AROSE), every single letter was marked “x”, meaning none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That wipes out five of the most common letters, so my next guess should:

1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
2. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize new information.  
3. Still be a valid 5-letter English word.

A strong second-guess candidate that satisfies these constraints is “UNITY”:

- Contains common remaining vowels U, I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
- Includes common consonants N and T.  
- Uses none of the already-eliminated letters.

- C: C I L _ Y → “CILIA” – already ruled out A
- D: D I L _ Y → “DILLY” – valid word, uses D and second L

- H: H I L _ Y → “HILLY” – uses H and second L
- W: W I L _ Y → “WILLY” – uses W and second L
- P: P I L _ Y → “PILLY” – not a dictionary word

Among these, “DILLY”, “GILLY”, “HILLY”, and “WILLY” are all legitimate English words. Since we have only one chance left to guess the exact word, and we have no further information about which of these letters is correct, we should choose the most common or neutral option. “DILLY” is a well-known word and uses the next most common consonant D after the others.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should help me gather information about which of these frequently occurring letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on my first guess (AROSE), every single letter was marked “x”, meaning none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That wipes out five of the most common letters, so my next guess should:

1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
2. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize new information.  
3. Still be a valid 5-letter English word.

A strong second-guess candidate that satisfies these constraints is “UNITY”:

- Contains common remaining vowels U, I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
- Includes common consonants N and T.  
- Uses none of the already-eliminated letters.

This should give useful feedback about the presence/position of U, N, I, T, Y.

- A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- Word ends in Y.
- Contains I somewhere other than position 3.
- Cannot contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.

Letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus I (not in 3rd spot) and Y (already at spot 5).

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
- Ends with Y (required).
- Contains I in a spot other than 3.
- Uses other common remaining consonants (like D, L, etc.).

Candidate words: “FLIPY” (invalid), “MIDDY” (valid but uses D twice), “FILMY” (uses F, L, M, I, Y).  
“FILMY” seems reasonable: F, L, M, I, Y. None of the excluded letters appear, and I is in position 4 (not 3), satisfying the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters known NOT to appear anywhere: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, D, B  
- Letters known to be in the word (and in their exact positions):  
  – I in position 2  
  – L in position 3  
  – L in position 4  
  – Y in position 5  

So the word must have the pattern: _ I L L Y  
And the only remaining spot (position 1) must be a consonant that has not been ruled out and still makes a valid English word.

The consonants NOT yet eliminated are: C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The standard English word that fits _ I L L Y with one of these consonants is:

- G I L L Y  →  “GILLY”.

All other consonants either do not produce a recognized word or are extremely obscure. Therefore, GILLY is the only plausible solution left.

(We have one guess remaining; this must be it.)
