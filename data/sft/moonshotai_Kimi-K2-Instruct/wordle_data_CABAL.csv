For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains the three most common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about the letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A is in the word but not in the first position (-)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (x)

So the secret word contains an A somewhere (but not first), and does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Letters remaining to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
I still need a good spread of vowels and consonants. Since A is confirmed, I should keep it and test new vowels (I, U) and some common unused consonants.

A good next guess is ""TAINT"": it re-uses the confirmed A (in a new position) and introduces T, I, N.  
But wait – T is untested, I is new, N is common, and we have two Ts? No, TAINT is T-A-I-N-T – not ideal because of repeated T.

Better choice: ""PLANT"" – P, L, N, T are new consonants and we place the known A in the 2nd slot to test its new position.

However ""PLANT"" might be too consonant-heavy.  
Another balanced choice: ""FAINT"" – F, I, N, T plus the known A in 2nd slot.

I'll go with ""FAINT"".

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- A is definitely in position 2.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, F, I, N, T, M, Y.
- Letters tried so far:
  – A (correct in position 2)
  – B (present but wrong position)
  – L (present but wrong position)

Remaining available letters for other positions:
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- Only letters from the allowed set
- Re-using B and L in new positions (since they are confirmed present but not positioned correctly)

Looking at the pattern _ A B L _ or _ A L B _ or similar:

Possible words:
1. CABLE – but E is excluded
2. GABLE – E excluded
3. TABLE – T, E excluded
4. HABLE – not a valid word
5. CABBY – B repeated and Y excluded
6. GABBY – same issue
7. Valid word: ""CABAL"" – but B is repeated and L is repeated, which might waste slots
8. ""HABLU"" – not a word
9. ""PABUL"" – not a word
10. ""VABUL"" – not a word

Looking at other valid words with _ A _ _ _, using B and L in other positions:

- ""BATCH"" – T, C, H available, but T is excluded
- ""CABER"" – E, R excluded
- ""LABEL"" – E, L repeated
- ""HABIT"" – T, I excluded

Actually, the word must have:
- A in position 2
- B somewhere (not position 1, from feedback)
- L somewhere (not position 3, from feedback)
- No other letters that are excluded

Let's try:
- ""CABLY"" – but Y is excluded
- ""VABLY"" – Y excluded
- ""GABLY"" – Y excluded

Another approach: use B and L in positions 4 and 5. For example:

- _ A _ B L or _ A B _ L or _ A _ L B

Looking for valid words:
- ""PABUL"" – invalid
- ""DABBL"" – invalid
- ""GABBL"" – invalid
- ""HABBL"" – invalid

Next try: ""CABBY"" – but Y excluded and B repeated.

Looking back, we have limited options. The word must be _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2, B and L elsewhere, and only allowed letters.

Valid candidate: ""CABAL"" – has:
- C (new)
- A (correct)
- B (known present, in position 3 – previously was position 1)
- A (repeated, but A is allowed and in correct position)
- L (known present, in position 5 – previously was position 3)

This tests:
- B in new position (3)
- L in new position (5)
- C as new letter in position 1

<CABAL> seems the best next move.
