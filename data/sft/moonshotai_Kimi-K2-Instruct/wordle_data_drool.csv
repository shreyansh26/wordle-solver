For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAINE (R, A, I, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but less consonants)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter)

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word (x)
- R is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2)

So we know:
- Word form: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N, E
- Keep in mind which letters are still possible: all others except C, A, N, E

We still have no information about the vowels O, I, U, Y or any other consonants. Good next step is to try a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Uses new letters we haven't tested (especially common ones)
3. Introduces some vowels (since we only know A and E are out)

Good candidate letters to test: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, V, etc.

I'll choose ""TROOP"" - it places R correctly in position 2, introduces T and P which are common, and uses O which is a vowel we haven't tested. Also keeps P in a new position to maximize info.

Current knowledge:

1. Word pattern: _ R O O _  (R in slot 2, O’s in slots 3 & 4)
2. Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, T, P, B
3. From Guess 3 we now know that D is in the word but NOT in slot 5 (-).

Because slots 1 and 5 are still open, and D must appear somewhere, the only remaining place for D is slot 1.  
So pattern becomes: D R O O _

That leaves slot 5 to be any letter except the ones already excluded. Common remaining consonants: S, K, L, M, etc.  
A very common word that fits DROO_ is DROOK (rare), DROOM (Dutch), but more likely DROOL – yet L wasn’t tested so far and is common.  
Let me try DROOL.

But wait, in Guess 3 we used BROOD and got D(-), so D is NOT in slot 5. In DROOL, L would be in slot 5. We haven’t eliminated L, so that’s acceptable.  
Actually, we already used DROOL in the previous think process as a candidate; but we haven’t guessed it yet.

Actually the only common English word that fits DROO_ is DROOL.  
Let’s guess it.

Wait, in Guess 3 we guessed BROOD, not DROOL, so DROOL is still untried.

Therefore the safest next guess is DROOL.
