- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This is the first guess, so there's no feedback yet. The strategy here is to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Good first guesses often include vowels and common consonants. A classic strong starting word is ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)
This covers a wide range of frequently used letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, E, R, I, C, H  

Letters definitely IN the word (with positional info):  
- N is in position 4.  
- T is in position 5.  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN) and NOT in position 3 (from CHANT).  So A can be in 1, 2, or 4.  Position 4 is already claimed by N, so A must be in 1 or 2.

We still need two more distinct consonants, chosen from the letters that have never been tested or ruled out.  Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

We want a word that:
- places N at 4, T at 5  
- places A at 1 or 2  
- uses two new consonants in the remaining slots.

Possible patterns:  
A N T _ _  – but N must be 4 and T must be 5, so positions 3 and 4 are taken, leaving 3 open.  
Wait, the patterns are:
_ _ _ N T  

A can be 1 or 2.  Let’s try A in position 1: A _ _ N T  
Then positions 2 and 3 must be new consonants.

Common consonants that fit: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Let’s choose D and M, forming A D M N T → “ADMNT” – not a valid word.  
Let’s try A G M N T → “AGMNT” – invalid.  
Try A P N T – no, needs 5 letters.  
Let’s pick A B D N T → “ABDNT” – invalid.  
Let’s try A M O N T – invalid.  
Better approach: look for real words that fit the pattern.

Valid pattern: _ _ A N T  
A is in 3 – but we know A can’t be in 3.  
So only possible patterns are:  
A _ _ N T  
or  
_ A _ N T  

Let’s list real 5-letter words ending in “ANT” or “…ANT” with N in 4 and T in 5.  Common ones:  
- ADANT – invalid  
- BAUNT – invalid  
- GAUNT – uses G (allowed), A in 2, U untested.  
- HAUNT – H is out  
- JAUNT – J untested  
- MAUNT – invalid  
- PAUNT – invalid  
- VAUNT – V allowed  
- WAUNT – invalid  
- DAUNT – D allowed  

“DAUNT” and “GAUNT” and “VAUNT” are all valid.  Among these, “DAUNT” uses D and U.  U has not been tested yet.  It fits:
D (new consonant)  
A (position 2 – allowed)  
U (new vowel)  
N (position 4 – correct)  
T (position 5 – correct)  

So “DAUNT” satisfies every constraint.
