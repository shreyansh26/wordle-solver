For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word with common letters to maximize information gained. The best starting words contain a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. Common recommendations include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - though this is more vowel-heavy
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give good coverage for identifying letters early on.

From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct (second) position (✓).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So A appears somewhere, but not in the third position.
- N is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
1. Letter pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. Contains an A, but not in the third position.
3. Does NOT contain C, N, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R _ _ _, contains A (but not in position 3), and does not have C, N, or E. Good consonants to try next (since C and N are out) might be S, T, L, M, etc.

One such word is ""GRASP"":
- G is a common consonant, not yet tested.
- R is in the correct position.
- A is in position 3, but we know A cannot be in position 3 from the feedback (A(-) in CRANE). So GRASP is invalid because A would be in position 3.

Next try ""DRAWS"":
- D is new.
- R is in correct position.
- A is in position 3 again - same problem.

Next try ""BRAVO"":
- B is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - still invalid.

Next try ""FRANK"":
- F is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.
- Also N is in word (from FRANK), but N is already excluded.

Next try ""TRAMP"":
- T is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

Next try ""PRAWN"":
- P is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.
- Also N is excluded.

Next try ""GRAIL"":
- G is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.
- Also L is fine.

Next try ""FRAIL"":
- F is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

Next try ""DRAWL"":
- D is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

Next try ""ORATE"":
- O is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.
- Also E is excluded.

Next try ""TRASH"":
- T is new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

Wait, we need a word where A isn't in position 3. Let's think of _ R A _ _ or _ R _ A _ or _ R _ _ A.

For _ R A _ _:
- ""BRAID"" - D is fine, but contains I and D (no exclusions), no C,N,E. A is in position 3 - invalid.

For _ R _ A _:
- ""DRAKE"" - contains E which is excluded.
- ""GRAPE"" - contains E and P is fine, but E is excluded.
- ""CRASH"" - C is excluded.
- ""BRAND"" - N is excluded.
- ""FRAIL"" - A is position 4, but I and L are fine, no C,N,E. This seems possible.

But FRAIL has A in position 4, which is allowed since A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So FRAIL is valid.

Also:
- ""GRASP"" was invalid because A was in position 3, but FRAIL has A in position 4.
- ""TRASH"" has A in position 3 - invalid.

Another valid option is ""GRAFT"":
- G, F, T are new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

""DRAFT"":
- D, F, T are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""TRAMP"":
- T, M, P are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""BRAID"":
- B, I, D are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""FRAIL"" seems the best so far:
- F, I, L are new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 4 (not excluded).
- No C, N, E.

""GRAIL"" has A in position 3 - invalid.

""PRAWN"" has N - invalid.

""BRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""DRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""GRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""FRAIL"" is the most promising.

Another check: ""TRAIL"":
- T, I, L are new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

""GRAIL"" - same issue.

""FRAIL"" seems to be the only valid option here where A isn't in position 3.

But wait, let's think of _ R _ _ A:
- ""BRIAR"" - B, I are new, A is last position, no C,N,E. This seems valid.
- ""PRIAR"" - not a valid word.
- ""DRIAR"" - not valid.
- ""FRIAR"" - F, I are new, A is last position, valid word.

Between FRAIL and FRIAR, both are valid:
- FRAIL: F, R, A, I, L
- FRIAR: F, R, I, A, R

FRIAR has R twice, but that's allowed if the word has two Rs, though unlikely. FRAIL seems more likely.

But looking back, FRAIL has A in position 4 (acceptable), while FRIAR has A in position 4 as well, but repeats R. FRAIL is probably better.

However, another option is ""GRAIL"" but A is in position 3 - invalid.

Actually, looking again at the pattern _ R _ _ _, and A cannot be in position 3, possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.

Let's list words with A in position 1: A R _ _ _
- ""AROMA"" - O, M are new, no C,N,E, but has O and M, and A is in position 1. This seems valid.
- ""ARGUE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ARMED"" - E is excluded.
- ""ARROW"" - W is new, but repeats R which is already in position 2, so this would imply two Rs, which is possible.

But AROMA seems good: A in position 1, R in position 2, O, M are new.

But A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Position 1 is fine.

But is AROMA a common word? Yes, it's valid.

Another option with A in position 4: _ R _ A _
- ""GRAFT"" - A is in position 3 - invalid.
- ""BRAVO"" - A is in position 3 - invalid.
- ""FRANK"" - N is excluded.

Actually, _ R _ A _ is hard because position 3 is invalid for A.

A in position 5: _ R _ _ A
- ""BRIAR"" - B, I are new, A is in position 5, no C,N,E. Valid.
- ""CRIAR"" - C is excluded.
- ""DRIAR"" - not a word.
- ""FRIAR"" - F, I are new, A is in position 5, valid.

Between AROMA, BRIAR, and FRIAR, let's choose FRIAR as it keeps R in position 2 and introduces F and I with A in position 5.

But FRAIL also has A in position 4, and is valid.

FRAIL seems more likely as a common word.

After reconsideration, ""FRAIL"" is the better choice as it's a common word fitting all constraints.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- R is correctly in the second position.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- C, N, and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""FRAIL"" because:
- It has R in the correct second position.
- It includes A in the fourth position (not excluded).
- It introduces F and I as new letters to test.
- It does not contain C, N, or E.

- D, F, T are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""TRAMP"":
- T, M, P are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""BRAID"":
- B, I, D are new.
- R is correct.
- A in position 3 - invalid.

""FRAIL"" seems the best so far:
- F, I, L are new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 4 (not excluded).
- No C, N, E.

""GRAIL"" has A in position 3 - invalid.

""PRAWN"" has N - invalid.

""BRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""DRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""GRAIN"" has N - invalid.

""FRAIL"" is the most promising.

Another check: ""TRAIL"":
- T, I, L are new.
- R is correct.
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

""GRAIL"" - same issue.

""FRAIL"" seems to be the only valid option here where A isn't in position 3.

But wait, let's think of _ R _ _ A:
- ""BRIAR"" - B, I are new, A is last position, no C,N,E. This seems valid.
- ""PRIAR"" - not a valid word.
- ""DRIAR"" - not valid.
- ""FRIAR"" - F, I are new, A is last position, valid word.

Between FRAIL and FRIAR, both are valid:
- FRAIL: F, R, A, I, L
- FRIAR: F, R, I, A, R

FRIAR has R twice, but that's allowed if the word has two Rs, though unlikely. FRAIL seems more likely.

But looking back, FRAIL has A in position 4 (acceptable), while FRIAR has A in position 4 as well, but repeats R. FRAIL is probably better.

However, another option is ""GRAIL"" but A is in position 3 - invalid.

Actually, looking again at the pattern _ R _ _ _, and A cannot be in position 3, possible positions for A are 1, 4, or 5.

Let's list words with A in position 1: A R _ _ _
- ""AROMA"" - O, M are new, no C,N,E, but has O and M, and A is in position 1. This seems valid.
- ""ARGUE"" - E is excluded.
- ""ARMED"" - E is excluded.
- ""ARROW"" - W is new, but repeats R which is already in position 2, so this would imply two Rs, which is possible.

But AROMA seems good: A in position 1, R in position 2, O, M are new.

But A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Position 1 is fine.

But is AROMA a common word? Yes, it's valid.

Another option with A in position 4: _ R _ A _
- ""GRAFT"" - A is in position 3 - invalid.
- ""BRAVO"" - A is in position 3 - invalid.
- ""FRANK"" - N is excluded.

Actually, _ R _ A _ is hard because position 3 is invalid for A.

A in position 5: _ R _ _ A
- ""BRIAR"" - B, I are new, A is in position 5, no C,N,E. Valid.
- ""CRIAR"" - C is excluded.
- ""DRIAR"" - not a word.
- ""FRIAR"" - F, I are new, A is in position 5, valid.

Between AROMA, BRIAR, and FRIAR, let's choose FRIAR as it keeps R in position 2 and introduces F and I with A in position 5.

But FRAIL also has A in position 4, and is valid.

FRAIL seems more likely as a common word.

After reconsideration, ""FRAIL"" is the better choice as it's a common word fitting all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- R is correctly in the second position.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- C, N, and E are not in the word.

A good next guess is ""FRAIL"" because:
- It has R in the correct second position.
- It includes A in the fourth position (not excluded).
- It introduces F and I as new letters to test.
- It does not contain C, N, or E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in position 2 and is correct.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - C, N, E are NOT in the word.

2. FRAIL → F(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) L(✓)
   - R is again confirmed in position 2.
   - A is again marked “-” (in word but wrong place).  
     In FRAIL, A was in position 3 → so A cannot be in position 3.
   - I is marked “-” → I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - L is marked “✓” → L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ L
- Contains A and I, but
  – A ≠ position 3
  – I ≠ position 4
- Excludes letters: C, N, E, F
- Position 2 = R and position 5 = L are locked.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R _ _ L and satisfies the above.

Possible structures for A and I:
- A could be in 1 or 4 (not 3).
- I could be in 1, 2 (but 2 is R), 3 or 5 (but 5 is L), so I must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s list candidates:

1. A R I _ L → AR _ I L but we only have one letter between R and L; impossible.
2. _ R A I L → GRA I L (GRAIL) – but L is already known to be in position 5 and this would put I in position 4, which is disallowed (I ≠ position 4).
3. _ R I A L → BRIAL (not a valid word), PRIAL (valid but P is untested, I is in 3, A in 4) – seems valid.
4. A R _ I L → AR _ I L – needs five letters; cannot fit.

PRIAL is valid and matches:
- Pattern: P(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) L(5)
- Contains A and I in allowed positions.
- No C, N, E, F.
- R and L in correct spots.

Another candidate: TRIAL – but E is excluded from earlier, and TRIAL contains no forbidden letters, but:
- T R I A L: A is in 4 (ok), I is in 3 (ok), no excluded letters – also valid.

Between PRIAL and TRIAL, TRIAL is more common.

So choose TRIAL.
