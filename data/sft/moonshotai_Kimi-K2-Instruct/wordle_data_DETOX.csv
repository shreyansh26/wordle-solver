For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these without repeating letters. 

Some popular strong first guesses are:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

Among these, I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters and covers both consonants and vowels efficiently. This should give us good feedback on which letters are in the word and their positions.

- A (3rd letter) is not in the word → x  
- T (4th letter) is in the word but not in that position → -

So we know:
- T and E are definitely in the word, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Next guess should:

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. From SLATE:  
   – S, L, A are NOT in the word at all (x).  
   – T is in the word, but not in position 4 (-).  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5 (-).

2. From ENTER:  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 1 (-).  
   – T is confirmed in position 3 (✓).  
   – N and R are NOT in the word (x).

So the constraints so far:
- Letters present: T (fixed at position 3) and at least one E.
- Letters absent: S, L, A, N, R.
- E must appear somewhere other than positions 1 and 5.
- T is already locked at position 3, so we don’t need to test T elsewhere.

We still need to discover the other three letters (positions 1, 2, 4).  
Good untested common letters include: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

A word that:
- has T in position 3,  
- keeps E not in positions 1 or 5,  
- avoids all banned letters,  
- and introduces several new consonants/vowels,

is “WITCH”:
- W (new), I (new), T (✓), C (new), H (new).  
- E is missing, but we are certain E is present, so let’s instead pick a word containing E in position 2 or 4.

A better choice is “ETHIC”:
- E (position 1) – but we know E is NOT allowed in position 1.  
Oops, let’s avoid that.

Try “PETTY”:
- P (new), E (position 2 allowed), T (position 3 ✓), T (but T already confirmed, repeating is fine), Y (new).  
But we need a 5-letter word with only one T, since T is already fixed at position 3 and we want to test new letters.

A clean word that satisfies everything: “WETLY”
- W, E (position 2), T (position 3), L (already banned), Y — but L cannot be used.

“BESET”:
E is in position 2 (allowed), T at 3 (✓), B, S (banned), E (ok). S is banned.

“VET CH” – not valid.

Let’s use a systematic approach:  
Letters allowed: anything except S, L, A, N, R.

E must appear somewhere (positions 2 or 4).

Let’s use a systematic approach:  
Letters allowed: anything except S, L, A, N, R.  
Word template: _ _ T _ _  
E must appear somewhere (positions 2 or 4).

Candidate that fits: “DETER” – but R is banned.  
“FETID”: F, E (pos 2), T (pos 3), I, D — all letters allowed.  
This looks good.

“FETID”:
- F (new), E (pos 2, allowed), T (pos 3, ✓), I (new), D (new).  
No banned letters, and tests two new vowels and two new consonants.

Let’s go with FETID.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters present:  
   – T must be in position 3 (✓ from Enter and Fetid).  
   – E must be present; last guess shows it is in position 2 (✓).

2. Letters absent:  
   – S, L, A, N, R, F, I are out.  
   – D is in the word but not in position 5 (- from Fetid).

3. Current word skeleton:  
   _ E T _ _

4. Unused common letters that remain legal:  
   C, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, plus D (which must appear somewhere other than position 5).

We need two more letters in positions 1 and 4, choosing from the legal set, ensuring D appears (since it’s in the word but not at pos 5).

Possible pattern with D in position 4:  
_ E T D _

Candidate letters for position 1: C, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

A simple choice is “WETDU” – but “WETDU” is not a valid English word.  
“CETDY” – invalid.  
“MEDTU” – invalid.

Let’s loop over valid English words that fit _ET_D:

A quick scan gives: “BETID” (B banned), “GETUP” (P not tested yet but P is allowed), “WETLY” (Y legal, L banned).  

Actually, “VETCH” contains H and C which are still legal.  But we need E at pos 2 and T at pos 3: V E T C H → V(1) E(2) T(3) C(4) H(5).  This uses C and H, both still untested.  It also satisfies that D is somewhere in word, but wait – D must be used and we haven’t placed it.  So VETCH won’t work.

We must include D somewhere.  Positions left: 1, 4, 5.  D cannot be at 5, so it must be at 1 or 4.

Option 1: D in position 1 → D E T _ _  
   Possible endings: need two letters from C, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.  
   DETOX – X not yet tested and legal.  DETOX is a valid word.

Option 2: D in position 4 → _ E T D _  
   Possible starts: C, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.  
   “CETDA” – invalid.  
   “METDY” – invalid.  
   “HUTDE” – invalid.  

DETOX looks like the only clean valid choice that incorporates D not in position 5, keeps E at 2, T at 3, and introduces new letters (O, X).  Both O and X are still legal (never tested).

Therefore, next guess: DETOX
