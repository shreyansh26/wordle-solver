2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains commonly used letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and potentially giving us good feedback on multiple letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and already in the correct position (3).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains R, O, S.
2. O is in position 3.
3. R is not in position 2.
4. S is not in position 4.
5. The letters A and E are excluded entirely.

Good next-step words should place O in position 3, include R and S elsewhere, and avoid A and E. Some possibilities:
- R and S should appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but respecting their exclusions).
- We also want to test new common letters (like T, N, L, I, etc.).

Candidate words:
1. SORRY – but O is in position 2 here, not 3.
2. FROST – O is in position 3, includes R and S. R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So this is invalid.
3. FROGS – same issue with R in position 2.
4. FROWS – same.
5. TORSO – O is in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 4 (invalid).
6. BROOK – O in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid).
7. CROSS – O in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 4 (invalid).
8. DROSS – same issues.
9. PROSO – O in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 4 (invalid).
10. GROSS – same.
11. TROOP – O in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid).
12. SPORT – O in position 3, R in position 2 (invalid), S in position 1 (valid), but we don’t know about P or T yet.

Let’s try ""SPORT"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 before and feedback says ""not in 4"").
- P is new, T is new.
- R is in position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2. So ""SPORT"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""STORY"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- T is new, R is in position 3 (allowed, since O must be in position 3), but R cannot be in position 3 because O is already there. So invalid.

Next: ""SNORT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed), N is new, O in position 3 (✓), R in position 4 (allowed), T is new.
Check constraints:
- R is in position 4 (was in position 2 before, so allowed).

This seems valid.

- S in 1, H is new, O in 3 (✓), R in 4 (allowed), N is new. Also valid.

4. Other letters are still possible.

List of words that fit:

- S _ O R T → only possible is S _ O R T, because position 2 must be T if T is in the word.

Thus the word must be “S T O R T” or “S _ O R T”. “STORT” is not an English word, so we need to reconsider.

Actually, the pattern is: S _ O R _  and T must be in 2 or 5.

Possible English words:
- S T O R E – but E is forbidden (from AROSE feedback).
- S T O R K – valid word.
- S T O R M – valid word.
- S T O R Y – Y is possible.
- S _ O R T – other possibilities: no common word fits except STORT (invalid).

- STORK: uses K (new letter), all positions align, no forbidden letters.
- STORM: uses M (new letter), all positions align, no forbidden letters.

All three fit. I’ll pick STORM because M is a common letter.
