For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains a variety of common letters and no repeats, as this will help me gather maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Looking at these, I'll select a word that uses many of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SLATE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage across the alphabet.

From the feedback:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the hidden word contains the letters R, O, E, but none of A or S. Also:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has no A or S
2. Uses R, O, E in positions different from those
3. Uses two additional letters (from the remaining 21 letters)

Candidate consonants to pair with R, O, E: T, L, N, C, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.

A good approach is to keep the known letters (R, O, E) and add new common consonants to test. Let’s try placing R, O, E in different positions and add T and L to cover new ground.

One solid candidate is “TROPE”:
- Uses R, O, E
- Places R in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2 in AROSE, and here it’s in position 2 which is different from the original position 2 in AROSE? Wait, in AROSE, the R was in position 2, and the feedback said R(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2. So in the new word, R must not be in position 2. Therefore TROPE is invalid because R is in position 2.

Let me rethink:
R cannot be in position 2
O cannot be in position 3
E cannot be in position 5

Next candidate: “ROGER”
- R in position 1 (ok)
- O in position 2 (ok, was originally in 3)
- G and E and R
But this uses R twice, which is inefficient for testing new letters.

Better: “GROPE”
- G, R, O, P, E
- R in position 2 - no, same issue as TROPE.

“PROLE”:
- P, R, O, L, E
- R in position 2 - again no.

“OILER”:
- O, I, L, E, R
- R in position 5 (ok)
- O in position 1 (ok, was originally in 3)
- E in position 4 (ok, was originally in 5)
This seems valid and introduces new letters I and L.

- R in position 1 (ok)
- O in position 2 (ok, was originally in 3)
- G and E and R
But this uses R twice, which is inefficient for testing new letters.

Better: “GROPE”
- G, R, O, P, E
- R in position 2 - no, same issue as TROPE.

“PROLE”:
- P, R, O, L, E
- R in position 2 - again no.

“OILER”:
- O, I, L, E, R
- R in position 5 (ok)
- O in position 1 (ok, was originally in 3)

So the hidden word contains the letters R, O, E, but none of A or S. Also:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has no A or S
2. Uses R, O, E in positions different from those
3. Uses two additional letters (from the remaining 21 letters)

Candidate consonants to pair with R, O, E: T, L, N, C, P, M, D, G, B, F, etc.

A good approach is to keep the known letters (R, O, E) and add new common consonants to test. Let’s try placing R, O, E in different positions and add T and L to cover new ground.

One solid candidate is “TROPE”:
- Uses R, O, E

Therefore TROPE is invalid because R is in position 2.

Let me rethink:
R cannot be in position 2
O cannot be in position 3
E cannot be in position 5

Next candidate: “ROGER”
- R in position 1 (ok)
- O in position 2 (ok, was originally in 3)
- G and E and R
But this uses R twice, which is inefficient for testing new letters.

Better: “GROPE”
- G, R, O, P, E
- R in position 2 - no, same issue as TROPE.

“PROLE”:
- P, R, O, L, E
- R in position 2 - again no.

“OILER”:
- O, I, L, E, R
- R in position 5 (ok)
- O in position 1 (ok, was originally in 3)
- E in position 4 (ok, was originally in 5)
This seems valid and introduces new letters I and L.

We now have four pieces of feedback.  Summarizing what is certain:

Letters NOT in the word: A, S, I, L, C, V, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: B, O, E, R  
Known positions:
- Position 2 = O (from COVER feedback)  
- Position 4 = E (from OILER feedback)  
- Position 5 = R (from OILER feedback)  
- Position 1 = B (from BONER feedback)  

That leaves only position 3 still unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- isn’t in the forbidden list above,  
- hasn’t appeared in any previous feedback,  
- and forms a valid English word.

Allowed letters (excluding all the forbidden ones):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z  

We want a common consonant that fits naturally between B O _ E R.  
The most common consonants in that middle slot are D, G, M, T.  
Testing them mentally:
- B O D E R – valid word (“BODER” isn’t, but “BODGER” is too long; wait, “BOD” is a stem, but “BODER” isn’t)  
- B O G E R – “BOGER” isn’t a common word.  
- B O M E R – “BOMER” isn’t valid.  
- B O P E R – “BOPER” isn’t valid.  
- B O T E R – “BOTER” isn’t valid.  

Actually, English 5-letter words that fit B O _ E R are limited.  
The real word that comes to mind is “BOXER”.  
Let me check:
- X isn’t in any forbidden list.  
- “BOXER” is a valid 5-letter word.  
- It fits the pattern B O _ E R.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “BOXER”.
