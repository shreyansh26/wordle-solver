For my first guess in a 5-letter word game, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should:

1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants
3. Have letters that appear frequently in English words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It uses 5 unique letters, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid English word

This combination should help me quickly identify which vowels and common consonants are in the target word, as well as their positions.

Current known facts:

1. Fixed letters: S (1), A (3) → pattern S _ A _ _
2. Eliminated letters: R, O, E, T, I, N, Y
3. New feedback from SCALY:
   - C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in position 2
   - L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4
4. Remaining slots: positions 2, 4, 5
   - Letters already known to be in the word and needing placement: C, L
   - We still need one more letter that hasn’t been used or ruled out.

Remaining valid letters (that haven’t appeared in any guess yet and weren’t ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Z

We need:
- C must go in position 4 or 5
- L must go in position 2 or 5
- One additional letter for the remaining slot.

Let’s try placing C and L in the only remaining valid positions:
- C can’t be in position 2, so it must be 4 or 5
- L can’t be in position 4, so it must be 2 or 5
But position 5 can’t hold both C and L, so they must go in positions 2 and 4/5

Possible configurations:
- If L is in position 2, then C must be in position 4 or 5
- If C is in position 5, then L must be in position 2

A possible word following this: S L A C _ → needs a final letter
The only remaining slot is position 5. Valid letters left: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Z

Let’s choose a common letter like D:
SLACD – not a valid word
Let’s try another valid word: S L A C _ → SLACK is valid, but we’ve used C already in this word
Wait no, SLACK would have C in position 4, which is allowed (C is in the word and not in position 2)
This seems valid. Let’s check:
S(✓) L(-) A(✓) C(-) K(x) → but we haven’t tested K yet. Is K allowed? K wasn’t ruled out in any feedback, but it’s not in our eliminated list either. However, from previous guesses, K hasn’t appeared, so it’s potentially valid.

But looking back at the eliminated letters list (R, O, E, T, I, N, Y), K isn’t among them, so SLACK could be a valid test.

Alternatively, another valid word: S P A C _ → SPACY but Y is eliminated
S C A L _ → SC... but C can’t be in position 2
S L A C K seems the most straightforward test with remaining letters.
