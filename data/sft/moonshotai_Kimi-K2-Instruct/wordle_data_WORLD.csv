For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. 

A popular first guess that covers many common letters is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x) — so we can eliminate all words containing S.
- L is in the word but NOT in 2nd position (-).
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x) — so we can eliminate any words with these letters.

So far we know:
- The word contains L (but not in position 2).
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

We also know positions 1,3,4,5 are NOT S,A,T,E. The remaining common letters are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

Since we’ve ruled out so many common letters, let’s pick a word that introduces several new high-frequency consonants and a vowel we haven’t used yet. A good candidate is “CHILD” because:
- It includes C, H, I, L, D — none of which are S, A, T, E.
- L is present but not in position 2 (it’s position 3), satisfying the feedback.
- The vowel I hasn’t been tested yet.
- C, H, D are fairly common consonants we haven’t used.

This should give us more information about remaining letters and positions.
