For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants.

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A strong opening word would contain several of these. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains four of the top 10 most common letters plus C which is also quite common. This should give good coverage to help identify letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ A N _ with no C, R, or E allowed.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits _ _ A N _ and uses only letters not yet ruled out. Common letters that remain available include: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, O, U, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z.

Good candidates fitting _ _ A N _:
- STAND (S, T)
- PLANT (P, L, T)
- SPANK (S, P, K)
- BLANK (B, L, K)

""STAND"" seems like a strong follow-up, as it introduces S, T, and D—three new common consonants—while keeping A and N in their confirmed positions.

Let me check: S T A N D – positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. A and N are already matched, so this is valid.

What we now know:

1. Pattern: S _ A N K  
   - Position 1: S (✓)  
   - Position 3: A (✓)  
   - Position 4: N (✓)  
   - Position 5: K (✓)

2. Letters not in the word: C, R, E, T, D, P.

3. We need a single letter for position 2 that  
   - is **not** one of the forbidden letters above,  
   - results in a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible choices for the second slot (using letters that haven’t been ruled out and keeping common letters first):

- B – gives S B A N K (SBANK isn’t a word)  
- H – gives S H A N K (SHANK – valid)  
- L – gives S L A N K (SLANK – not recognized)  
- M – gives S M A N K (SMANK – not a word)  
- W – gives S W A N K (SWANK – valid but less common)  
- G – gives S G A N K (SGANK – not a word)  
- U – gives S U A N K (SUANK – not a word)  
- V – gives S V A N K (SVANK – not a word)

The only common, valid word fitting S _ A N K is **SHANK**.

So the next logical guess is SHANK.
