For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which commonly appear in many words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters, maximizing information gain

This should provide good coverage to help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — that means E is the 5th letter.

We now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. It does not contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while incorporating the known A and E. A good candidate is ""LATE"" followed by a new letter to make 5 letters, but since E is fixed at the end, I can use ""PLATE"" — but P, L, A, T are all untested. However, since A is known to be in the word but not in position 1, I should avoid placing A in position 1. 

A better choice is ""MATED"":
- M and T are new common consonants.
- A is in the word (not at position 1), so testing it in position 2 is reasonable.
- D is another common consonant.
- E is fixed at the end (position 5).

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Knowledge so far
- E is definitely the 5th letter (✓ in guess 1).
- A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (because it was marked “-” in both guesses and appeared there).
- All letters R, O, S, M, T, D are not in the word at all (x in their respective spots).
- So the hidden word has the form _ _ _ _ E and contains A, with the A restricted to positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 2 already ruled out).

Remaining common letters that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want to test some of these quickly while placing the known A in either position 3 or 4.

A balanced probe word that uses new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3/4 while respecting the constraints is “FLANK”:
- F, L, N, K have not been checked yet.
- A is placed in position 3 (allowed).
- K ends the word, but we already know E is the 5th letter, so this would be invalid; the 5th letter must be E.  Let’s correct that.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which commonly appear in many words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters, maximizing information gain

This should provide good coverage to help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — that means E is the 5th letter.

We now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. It does not contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while incorporating the known A and E. A good candidate is ""LATE"" followed by a new letter to make 5 letters, but since E is fixed at the end, I can use ""PLATE"" — but P, L, A, T are all untested. However, since A is known to be in the word but not in position 1, I should avoid placing A in position 1. 

A better choice is ""MATED"":
- M and T are new common consonants.
- A is in the word (not at position 1), so testing it in position 2 is reasonable.
- D is another common consonant.
- E is fixed at the end (position 5).

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
2. MATED → M(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)

Knowledge so far
- E is definitely the 5th letter (✓ in guess 1).
- A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (because it was marked “-” in both guesses and appeared there).
- All letters R, O, S, M, T, D are not in the word at all (x in their respective spots).
- So the hidden word has the form _ _ _ _ E and contains A, with the A restricted to positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 2 already ruled out).

Remaining common letters that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want to test some of these quickly while placing the known A in either position 3 or 4.

A balanced probe word that uses new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3/4 while respecting the constraints is “FLANK”:
- F, L, N, K have not been checked yet.
- A is placed in position 3 (allowed).
- K ends the word, but we already know E is the 5th letter, so this would be invalid; the 5th letter must be E.  Let’s correct that.

Instead, try “FLAKE”:
Positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-A, 4-K, 5-E.
- E is fixed at 5, ✓.
- Tests F, L, K (new letters).
- Places A in position 3 (allowed).
- All letters have not been ruled out yet.

Thus, FLAKE is a valid next guess.

3. It does not contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while incorporating the known A and E. A good candidate is ""LATE"" followed by a new letter to make 5 letters, but since E is fixed at the end, I can use ""PLATE"" — but P, L, A, T are all untested. However, since A is known to be in the word but not in position 1, I should avoid placing A in position 1. 

A better choice is ""MATED"":
- M and T are new common consonants.
- A is in the word (not at position 1), so testing it in position 2 is reasonable.
- D is another common consonant.
- E is fixed at the end (position 5).

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MATED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
2. MATED → M(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)

Knowledge so far
- E is definitely the 5th letter (✓ in guess 1).
- A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (because it was marked “-” in both guesses and appeared there).
- All letters R, O, S, M, T, D are not in the word at all (x in their respective spots).
- So the hidden word has the form _ _ _ _ E and contains A, with the A restricted to positions 3 or 4 (since 1 and 2 already ruled out).

Remaining common letters that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want to test some of these quickly while placing the known A in either position 3 or 4.

A balanced probe word that uses new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3/4 while respecting the constraints is “FLANK”:
- F, L, N, K have not been checked yet.
- A is placed in position 3 (allowed).
- K ends the word, but we already know E is the 5th letter, so this would be invalid; the 5th letter must be E.  Let’s correct that.

Instead, try “FLAKE”:
Positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-A, 4-K, 5-E.
- E is fixed at 5, ✓.
- Tests F, L, K (new letters).
- Places A in position 3 (allowed).
- All letters have not been ruled out yet.

Thus, FLAKE is a valid next guess.

   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R, O, S are not in the word
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

2. MATED → M(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
   - M, T, D are not in the word
   - A is in the word but not in position 2

   - L is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
   - A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
   - E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So far, we know the word has:
- L in position 2
- A in position 3
- E in position 5
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, M, T, D, F, K

The word structure is: _ L A _ E

We need to find letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining unused letters that haven't been ruled out. The remaining common letters are: B, C, G, H, I, J, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words with the pattern _L_A_E that haven't used any of the eliminated letters, some possibilities include:
- CLAVE (but V is uncommon)
- GLARE (but R is eliminated)
- BLADE (D is eliminated)
- PLANE (N is still possible)
- SLATE (S is eliminated)

From these, ""PLANE"" seems good as:
- P, N are still possible
- Fits the pattern P L A N E
- All letters P, L, A, N, E are either confirmed or not yet eliminated

Let's check:
- P: not eliminated
- L: confirmed in position 2
- A: confirmed in position 3
- N: not eliminated
- E: confirmed in position 5

This seems like a strong next guess.

- Still-allowed letters (from common alphabet pool): B, C, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels already present.

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with two different letters that are not yet ruled out.

Candidate pairs for positions 1 and 4 (common English usage order):
B & G, C & H, G & B, C & I, etc.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words matching “_ L A _ E”:
- BLARE – R eliminated
- CLAVE – V possible
- GLARE – R eliminated
- CLINE – N eliminated
- GLACE – C possible
- GLADE – D eliminated
- BLADE – D eliminated
- CLANE – N eliminated
- GLANE – N eliminated
- CLAVE – C L A V E

CLAVE uses C and V, neither of which has been eliminated. It also keeps the known L, A, E in place. Let’s go with that.
