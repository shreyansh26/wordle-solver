### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no feedback to work with, so my goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should use common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc.

A strategically chosen first word would contain a mix of these common consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
2. Contains 2 common consonants (R, S) in positions that might help identify patterns
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

This choice should help identify which letters are in the word (even if in wrong positions) and which aren't, giving good coverage for future guesses.

From the feedback:
- A is in position 1 (✓).  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (x).

So the secret word begins with “A” and contains none of the letters R, O, S, E.  
We need a fresh set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (A is already placed).

A simple, common word that starts with A, avoids the eliminated letters, and brings in new frequent letters is “AINT” … but that’s 4 letters.  
Five-letter word: “ANIMAL” – too long.  
“ACUTE” – E is eliminated.  
“ALONE” – O, E, N are eliminated.  
“ADMIT” – uses D, M, I, T: all still allowed.

“ADMIT”:
A ✓ at 1st position, and introduces D, M, I, T – none of which have been tested.
