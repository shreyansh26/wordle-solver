For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good options would be words like:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AUDIO (lots of vowels)

I'm going to choose ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it contains five of the most common letters in English (S, L, A, T, E), which should help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is in the word and in the correct (second) position.
- T is somewhere in the word but not in the third position.
- E is somewhere in the word but not in the fifth position.
- S and A are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain T and E somewhere (not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)
- Cannot contain S or A

Possible positions for T: positions 1, 4, or 5
Possible positions for E: positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but position 2 is L, so 1,3,4)

Let me think of 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ and contain both T and E, without S or A.

Some possibilities:
- ELITE (but has E in position 5 which we know is invalid)
- BLOTE (but O is not ruled out, but this is rare)
- GLUTE (G not ruled out)
- FLUTE (F not ruled out)
- BLITE (but I not ruled out, but this is rare)
- PLUTE (P not ruled out, but rare)
- CLUTE (C not ruled out, but rare)

The most common word among these is ""FLUTE"". Let me check:
- _ L _ _ _ ✓
- Contains T and E ✓
- Doesn't use S or A ✓
- E not in position 5 ✓

""FLUTE"" seems like a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE)
- L is correct in position 2.
- T is somewhere but not in position 3.
- E is somewhere but not in position 5.
- S, A are absent.

Round 2 (FLUTE)
- F is correct in position 1.
- L is again correct in position 2.
- U is absent.
- T is again somewhere but not in position 3 or 4.
- E is again somewhere but not in position 5.

So far we have:
Pattern: F L _ _ _
Letters still to place: T, E
Available positions left: 3, 4, 5
Constraints:
- T cannot be in 3 or 4 (from SLATE and FLUTE), so T must be in 5.
- E cannot be in 5 (from SLATE and FLUTE), so E must be in 3 or 4.
- U, S, A are absent.
- No repeats of F or L.

Therefore the word looks like:
F L E T _  or  F L _ E T
But we know T must be in position 5, so:
F L _ E T
Only position 3 is open; it must be a consonant not yet used (not S, A, U, F, L, T, E).

Common consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Words that fit F L _ E T:
- FLEET (but second E would repeat, and T already placed at 5)
- FLRET (not a word)
- FLBET (not a word)
- FLNET (not a word)
- FLGET (not a word)
- FLYET (not a word)
- FLDET (not a word)
- FLMET (not a word)

Wait, let me double-check the constraints:
T must be in position 5 (only remaining spot allowed).
E must be in 3 or 4. If T is in 5, then E must be in 3 or 4.

So possible patterns:
F L E _ T  or  F L _ E T

Looking at common English words:
- FLEET – but this has two E's, second E in position 4, which is allowed, but we don't know about duplicates yet.
- FLEFT (not a word)
- FLERT (not a word)
- FLENT (not a word)

Actually, the only common 5-letter word fitting F L _ _ T with T at 5 is:
FLEET

But ""fleet"" has two E's. Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicates. Let's try it.

Check constraints:
- F in 1 ✓
- L in 2 ✓
- T in 5 ✓
- E in 3 or 4 ✓ (here E is in 3 and 4, but position 3 is allowed for E)
- No S, A, U ✓

So ""FLEET"" is a valid next guess.

Based on the feedback:
- Position 1: F ✓
- Position 2: L ✓
- T is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 ⇒ it must be in position 5.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 ⇒ it must be in position 3 or 4.
