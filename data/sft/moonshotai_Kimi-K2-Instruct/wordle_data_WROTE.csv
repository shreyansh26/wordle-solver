For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to gather as much information as possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

One of the most strategic starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters in positions where they often appear.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are both in the correct positions (✓), so word ends with …TE.

Remaining unknown letters (positions 1, 2, 3) must be chosen from unused letters.  
Since vowels A and E are handled, the first three letters likely include other vowels (I, O, U, Y) plus common consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good next word should:
- Keep T and E fixed in positions 4 and 5.
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels in positions 1, 2, 3.
- Avoid S, L, A.

A strong candidate is “RECT”. However, that’s only 4 letters. We need 5 letters with T and E fixed at the end. So we can try “WRITE”, but W and R are common, I is a useful vowel, and WRITE has T and E in the correct spots.

Wait, WRITE: T is 4th, E is 5th. Let’s test it against feedback:
- Positions 4 and 5: T and E are correct, so WRITE respects that.
- Letters W, R, I are new and untested.

Thus, WRITE is a solid second guess that keeps T and E fixed, introduces W, R, I.

Another option is “CRITE” (C, R, I), but CRITE is not a valid word. So WRITE is better.

Therefore, the next guess should be WRITE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The correct pattern so far is: W R _ T E
2. The letters NOT in the word are: S, L, A (from round 1) and I (from round 2).  
   The letters that ARE in the word and already placed are: W, R, T, E.

We only need to find the single missing letter in the third position.

The remaining middle letter must be one that:
- Has not appeared in any prior feedback (so not S, L, A, I).
- Keeps the result a valid 5-letter English word of the form W R ? T E.

Common consonants still unused that fit in the third slot: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

- WRBTE → no such word
- WRCET — no
