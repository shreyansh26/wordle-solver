Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. In this situation, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities at once. Common starting words include those with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). This will give us good information about which letters are present and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- T(x): T is NOT in the word at all.  
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S, L, A somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4 or 1 (but not their original positions).
- It does NOT contain T.

Next, we want a new word that:
- Keeps E fixed in the 5th spot.
- Moves S, L, A to new possible positions.
- Introduces other common letters (like R, N, D, O, etc.) to test new letters.

A good second guess that accomplishes this is “RENAL”:
- R – new letter to test.
- E – already known to be in 5th spot, so here it’s in 2nd (safe to test since we know E is only in 5th).
- N – new letter.
- A – already known to be in word (now in 4th).
- L – already known to be in word (now in 5th, but 5th is E, so this is invalid; wait, this conflicts).

Oops, conflict: E must stay in 5th place, so any guess must have E in 5th. Let’s try “SNARE”:
- S – moves to 1st (original was 1st, feedback was “-” so can’t be 1st again → conflict).
Not valid.

Next candidate: “CRANE” (but E must be 5th, so invalid).

Valid word keeping E in 5th and testing new positions for S, L, A: “REALS”:
- R – new letter.
- E – 2nd (but must be 5th) → invalid.

Another: “LEANS”:
- L – 1st (original was 2nd, move allowed).
- E – 2nd (must be 5th) → invalid.

Correct form: must have E in 5th. So let’s try “SABLE”:
- S – 1st (original was 1st, feedback “-” so conflict, can’t be 1st again).
Invalid.

How about “BLASE”:
- B – new letter.
- L – 2nd (original was 2nd, feedback “-” so can’t be 2nd).
Invalid.

Next: “PEALS”:
- P – new letter.
- E – 2nd (must be 5th).
Invalid.

Proper candidate: must have E in 5th, test other letters. Try “AROSE”:
- A – 1st (original 3rd, feedback “-” so allowed).
- R – new.
- O – new.
- S – 4th (original 1st, feedback “-” so allowed).
- E – 5th (known correct).

This fits all constraints:
- Contains A, S, L (but L isn’t here – mistake).
Actually we need to include L. So adjust.

Best fit: “LASER”:
- L – 1st (original 2nd, allowed).
- A – 2nd (original 3rd, allowed).
- S – 3rd (original 1st, allowed).
- E – 4th (must be 5th) → invalid.

Correct form: E must be 5th. So “LASER” is invalid.

Next: “ALDER”:
- A – 1st (allowed).
- L – 2nd (original 2nd, feedback “-” so can’t be 2nd) → invalid.

Next: “SALVE”:
- S – 1st (original 1st, feedback “-” so can’t be 1st) → invalid.

Next: “SHALE”:
- S – 1st (invalid as above).

Next: “LEAPS”:
- E – 2nd (must be 5th) → invalid.

Correct word must have E in 5th and test S, L, A in new positions. Best candidate: “PEALS” adjusted to “PEALS” is invalid.

Finally: “LAPSE”:
- L – 1st (original 2nd, allowed).
- A – 2nd (original 3rd, allowed).
- P – new letter.
- S – 4th (original 1st, allowed).
- E – 5th (correct).

This fits:
- L is in 1st (original 2nd).
- A is in 2nd (original 3rd).
- S is in 4th (original 1st).
- E is fixed in 5th.
- Introduces P.

So the next guess is LAPSE.
