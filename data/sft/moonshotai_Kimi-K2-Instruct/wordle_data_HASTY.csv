For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A common strategy is to use words that contain frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"", I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly.

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start eliminating or confirming positions efficiently.

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the secret word (and at least one of their positions):
- A – definitely in position 2
- S – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (so S must be in position 3)
- T – in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (so T must be in position 1, 2, or 4)
- H – in the word but NOT in position 4 (so H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, E, I, N, P

Therefore the word has the fixed pattern:
_ A S _ _     (because S must be in position 3)

Now distribute T and H into the remaining blanks under their constraints:
- T can go in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5 already)
- H can go in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3 already)
- T and H must be in different positions.

Case 1: T in 1 and H in 4 → T A S H _
Case 2: T in 1 and H in 5 → T A S _ H
Case 3: T in 4 and H in 1 → H A S T _
Case 4: T in 4 and H in 5 → _ A S T H

We now test which of these patterns forms common 5-letter English words using only the still-allowed letters (no R,O,E,I,N,P).

Candidate words:
- T A S H _ → TASHY (Y allowed) – but TASHY is uncommon.
- T A S _ H → possible: TASCH? (C allowed) – but not an English word.
- H A S T _ → HASTE (E is forbidden) – fails.
- _ A S T H → possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   – BASTH, CASTH, DASTH, FASTH, GASTH, KASTH, LASTH, MASTH, VASTH, WASTH, YASTH
   – Among these, only LASTH and BASTH are not real words, but VASTH/BASTH are invalid.
   – However, “BASTH” is not a valid word.
   – “MASTH” is not valid either.
   – “FASTH” is not valid.
   – “WASTH” is archaic (“wast” + h) – not standard.
   – “VASTH” is not a word.

Let me reconsider the placements more carefully.

T must be in position 1 or 4.
H must be in any of 1,4,5.

Re-examine possible combinations:

1. T A S H _ – we need a valid 5th letter that is not forbidden and forms a word.
   T A S H Y – TASHY (valid adjective meaning “tasteless”) – but uncommon.
   T A S H A – not 5 letters.
   T A S H K – not valid.
   T A S H M – not valid.

2. T A S _ H – 4th letter: must be one of the allowed letters.
   T A S C H – TASCH? Not a word.
   T A S L H – not valid.
   T A S M H – not valid.

3. H A S T _ – 5th letter: must be allowed.
   H A S T Y – HASTY (E is forbidden, so “HASTY” is invalid because Y is allowed, but E is not present – wait HASTY’s letters: H,A,S,T,Y – all allowed. So HASTY is valid and satisfies constraints:
   H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).

4. _ A S T H – 1st letter: must be allowed and forms a word.
   B A S T H – invalid
   C A S T H – invalid
   D A S T H – invalid
   G A S T H – invalid
   K A S T H – invalid
   L A S T H – invalid
   M A S T H – invalid
   V A S T H – invalid
   W A S T H – invalid
   Y A S T H – invalid

So the only valid candidate meeting all constraints is HASTY.

Therefore, the next guess should be HASTY.
