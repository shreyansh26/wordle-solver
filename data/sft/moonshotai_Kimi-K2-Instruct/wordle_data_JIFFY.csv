Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I need to choose a strong starting word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters and good letter distribution. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because:
- It contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- It has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters appear frequently in English 5-letter words
This will help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

The feedback tells us that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all. Since this eliminates five very common letters, we need to pivot to a word that uses entirely different letters.

My next step is to pick a word made of letters that were NOT in the first guess. Good candidates should contain:
- Letters not yet tested (so avoid C,R,A,N,E)
- A good mix of common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants
- High-frequency letters like S, T, L, D, M, etc.

A strong next choice is ""SOUND"" because:
- S, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- Contains two new vowels (O, U)

From the combined feedback:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
2. LIGHT → only the letter I is present and in the correct position 2.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ I _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, T

That leaves us with the remaining consonants: B, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
and vowels: O, U (since I is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with one of the remaining consonants
- Has I in position 2
- Ends with three letters chosen from the remaining pool
- Must be a valid English word

Good candidates: B, D, F, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y can start the word, and we can try common patterns.

Looking at the remaining letters, ""S"" is very common, so let’s try ""S I _ _ _"". The remaining letters after S, I should pick from B, D, F, K, M, P, U, O, etc.

Possible words: SIXTH (but H and T are banned), SIMPS (not a word), SICKS (repeats S and K), SIKHS (H banned).

Another angle: ""F I _ _ _"". Possible: FISTS (S appears twice, T banned), FIFTH (H, T banned), FILMS (L banned).

""D I _ _ _"": DIXIE (but X is allowed, but E is banned), DIVOT (T banned), DIMPS (not a word).

From all feedback so far:

- Letters definitely absent: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, T, W, S, P  
  (12 letters ruled out)

- Pattern confirmed: _ I _ _ Y  
  (positions 2 and 5 are correct, with letters I and Y)

Remaining usable letters (alphabet minus the 12 banned ones):

B D F J K M O Q U V X Z

We need 3 more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are among the remaining pool,
- form a valid English word with the fixed pattern _ I _ _ Y.

Let’s search the dictionary for **?I??Y** words limited to those letters:

- **D I M M Y** – invalid
- **D I C K Y** – C is banned
- **B I K I Y** – invalid
- **B I L L Y** – L is banned
- **V I M M Y** – invalid

- **D I V O Y** – not a word
- **J I V Y** – too short
- **B I D D Y** – not standard
- **B I K I N Y** – too long
- **J I M M Y** – J, I, M, M, Y all allowed and is a valid word.

“JIMMY” fits every rule:

- Matches the pattern _ I _ _ Y.

Hence JIMMY is a perfect next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters and good letter distribution. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because:
- It contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- It has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters appear frequently in English 5-letter words
This will help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

My next step is to pick a word made of letters that were NOT in the first guess. Good candidates should contain:
- Letters not yet tested (so avoid C,R,A,N,E)
- A good mix of common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants
- High-frequency letters like S, T, L, D, M, etc.

A strong next choice is ""SOUND"" because:
- S, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- Contains two new vowels (O, U)
- Contains three common consonants (S, N, D) - though N was already eliminated, so I need to pick something else.

Wait, N was already used - let me correct. A better word would be ""LIGHT"" because:

2. LIGHT → only the letter I is present and in the correct position 2.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ I _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, L, G, H, T

That leaves us with the remaining consonants: B, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
and vowels: O, U (since I is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with one of the remaining consonants
- Has I in position 2
- Ends with three letters chosen from the remaining pool
- Must be a valid English word

Good candidates: B, D, F, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y can start the word, and we can try common patterns.

Looking at the remaining letters, ""S"" is very common, so let’s try ""S I _ _ _"". The remaining letters after S, I should pick from B, D, F, K, M, P, U, O, etc.

Possible words: SIXTH (but H and T are banned), SIMPS (not a word), SICKS (repeats S and K), SIKHS (H banned).

Another angle: ""F I _ _ _"". Possible: FISTS (S appears twice, T banned), FIFTH (H, T banned), FILMS (L banned).

""D I _ _ _"": DIXIE (but X is allowed, but E is banned), DIVOT (T banned), DIMPS (not a word).

""V I _ _ _"": VISTA (S, T, A banned), VINYL (N, L banned).

""W I _ _ _"": WISPY (S, P, Y allowed), but Y is allowed. WISPY is a valid word.
