When making a first guess in Wordle, we want to maximize the information gained by choosing a word that tests common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, we have: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first word should contain several of these. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (uses A,R,O,S,E)
- ""SLATE"" (S,L,A,T,E)
- ""CRANE"" (C,R,A,N,E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 4 vowels (A,O,E) and one very common consonant (S,R), covering a lot of ground for the first guess.

Another common word is ""TERNE"" but E repeats. ""INERT"" is also good but R is in 4th (allowed) and E in 3rd (allowed).

- N must not be in position 2 (from INERT). So N ∈ {1,3,4,5}.

We need a 5-letter word that includes R, E, I, N and one new letter. Let’s pick a consonant that hasn’t been tried yet, say C.

The word must be some permutation of {R, E, I, N, C} satisfying the positional constraints.

One good candidate is “NICER”.

Check:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- C (new letter)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

Let’s tabulate everything we know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word: R, E, I, N  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, C  

Thus the secret word must be some permutation of R, E, I, N plus one more letter (call it X).  
But every position has now been ruled out for every one of these four letters:

- N: cannot be in position 1 (NICER feedback), 2 (INERT feedback) → N must be in 3, 4, or 5  
- I: cannot be in position 1 (INERT), 2 (NICER) → I must be in 3, 4, or 5  
- C: not in the word at all → already discarded  
- E: cannot be in position 5 (AROSE), 3 (INERT), 4 (NICER) → E must be in 1 or 2  
- R: cannot be in position 2 (AROSE), 4 (INERT), 5 (NICER) → R must be in 1 or 3  

We only have four letters so far: R, E, I, N.  
We need a fifth letter.  The set of unused, still-possible letters is  
{D, L, U, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, W, Y}.

Any valid permutation must simultaneously satisfy the positional constraints above.  
Let’s look for a straightforward word that keeps the four known letters and adds one new consonant.

A promising candidate is “REIGN”:
- R in 1 (OK)  
- E in 2 (OK)  
- I in 3 (OK)  
- G (new letter)  
- N in 5 (OK)

All constraints are met.
