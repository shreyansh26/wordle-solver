Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy for the initial guess is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

- R – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- O – not in the word (x)  
- S – not in the word (x)  
- E – in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word must contain R and E, but neither is in its guessed spot (R is not #2, E is not #5).  
2. The letters A, O, S are completely out.  
3. We still have 3 unknown positions (#1, #3, #4) and need to place R and E somewhere besides their old spots.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, H, D, B, F, G, M, P, etc.  
Vowels left to try: I, U (because A and O are eliminated, E is already known to be present).

A balanced second guess that repositions R and E while introducing new common letters is “INERT”.
- I, N, T are new letters and high-frequency.  
- E and R are reused but placed in new positions (#3 and #4 respectively), satisfying the feedback.

Let’s condense what the two clues have told us so far.

Letters definitely OUT: A, O, S, T, N, I  
Letters definitely IN but whose positions we still have to pin down: R, E  
We also have no information yet on several common consonants (D, H, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, U) and two vowels (U, Y is sometimes used as a vowel).

Positions we still know nothing about: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 (the only solid fact is that R and E must sit somewhere in the word, and neither is in the spots we already tested).

A good third guess tries to place R and E in brand-new positions while flooding the remaining three slots with letters we have never tested yet.  
The consonants D, L, H, C, M, P, B, G, F, K and the vowel U are still “virgin”.  
Among those, the combination “U”, “C”, “H”, “D”, “L”, “M”, “P”, “B”, “G”, “F”, “K” gives several high-frequency choices.

Let’s try a word that uses two new consonants, the vowel U, and puts R and E in spots we have not yet tried.

Candidate: PERCH  
- P, C, H are completely new letters.  
- U is not used, but the letters P, C, H are more common.  
- R moves to position #2 (never tried before).  
- E moves to position #1 (never tried before).  
This satisfies every constraint we have so far.

Let’s list what we now know after three guesses:

Letters that are OUT of the word (x):  
A, O, S, T, N, I, P, C, H

Letters that are IN the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know:  
- E is in the word AND is in position #2 (from PERCH feedback).  
- R is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (because in AROSE, INERT and PERCH it was marked “-” when it appeared in those spots). Therefore R must be in position #1 or #5.

So far the word looks like:  
? E ? ? ?  or  ? ? ? E ?  or  ? ? ? ? E, but E is confirmed at spot 2, so pattern is:  
_ E _ _ _

and R must be in slot #1 or #5.

Letters still allowed: U, D, L, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, and of course R and E.

We need three more letters (positions 3, 4, 5) chosen only from the still-allowed set, while respecting that R must be at #1 or #5.

A quick way to test several unused letters at once is to build a word that fixes E at #2 and puts R at #1 (so we can see if R belongs there), and fills the remaining three slots with fresh, common letters.

Candidate: R E U D G  
→ “REUDG” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: R E B U D → “REBUD” invalid.

Try: R E L U D → “RELUD” invalid.

Try: R E L I C → I and C are already ruled out.

Try: R E L D U → “RELDU” invalid.

Try: R E L D Y → “RELDY” invalid.

Try: R E L D S → S is ruled out.

Try: R E L D B → “REBUD” again invalid.

Try: R E G U D → “REGUD” invalid.

We need a dictionary-valid word. The only valid English word I can see that fits the pattern “R E _ _ _” and uses currently allowed letters is:

R E B U T (but T is out)  
R E L I C (I and C are out)  
R E L U D (invalid)  
R E B U D (invalid)  
R E G U D (invalid)

Instead, let’s try the other possibility: R is at #5, E is fixed at #2, and we fill slots 1, 3, 4 with new letters.

Pattern: _ E _ _ R

Letters still allowed: U, D, L, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, R, E.

We need three consonants or the vowel U to fill slots 1-3-4.

Valid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ _ R:

- D E B U R – invalid (B, U, R ok, but word is “DEBUR” which is not common).  
- F E L D R – invalid.  
- G E L D R – invalid.  
- M E L D R – invalid.  
- B E G U R – invalid.  
- U (as slot 1) gives U E _ _ R – but “UEL..” is unlikely.

Let’s pick a real word:  
M E D L R – invalid.  
B E D L R – invalid.  
G E L D R – invalid.

The only common word I can spot is:

B U R E N – no, that moves E.

Wait – how about:  
B E G U R – invalid.

Look again at the allowed letters: we still have D, L, U, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y.

A valid word that uses three of them and keeps the pattern _ E _ _ R is:

F E V E R – but V was never ruled out, and E is already known at 2, R at 5.  
But V and F are still allowed, and the word is valid: FEVER.

Check:  
F – still allowed.  
E – known to be at 2.  
V – still allowed.  
E – duplicate but allowed.  
R – known to be in the word and now at 5.

So “FEVER” perfectly fits every known constraint:
- Pattern _ E _ _ R  
- Letters F, V have never been guessed before.  
- No disallowed letters.

Therefore the next guess is FEVER.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,REIGN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy for the initial guess is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

So we know:
1. The word must contain R and E, but neither is in its guessed spot (R is not #2, E is not #5).  
2. The letters A, O, S are completely out.  
3. We still have 3 unknown positions (#1, #3, #4) and need to place R and E somewhere besides their old spots.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, H, D, B, F, G, M, P, etc.  
Vowels left to try: I, U (because A and O are eliminated, E is already known to be present).

A balanced second guess that repositions R and E while introducing new common letters is “INERT”.
- I, N, T are new letters and high-frequency.  
- E and R are reused but placed in new positions (#3 and #4 respectively), satisfying the feedback.

Letters definitely OUT: A, O, S, T, N, I  
Letters definitely IN but whose positions we still have to pin down: R, E  
We also have no information yet on several common consonants (D, H, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, U) and two vowels (U, Y is sometimes used as a vowel).

Positions we still know nothing about: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 (the only solid fact is that R and E must sit somewhere in the word, and neither is in the spots we already tested).

A good third guess tries to place R and E in brand-new positions while flooding the remaining three slots with letters we have never tested yet.  
The consonants D, L, H, C, M, P, B, G, F, K and the vowel U are still “virgin”.  
Among those, the combination “U”, “C”, “H”, “D”, “L”, “M”, “P”, “B”, “G”, “F”, “K” gives several high-frequency choices.

Let’s try a word that uses two new consonants, the vowel U, and puts R and E in spots we have not yet tried.

Candidate: PERCH  
- P, C, H are completely new letters.  
- U is not used, but the letters P, C, H are more common.  
- R moves to position #2 (never tried before).  
- E moves to position #1 (never tried before).

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters permanently OUT:  
A, O, S, T, N, I, P, C, H, F, V

Letters we are sure are IN the word:  
E, R

Position facts we have:
- E is confirmed at position #2 (✓ from PERCH).
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it was marked “-” in all those spots across the four guesses).  
  Therefore R **must** be in position #1.

So the word pattern is:  
R E _ _ _

Letters still allowed for the three remaining blanks:  
U, D, L, M, B, G, K, W, Y, plus any repeats of E (but E is already placed at #2).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form “RE _ _ _” using only the still-allowed letters.

Quick scan of common “RE…” words:

- REBEL – B, E, L all still allowed.  
- REDUX – D, U, X (X is untested, but “REDUX” is a valid word and X has never been ruled out).  
- REGAL – G, A, L; but A is OUT.  
- RELAY – L, A, Y; A is OUT.  
- REMIX – M, I, X; I is OUT.  
- REBID – B, I, D; I is OUT.  
- REBUT – B, U, T; T is OUT.  
- REBEL is clean: B, E (again), L.

Testing REBEL:
- R – must be #1 ✓  
- E – #2 ✓  
- B – untested so far  
- E – allowed to appear again  
- L – untested so far

All letters used are still in the “allowed” set, so it satisfies every constraint.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,REIGN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy for the initial guess is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap for AROSE:
- A – not in the word (x)  
- R – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- O – not in the word (x)  
- S – not in the word (x)  
- E – in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word must contain R and E, but neither is in its guessed spot (R is not #2, E is not #5).  
2. The letters A, O, S are completely out.  
3. We still have 3 unknown positions (#1, #3, #4) and need to place R and E somewhere besides their old spots.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, H, D, B, F, G, M, P, etc.  
Vowels left to try: I, U (because A and O are eliminated, E is already known to be present).

A balanced second guess that repositions R and E while introducing new common letters is “INERT”.
- I, N, T are new letters and high-frequency.  
- E and R are reused but placed in new positions (#3 and #4 respectively), satisfying the feedback.

Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s condense what the two clues have told us so far.

Letters definitely OUT: A, O, S, T, N, I  
Letters definitely IN but whose positions we still have to pin down: R, E  
We also have no information yet on several common consonants (D, H, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, U) and two vowels (U, Y is sometimes used as a vowel).

Positions we still know nothing about: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 (the only solid fact is that R and E must sit somewhere in the word, and neither is in the spots we already tested).

A good third guess tries to place R and E in brand-new positions while flooding the remaining three slots with letters we have never tested yet.  
The consonants D, L, H, C, M, P, B, G, F, K and the vowel U are still “virgin”.  
Among those, the combination “U”, “C”, “H”, “D”, “L”, “M”, “P”, “B”, “G”, “F”, “K” gives several high-frequency choices.

Let’s try a word that uses two new consonants, the vowel U, and puts R and E in spots we have not yet tried.

Candidate: PERCH  
- P, C, H are completely new letters.  
- U is not used, but the letters P, C, H are more common.  
- R moves to position #2 (never tried before).  
- E moves to position #1 (never tried before).  
This satisfies every constraint we have so far.

Guess 3: PERCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list what we now know after three guesses:

Letters that are OUT of the word (x):  
A, O, S, T, N, I, P, C, H

Letters that are IN the word but whose exact positions we still don’t know:  
- E is in the word AND is in position #2 (from PERCH feedback).  
- R is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (because in AROSE, INERT and PERCH it was marked “-” when it appeared in those spots). Therefore R must be in position #1 or #5.

So far the word looks like:  
? E ? ? ?  or  ? ? ? E ?  or  ? ? ? ? E, but E is confirmed at spot 2, so pattern is:  
_ E _ _ _

and R must be in slot #1 or #5.

Letters still allowed: U, D, L, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, and of course R and E.

We need three more letters (positions 3, 4, 5) chosen only from the still-allowed set, while respecting that R must be at #1 or #5.

A quick way to test several unused letters at once is to build a word that fixes E at #2 and puts R at #1 (so we can see if R belongs there), and fills the remaining three slots with fresh, common letters.

Candidate: R E U D G  
→ “REUDG” is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: R E B U D → “REBUD” invalid.

Try: R E L U D → “RELUD” invalid.

Try: R E L I C → I and C are already ruled out.

Try: R E L D U → “RELDU” invalid.

Try: R E L D Y → “RELDY” invalid.

Try: R E L D S → S is ruled out.

Try: R E L D B → “REBUD” again invalid.

Try: R E G U D → “REGUD” invalid.

We need a dictionary-valid word. The only valid English word I can see that fits the pattern “R E _ _ _” and uses currently allowed letters is:

R E B U T (but T is out)  
R E L I C (I and C are out)  
R E L U D (invalid)  
R E B U D (invalid)  
R E G U D (invalid)

Instead, let’s try the other possibility: R is at #5, E is fixed at #2, and we fill slots 1, 3, 4 with new letters.

Pattern: _ E _ _ R

Letters still allowed: U, D, L, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, R, E.

We need three consonants or the vowel U to fill slots 1-3-4.

Valid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ _ R:

- D E B U R – invalid (B, U, R ok, but word is “DEBUR” which is not common).  
- F E L D R – invalid.  
- G E L D R – invalid.  
- M E L D R – invalid.  
- B E G U R – invalid.  
- U (as slot 1) gives U E _ _ R – but “UEL..” is unlikely.

Let’s pick a real word:  
M E D L R – invalid.  
B E D L R – invalid.  
G E L D R – invalid.

The only common word I can spot is:

B U R E N – no, that moves E.

Wait – how about:  
B E G U R – invalid.

Look again at the allowed letters: we still have D, L, U, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y.

A valid word that uses three of them and keeps the pattern _ E _ _ R is:

F E V E R – but V was never ruled out, and E is already known at 2, R at 5.  
But V and F are still allowed, and the word is valid: FEVER.

Check:  
F – still allowed.  
E – known to be at 2.  
V – still allowed.  
E – duplicate but allowed.  
R – known to be in the word and now at 5.

So “FEVER” perfectly fits every known constraint:
- Pattern _ E _ _ R  
- Letters F, V have never been guessed before.  
- No disallowed letters.

Therefore the next guess is FEVER.

The only valid English word I can see that fits the pattern “R E _ _ _” and uses currently allowed letters is:\n\nR E B U T (but T is out)  \nR E L I C (I and C are out)  \nR E L U D (invalid)  \nR E B U D (invalid)  \nR E G U D (invalid)\n\nInstead, let’s try the other possibility: R is at #5, E is fixed at #2, and we fill slots 1, 3, 4 with new letters.\n\nPattern: _ E _ _ R\n\nLetters still allowed: U, D, L, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, R, E.\n\nWe need three consonants or the vowel U to fill slots 1-3-4.\n\nValid 5-letter words that fit _ E _ _ R:\n\n- D E B U R – invalid (B, U, R ok, but word is “DEBUR” which is not common).  \n- F E L D R – invalid.  \n- G E L D R – invalid.  \n- M E L D R – invalid.  \n- B E G U R – invalid.  \n- U (as slot 1) gives U E _ _ R – but “UEL..” is unlikely.\n\nLet’s pick a real word:  \nM E D L R – invalid.  \nB E D L R – invalid.  \nG E L D R – invalid.\n\nThe only common word I can spot is:\n\nB U R E N – no, that moves E.\n\nWait – how about:  \nB E G U R – invalid.\n\nLook again at the allowed letters: we still have D, L, U, M, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y.\n\nA valid word that uses three of them and keeps the pattern _ E _ _ R is:\n\nF E V E R – but V was never ruled out, and E is already known at 2, R at 5.  \nBut V and F are still allowed, and the word is valid: FEVER.\n\nCheck:  \nF – still allowed.  \nE – known to be at 2.  \nV – still allowed.  \nE – duplicate but allowed.  \nR – known to be in the word and now at 5.\n\nSo “FEVER” perfectly fits every known constraint:\n- Pattern _ E _ _ R  \n- Letters F, V have never been guessed before.  \n- No disallowed letters.\n\nTherefore the next guess is FEVER.\n\n<guess>FEVER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: PERCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(-) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: FEVER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) V(x) E(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary of everything we now know:\n\nLetters permanently OUT:  \nA, O, S, T, N, I, P, C, H, F, V\n\nLetters we are sure are IN the word:  \nE, R\n\nPosition facts we have:\n- E is confirmed at position #2 (✓ from PERCH).\n- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (because it was marked “-” in all those spots across the four guesses).  \n  Therefore R **must** be in position #1.\n\nSo the word pattern is:  \nR E _ _ _\n\nLetters still allowed for the three remaining blanks:  \nU, D, L, M, B, G, K, W, Y, plus any repeats of E (but E is already placed at #2).\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter English word of the form “RE _ _ _” using only the still-allowed letters.\n\nQuick scan of common “RE…” words:\n\n- REBEL – B, E, L all still allowed.  \n- REDUX – D, U, X (X is untested, but “REDUX” is a valid word and X has never been ruled out).  \n- REGAL – G, A, L; but A is OUT.  \n- RELAY – L, A, Y; A is OUT.  \n- REMIX – M, I, X; I is OUT.  \n- REBID – B, I, D; I is OUT.  \n- REBUT – B, U, T; T is OUT.  \n- REBEL is clean: B, E (again), L.\n\nTesting REBEL:\n- R – must be #1 ✓  \n- E – #2 ✓  \n- B – untested so far  \n- E – allowed to appear again  \n- L – untested so far\n\nAll letters used are still in the “allowed” set, so it satisfies every constraint.\n\n<guess>REBEL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: PERCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(-) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: FEVER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) V(x) E(-) R(-)\nGuess 5: REBEL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
Current constraints after five guesses:

1. Letters OUT: A, O, S, T, N, I, P, C, H, F, V, B, L  
   (from the x marks in all previous feedback)

2. Letters IN:  
   - R must be in position #1 (only spot never marked “-” for R) – confirmed ✓ in REBEL  
   - E must be in position #2 – confirmed ✓ in REBEL  
   - E also appears a second time somewhere, but **not** in position 4 (because the second E in REBEL was marked “-”).  
     Therefore the second E can only be in position 3 or 5.

3. Remaining slots to fill: positions 3, 4, 5  
   Allowed letters not yet ruled out: U, D, G, K, M, W, Y, plus maybe J, Q, X, Z (though rare).

4. Must form a valid 5-letter English word with pattern:  
   R E _ _ _   
   with an additional E in either position 3 or 5, and the remaining letters from the allowed set.

Search for real words:

- R E E _ _ :  
  REED_ – REEDY (Y allowed) – but D is allowed too, let’s check.  
  REEDY  – letters R,E,E,D,Y. All letters are still un-eliminated.  
  This fits:  
  R ✓ (pos 1), E ✓ (pos 2), E (pos 3), D (pos 4), Y (pos 5).  
  Second E is in position 3 (never tested before), and D, Y have never been guessed.

- R E _ E _ :  
  R E D E R – D allowed, R already used once but can appear again; however “REDER” is not a common English word.  

- R E _ _ E :  
  R E L U E – L is out (already marked x).  
  R E G U E – “REGUE” not a valid word.  

The only clean, dictionary-valid choice that meets every constraint is:
