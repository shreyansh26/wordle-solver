- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, we have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a starting word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize the amount of information we can get from the feedback. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I think ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A exists in the secret word but is NOT in the 1st position.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E, but A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
2. The letters R, O, S are eliminated.
3. We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4) and need to place A and E somewhere other than positions 1 and 5 respectively.

A good next guess should:
- Include A and E in new positions.
- Avoid R, O, S.
- Introduce other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) to test fresh letters.

Let’s try ""EATEN"":
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E only can’t be in position 5).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in position 1).
- T, N are fresh consonants to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The secret word definitely contains A and E each exactly once (because in both guesses the same letters returned “-” indicating they are present but in the wrong positions; if either letter appeared twice we would have seen at least two “-” marks for it, but we did not).

2. Positions so far eliminated:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

3. Letters eliminated completely: R, O, S, T, N.

4. So far allowed positions:
   - A can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E can be in positions 2 or 3 (but not both, since each appears once).

5. We need three new consonants from the remaining common set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y}.

A good next guess should:
- Place A and E in still-allowed spots.
- Introduce three fresh consonants.
- Keep it a common five-letter word.

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and A in position 3, and pick three new consonants: C, L, B.

The word “CELAB” is invalid (not an English word). Instead, “BECAL” is archaic; “CABLE” is valid.  

Check positions:
- C (new)
- E (allowed in position 2)
- A (allowed in position 3)
- B (new)
- L (new)

This uses five distinct letters, satisfies all known constraints, and is a common word, so it’s a strong third guess.

So far we know:
1. The word contains exactly one A and one E.
2. Positions eliminated:
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - Letters eliminated: R, O, S, T, N, C, B, L.
3. Therefore:
   - A must be in position 4 or 5.
   - E must be in position 3 (since 1,2,4,5 are all ruled out).
   - We need three consonants from the remaining common set: {D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y}.

A good next guess should:
- Lock E into position 3.
- Place A into position 4 or 5.
- Test three fresh consonants.
A word like ""HEPAD"" isn't valid, but ""FAKED"" would fit: positions 3=E and 4=A, with F, K, D all untested and common. However, K is in position 3 and E is already forced there. Instead, let's try ""WAGED"": E in position 3, A in position 4, with W, G, D as new consonants. But that's invalid because A is in position 4 here. Let's try ""MADGE"": E would be in position 4, which is not allowed. Let's try ""GAMED"": E in position 3, A in position 4, G, M, D are all new consonants. This is valid and common.

Positions:

A (allowed in position 2? Wait, position 2 for A is disallowed from guess 2. So A must be 4 or 5, and E must be 3. So the word looks like _ _ E A _ or _ _ E _ A.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,heavy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a starting word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize the amount of information we can get from the feedback. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I think ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A exists in the secret word but is NOT in the 1st position.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) – E exists in the secret word but is NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E, but A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
2. The letters R, O, S are eliminated.
3. We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4) and need to place A and E somewhere other than positions 1 and 5 respectively.

A good next guess should:
- Include A and E in new positions.
- Avoid R, O, S.
- Introduce other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) to test fresh letters.

Let’s try ""EATEN"":
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E only can’t be in position 5).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in position 1).
- T, N are fresh consonants to test.

2. Positions so far eliminated:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

3. Letters eliminated completely: R, O, S, T, N.

4. So far allowed positions:
   - A can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E can be in positions 2 or 3 (but not both, since each appears once).

5. We need three new consonants from the remaining common set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y}.

A good next guess should:
- Place A and E in still-allowed spots.
- Introduce three fresh consonants.
- Keep it a common five-letter word.

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and A in position 3, and pick three new consonants: C, L, B.

The word “CELAB” is invalid (not an English word). Instead, “BECAL” is archaic; “CABLE” is valid.  

Check positions:
- C (new)
- E (allowed in position 2)
- A (allowed in position 3)
- B (new)
- L (new)

This uses five distinct letters, satisfies all known constraints, and is a common word, so it’s a strong third guess.
