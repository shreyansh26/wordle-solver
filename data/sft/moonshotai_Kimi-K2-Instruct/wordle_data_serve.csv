Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to go on. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. Common strategies include:
1. Using vowels to check their presence (A, E, I, O, U).
2. Including common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).
3. Avoiding rare letters (Q, Z, X) early on.

A widely recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because:
- S is a very common starting letter.
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters that appear in many words.
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T).

Alternative strong choices include ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" is one of the most optimal first guesses statistically.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.
- E is in the correct fifth position.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ _ E

Next, I want to test new letters in the middle three positions while keeping S and E fixed. Good candidates to try now are common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U) that haven’t been checked yet. A strong choice would be ""SHINE"" because:
- It keeps S and E fixed.
- Tests H, I, N in the middle positions (all common letters not yet tried).
- Uses no letters already ruled out (L, A, T).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, H, I, N
- Remaining vowels to test: O, U
- Common unused consonants: R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with E, and uses only the remaining allowed letters. Good middle-position candidates are R, O, U, C, D, etc.

Possible choices:
- SCORE (but O and R are still possible)
- SPOKE (but P, K are allowed)
- SUEDE (but U, D are allowed)
- SERVE (but R, V are allowed)

Among these, ""SUEDE"" seems strong because:
- Tests the vowel U in position 2
- Tests D in position 3
- Tests another E in position 4 (though E is already confirmed for position 5, this is acceptable as a test of other letters)

However, since the last position must be E, and we already have E there, we need to ensure the other letters are from allowed set. 

Actually a better choice is ""SORRY"" but that has double R which might not be ideal. Next better is ""STORE"" but T is ruled out.

Looking at the constraints again:
- S _ _ _ E
- Allowed middle letters: O, U, R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

Good candidates:
- SCORE (S C O R E) - tests O and R
- SPOKE (S P O K E) - tests P, O, K
- SUEDE (S U E D E) - but has E in 4th position which is allowed

But SUEDE has two E's which might not give maximum info. Better to try different letters.

Best appears to be ""SCORE"":
- Tests C, O, R in middle positions
- All letters are unused so far
- Valid word

Alternative ""SABLE"" but A and L are ruled out. ""SOWER"" tests O and W.

I think ""SCORE"" is most balanced.

Wait, is O tested yet? No, O wasn't in SLATE or SHINE. So ""SCORE"" is valid.

But let me check: S C O R E - all letters are new except S and E which are confirmed positions. This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

A widely recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because:
- S is a very common starting letter.
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters that appear in many words.
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T).

- S is in the correct first position.

- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ _ E

Next, I want to test new letters in the middle three positions while keeping S and E fixed. Good candidates to try now are common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U) that haven’t been checked yet. A strong choice would be ""SHINE"" because:
- It keeps S and E fixed.

- Uses no letters already ruled out (L, A, T).

- Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, H, I, N

- Common unused consonants: R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with E, and uses only the remaining allowed letters. Good middle-position candidates are R, O, U, C, D, etc.

Possible choices:
- SCORE (but O and R are still possible)
- SPOKE (but P, K are allowed)
- SUEDE (but U, D are allowed)
- SERVE (but R, V are allowed)

Among these, ""SUEDE"" seems strong because:
- Tests the vowel U in position 2
- Tests D in position 3
- Tests another E in position 4 (though E is already confirmed for position 5, this is acceptable as a test of other letters)

However, since the last position must be E, and we already have E there, we need to ensure the other letters are from allowed set. 

Actually a better choice is ""SORRY"" but that has double R which might not be ideal. Next better is ""STORE"" but T is ruled out.

Looking at the constraints again:
- S _ _ _ E
- Allowed middle letters: O, U, R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

Good candidates:
- SCORE (S C O R E) - tests O and R
- SPOKE (S P O K E) - tests P, O, K
- SUEDE (S U E D E) - but has E in 4th position which is allowed

But SUEDE has two E's which might not give maximum info. Better to try different letters.

Best appears to be ""SCORE"":
- Tests C, O, R in middle positions
- All letters are unused so far
- Valid word

Alternative ""SABLE"" but A and L are ruled out. ""SOWER"" tests O and W.

I think ""SCORE"" is most balanced.

Wait, is O tested yet? No, O wasn't in SLATE or SHINE. So ""SCORE"" is valid.

But let me check: S C O R E - all letters are new except S and E which are confirmed positions. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""SPIKE"" - tests P, I, K but I is already ruled out in SHINE.

- Tests H, I, N in the middle positions (all common letters not yet tried).
- Uses no letters already ruled out (L, A, T).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, H, I, N
- Remaining vowels to test: O, U
- Common unused consonants: R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with E, and uses only the remaining allowed letters. Good middle-position candidates are R, O, U, C, D, etc.

Possible choices:
- SCORE (but O and R are still possible)
- SPOKE (but P, K are allowed)
- SUEDE (but U, D are allowed)
- SERVE (but R, V are allowed)

Among these, ""SUEDE"" seems strong because:
- Tests the vowel U in position 2
- Tests D in position 3
- Tests another E in position 4 (though E is already confirmed for position 5, this is acceptable as a test of other letters)

However, since the last position must be E, and we already have E there, we need to ensure the other letters are from allowed set. 

Actually a better choice is ""SORRY"" but that has double R which might not be ideal. Next better is ""STORE"" but T is ruled out.

Looking at the constraints again:
- S _ _ _ E
- Allowed middle letters: O, U, R, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V

Good candidates:
- SCORE (S C O R E) - tests O and R
- SPOKE (S P O K E) - tests P, O, K
- SUEDE (S U E D E) - but has E in 4th position which is allowed

But SUEDE has two E's which might not give maximum info. Better to try different letters.

Best appears to be ""SCORE"":
- Tests C, O, R in middle positions
- All letters are unused so far
- Valid word

Alternative ""SABLE"" but A and L are ruled out. ""SOWER"" tests O and W.

I think ""SCORE"" is most balanced.

Wait, is O tested yet? No, O wasn't in SLATE or SHINE. So ""SCORE"" is valid.

But let me check: S C O R E - all letters are new except S and E which are confirmed positions. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""SPIKE"" - tests P, I, K but I is already ruled out in SHINE.

So ""SCORE"" is best.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters ruled OUT (x or -): L, A, T, H, I, N, C, O
- Letters confirmed (✓): S in 1st, E in 5th
- Letter with yellow mark (-): R (it appears in the word but is NOT in 4th position)

So the word must be S _ _ _ E and contain R somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (not 4).

Remaining unused letters (common ones): D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Ends with E
3. Has an R in position 2 or 3
4. Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- S R _ _ E (R in 2nd): S R O W E (but O is out), S R U G E (invalid), S R E E E (invalid)
- S _ R _ E (R in 3rd): S U R G E, S P R E E (but second E is invalid), S P R U E

Looking at valid words:
- SURGE (S U R G E) - R in 3rd position, all letters allowed
- SPRUE (S P R U E) - R in 3rd position, all letters allowed

Between these, ""SURGE"" is more common and uses G which hasn't been tested yet.

Another check: Are all letters in ""SURGE"" allowed?
- S (✓), U (not ruled out), R (confirmed present), G (not ruled out), E (✓) - yes.

""SURGE"" fits all constraints.

Letters eliminated so far:
L, A, T, H, I, N, C, O, U, G

Remaining unused letters (common):
D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y

We need a word matching S _ R _ E using only these letters in positions 2 and 4.

""SPREE"" is the only valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern with remaining allowed letters.
