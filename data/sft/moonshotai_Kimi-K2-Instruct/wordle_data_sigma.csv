For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words to maximize information gain
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some good first guesses include:
- CRANE (common letters C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ARISE (A,R,I,S,E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains very common letters (A,R,I,S,E) that appear in many words, and it has no repeating letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Let me step through what the feedback tells us:

1. A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in slot 1).
2. R(x): The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. I(-): The letter I is in the word but in the wrong position (not in slot 3).
4. S(-): The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not in slot 4).
5. E(x): The letter E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, I, S
- Letters that definitely do NOT appear: R, E  
- Positions for A, I, S that we can eliminate slot 1, slot 3, and slot 4 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, I, S (each once) and does not contain R or E. Also, A can’t be in slot 1, I can’t be in slot 3, and S can’t be in slot 4.

Possible remaining slots:
- A could be in 2, 4, or 5
- I could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5
- S could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Good candidates:
- SAINT (letters S,A,I,N,T; no R,E)
- SITAR (but contains R – invalid)
- STAIN (letters S,T,A,I,N)
- STAIR (contains R – invalid)
- SAINT and STAIN look best

I’ll choose SAINT because it spreads A, I, S across different positions and tests new letters N and T.

- Contains A and I somewhere in slots 2-5
- Uses none of R, E, N, T
- Has distinct letters (each once)

     – SIAGO (not a word)  
   - I in 4: S _ A I _  → e.g., S C A I L → SCAIL (not a word), S L A I D (D is okay) but SLAID is archaic.  
   - I in 5: S _ A _ I  → e.g., S P A C I → SPACI (not a word).  

Case 2: A in slot 4

   I must be in 2, 3, or 5.  
   - I in 2: S I _ A _  → e.g., S I D A L (SIDAL?) no.

   - I in 5: S _ _ A I  → e.g., S C U A I (SCUAI?) no.

Case 3: A in slot 5
