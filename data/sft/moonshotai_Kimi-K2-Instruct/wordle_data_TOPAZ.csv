For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters and is likely to provide useful information regardless of the actual secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has:
- Three common vowels (A, E)
- Three very common consonants (S, L, T)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage, so I'll go with that as my first guess.

The feedback from AROSE tells me:

- A appears in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O appears in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere other than position 1.
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Does not contain R, S, or E.

I need a new word that keeps A and O in different positions and introduces new common letters while avoiding R, S, and E. A good second guess should still use common letters but now focus on consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U).

Good candidates:
- ADOUB (but U is only in position 4 here)
- ALOUD (but L might be less common)
- AUDIO (has I and U, but O is still in position 3)
- TALON (but N is less common than other letters)

Looking at these, ""AUDIO"" seems best because:
1. It moves O to position 4 (which is allowed since O can't be in position 3)
2. It keeps A in position 1 (but since A can't be in position 1, this is actually a mistake - we know A must not be in position 1)
3. Actually ""AUDIO"" has O in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Let me pick a better word that moves A and O to allowed positions. ""TOXIC"" might work but has X which is less common. ""CLOUD"" is better but has no A. 

A better choice is ""AMONG"":
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it can't be position 1)
- O is in position 3 (but we know this is wrong - O can't be position 3)

Actually, looking back at positions:
- A can't be in position 1, so positions 2-5 are possible for A
- O can't be in position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O

A word like ""ADOPT"" would have O in position 2 (allowed) and A in position 1 (not allowed). 

Let me try ""COBIA"":
- C (new letter)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- A in position 5 (allowed)

But this might be too obscure. 

Looking at more common words: ""POINT"" has O in position 2 and I, N, T are common. But it lacks A.

Actually, the best approach is to move both A and O to new positions while introducing new common letters. ""ACORN"" is bad because it has R. 

""ABOUT"" seems best:
- A in position 1 (but we know this is wrong - A can't be position 1)

I need to carefully pick a word where:
- A is in positions 2-5
- O is in positions 1,2,4, or 5
- No R, S, or E

A good choice is ""COBRA"" but that has R. 

""CLOAK"" has A in position 4 (good), O in position 2 (good), and common letters C, L, K. But K is less common.

""FLOAT"" has A in 4 (good), O in 2 (good), but has T which wasn't ruled out but is new. However it has F and L which are less common.

Actually, ""COBIA"" might be the best available option that satisfies all constraints, even if slightly obscure.

But let me think simpler: since we know A and O must appear but not in their original positions, and we need new common consonants. The remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D. 

""ATOLL"" has A in position 1 (wrong). ""TALON"" has A in position 2 (good), O in position 4 (good), T N common consonants.

This seems optimal: TALON
- T (new)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- L (new)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- N (new)

Based on the feedback:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters and is likely to provide useful information regardless of the actual secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has:
- Three common vowels (A, E)
- Three very common consonants (S, L, T)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage, so I'll go with that as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells me:

- A appears in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O appears in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere other than position 1.
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Does not contain R, S, or E.

I need a new word that keeps A and O in different positions and introduces new common letters while avoiding R, S, and E. A good second guess should still use common letters but now focus on consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U).

Good candidates:
- ADOUB (but U is only in position 4 here)
- ALOUD (but L might be less common)
- AUDIO (has I and U, but O is still in position 3)
- TALON (but N is less common than other letters)

Looking at these, ""AUDIO"" seems best because:
1. It moves O to position 4 (which is allowed since O can't be in position 3)
2. It keeps A in position 1 (but since A can't be in position 1, this is actually a mistake - we know A must not be in position 1)
3. Actually ""AUDIO"" has O in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Let me pick a better word that moves A and O to allowed positions. ""TOXIC"" might work but has X which is less common. ""CLOUD"" is better but has no A. 

A better choice is ""AMONG"":
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it can't be position 1)
- O is in position 3 (but we know this is wrong - O can't be position 3)

Actually, looking back at positions:
- A can't be in position 1, so positions 2-5 are possible for A
- O can't be in position 3, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for O

A word like ""ADOPT"" would have O in position 2 (allowed) and A in position 1 (not allowed). 

Let me try ""COBIA"":
- C (new letter)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- A in position 5 (allowed)

But this might be too obscure. 

Looking at more common words: ""POINT"" has O in position 2 and I, N, T are common. But it lacks A.

Actually, the best approach is to move both A and O to new positions while introducing new common letters. ""ACORN"" is bad because it has R. 

""ABOUT"" seems best:
- A in position 1 (but we know this is wrong - A can't be position 1)

I need to carefully pick a word where:
- A is in positions 2-5
- O is in positions 1,2,4, or 5
- No R, S, or E

A good choice is ""COBRA"" but that has R. 

""CLOAK"" has A in position 4 (good), O in position 2 (good), and common letters C, L, K. But K is less common.

""FLOAT"" has A in 4 (good), O in 2 (good), but has T which wasn't ruled out but is new. However it has F and L which are less common.

Actually, ""COBIA"" might be the best available option that satisfies all constraints, even if slightly obscure.

But let me think simpler: since we know A and O must appear but not in their original positions, and we need new common consonants. The remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D. 

""ATOLL"" has A in position 1 (wrong). ""TALON"" has A in position 2 (good), O in position 4 (good), T N common consonants.

This seems optimal: TALON
- T (new)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- L (new)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- N (new)Based on the feedback:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- R, S, E are not in the word

I need a word that moves A and O to new positions while introducing new common consonants.
