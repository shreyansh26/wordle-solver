- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the feedback. 

Common starting words include those with letters like A, E, T, O, N, S, R, L, etc. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L)
- All letters are among the top 10 most common letters in English
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word AND in the correct (fifth) position (✓)

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, and we know the letters L, A, T must appear somewhere in the first four positions.

I should avoid S and any repeated letters. I'll look for a word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Contains L, A, T in different positions than in SLATE
3. Does not contain S

A possible arrangement: _ A _ _ E (moving A from position 3 to 2), L or T in position 1 or 3 or 4.

One such word is ""LATER"". Let's verify:
- L is now in position 1 (not position 2 as before)
- A is now in position 2 (not position 3 as before)
- T is now in position 3 (not position 4 as before)
- E is in position 5 (correct position as per feedback)
- R is a new letter

This satisfies all constraints.

Let's combine the information from both guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S not in word (x)
- L is in word but wrong spot (-)
- A is in word but wrong spot (-)
- T is in word but wrong spot (-)
- E is in word AND in the correct (5th) spot (✓)

- L is in word but wrong spot (-)  (we already knew this)
- A is in word AND in the correct (2nd) spot (✓)  (this updates its status)
- T is in word but wrong spot (-)  (we already knew this)
- E is in word but wrong spot (-)  — this is new and conflicts with Guess 1!

Wait, this is impossible: in Guess 1 E was marked ✓ (correct spot), but in Guess 2 it's marked - (wrong spot). Since E is in the same spot (5th) in both words, it should consistently be correct.

This appears to be an inconsistency in the provided feedback. Assuming the first feedback (E in correct spot) is accurate, let's proceed with:

- Pattern ??A?E (A confirmed in 2nd, E confirmed in 5th)
- L and T must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not their previous positions)
- S and R are not in word

Possible letters to include: L, T plus common remaining letters (I, O, N, etc.)
