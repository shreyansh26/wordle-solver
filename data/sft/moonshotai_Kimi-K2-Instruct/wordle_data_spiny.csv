This is the first guess, so we have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy for the first guess in Wordle is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information gained. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and two vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - covers common consonants and two vowels
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - covers three vowels and two common consonants

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes 3 vowels (A, I, E) which are very common in English words, plus two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and their positions.

- I (3rd position) is in the word and in the correct spot (✓)
- S (4th position) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, A, or E
4. The remaining letters must be from the 21 letters not yet eliminated.

- HOIST - same issue

- S P I N E – E is out
- S W I N G – tests W, N, G

Alternatively, ""SMITH"" – but T and H are not yet ruled out, and T is already out.

- E (5th position) is not in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The word has an I in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, A, or E
4. The remaining letters must be from the 21 letters not yet eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Contains none of R, A, E

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I (already placed), O, U

A good next guess would try to place S in a new position while testing other common letters. Let's consider words like:
- FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) - but S is in position 4 which we've ruled out
- HOIST - same issue
- MISTY - S is in position 4
- PISCO - S in position 4
- STICK - S in position 1, I in position 3, and tests new letters T, C, K

""STICK"" seems good:
- S in position 1 (valid since we only know S can't be in 4)
- T, C, K are new letters that might help narrow down the remaining positions
- Fits all constraints: _ _ I _ _ with S somewhere not in position 4

Other possibilities like ""WHISK"" would have S in position 4 which we know is wrong.

""STICK"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets all the current constraints.

- C (4th position) is NOT in the word (x)
- K (5th position) is NOT in the word (x)

Summary of what we now know:
1. Pattern: S _ I _ _  (S fixed at 1, I fixed at 3)
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, E, T, C, K
3. S is already in position 1, so it cannot appear elsewhere.

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible remaining vowels: O, U

We need a word that fits S _ I _ _ and uses only the allowed letters. We want a guess that tests common remaining letters to narrow down the 2nd and 5th positions.

Consider common 5-letter words fitting S _ I _ _:
- S I D E S – but E is out
- S I N G S – G, N, S are possible, but double S might be unlikely
- S P I N E – E is out
- S W I N G – tests W, N, G
- S L I D E – E is out
- S P I L L – tests P, L

""SWING"" (S W I N G) seems good: tests W, N, G while fitting the pattern. However, the 5th letter G hasn’t been ruled out (only C/K), but we want to test new letters.

Another candidate: ""SPILL"" (S P I L L). This tests P and L (twice), and L is common.

But ""SPILL"" has double L, which might be less likely.

Instead, ""SWING"" tests W, N, G – all new and common.

Alternatively, ""SMITH"" – but T and H are not yet ruled out, and T is already out.

""SLIMY"" (S L I M Y) – tests L, M, Y.

""SLIMY"" seems better as it tests three new letters (L, M, Y) and fits S _ I _ _.

Let me verify: S L I M Y – S ✓, L ?, I ✓, M ?, Y ?. None of these letters (L, M, Y) are in the banned list (R, A, E, T, C, K).

Thus, ""SLIMY"" is a valid next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

2. It contains an S somewhere, but not in the 4th position
3. It does NOT contain R, A, or E
4. The remaining letters must be from the 21 letters not yet eliminated.

- S P I N E – E is out
- S W I N G – tests W, N, G
- S L I D E – E is out
- S P I L L – tests P, L

""SWING"" (S W I N G) seems good: tests W, N, G while fitting the pattern. However, the 5th letter G hasn’t been ruled out (only C/K), but we want to test new letters.

Another candidate: ""SPILL"" (S P I L L). This tests P and L (twice), and L is common.

But ""SPILL"" has double L, which might be less likely.

Instead, ""SWING"" tests W, N, G – all new and common.

Alternatively, ""SMITH"" – but T and H are not yet ruled out, and T is already out.

""SLIMY"" (S L I M Y) – tests L, M, Y.

""SLIMY"" seems better as it tests three new letters (L, M, Y) and fits S _ I _ _.

Let me verify: S L I M Y – S ✓, L ?, I ✓, M ?, Y ?. None of these letters (L, M, Y) are in the banned list (R, A, E, T, C, K).

However, the 5th letter G hasn’t been ruled out (only C/K), but we want to test new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPILL"" (S P I L L). This tests P and L (twice), and L is common.\n\nBut ""SPILL"" has double L, which might be less likely.\n\nInstead, ""SWING"" tests W, N, G – all new and common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SMITH"" – but T and H are not yet ruled out, and T is already out.\n\n""SLIMY"" (S L I M Y) – tests L, M, Y.\n\n""SLIMY"" seems better as it tests three new letters (L, M, Y) and fits S _ I _ _.\n\nLet me verify: S L I M Y – S ✓, L ?, I ✓, M ?, Y ?.

Now we know:
- Pattern: S _ I N Y
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, E, T, C, K, L, M, H
- The only remaining position (2nd) must be filled by a single letter that is still allowed.

Allowed letters left (alphabet minus known absent letters):
B, D, F, G, J, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form S ? I N Y that is in the dictionary and uses one of those letters for the second slot.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, O, P, U (vowels)

Let’s list possibilities:
- S B I N Y → SBINY is not a valid word
- S D I N Y → SDINY is not a word
- S F I N Y → SFINY is not a word
- S G I N Y → SGINY is not a word
- S O I N Y → SOINY is not a word
- S P I N Y → SPINY is a valid English word
- S U I N Y → SUINY is not a word
- S V I N Y → SVINY is not a word
- S W I N Y → SWINY is not a word

Only “SPINY” is a valid word among those formed by the remaining letters.

Since N and Y are already confirmed in their positions, the second letter must be P.

Therefore, the word is “SPINY”.
