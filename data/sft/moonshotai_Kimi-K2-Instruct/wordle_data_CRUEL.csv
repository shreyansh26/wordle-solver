For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, T, N, L, S, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- ARISE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- STARE
- SLATE

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help identify or eliminate many possible letters early on.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- The word contains E, but E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and TREND feedback).
- Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, T, N, D.
- Letters already confirmed in the word: R (position 2), E (somewhere).
- We still need to test common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Best next move is to choose a word that:
1. Places R in position 2
2. Places E in position 1 or 4
3. Uses new untested consonants

Option 1: E in position 1 → E R _ _ _
Example: ERUPT (but P and U are ok, T is already excluded)

Option 2: E in position 4 → _ R _ E _
Example: B R E E D (but D is excluded), C R E E K (but K is ok), F R E E R (but R is already in position 2), etc.

A good choice would be ""CREEK"":
- C and K are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (correct)
- Pattern _ R _ E _ is allowed

But ""CREEP"" would have P which is ok, but has two E's which might not be optimal.

Even better: ""FRESH"" but S is excluded.

How about ""PREP""? P is new, but P is repeated.

Let's try ""CREEK"" as it tests C, K, and keeps E in position 4.

Wait, ""CREEK"" has E in position 3 which is invalid.

Let me re-examine:
E cannot be in position 3 or 5, so possible positions are 1 or 4.

Good options:
- E R _ _ _ → ERUPT (but T excluded), ERGOT (O excluded)
- _ R _ E _ → B R A V E (A excluded), F R I E D (D excluded), P R I Z E (Z uncommon), G R I P E (P ok), C R I M E (C,M ok)

""CRIME"" seems good:
- C, I, M are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)

No repeated letters to test more unique letters\n\nPopular and effective starting words include:\n- ARISE\n- RAISE\n- AROSE\n- STARE\n- SLATE\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the latest feedback (CRIME → C✓ R✓ Ix Mx E–):

1. Pattern so far: C R _ _ _
2. The word contains E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE and CRIME) and cannot be in positions 3 (TREND) or 4 (CRIME).  
   Therefore E **must** be in position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by C.  
   This is impossible, which means our previous assumption is wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- TREND: E is marked – (in word, wrong position).  
  T(x) R(✓) E(–) N(x) D(x) → E is not in position 3, but it could still be in 1, 4, or 5.
- CRIME: E is marked – again.  
  C(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) E(–) → E is not in position 5, but it could still be in 1 or 4.

So combining:
- E is in the word, but **not** in positions 3 or 5.
- Valid positions for E: 1 or 4.
- Current pattern: C R _ _ _ (from CRIME feedback).

Thus, E **must** be in position 4 because position 1 is already C.  
Pattern: C R _ E _

Letters already excluded (not in word): A, O, S, T, N, D, I, M  
Letters confirmed in word: C (1), R (2), E (4)  
Letters still to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- C R _ E _ with unused letters:
  - CRUEL (L, U new)
  - CREPE (P new, but double E allowed)
  - CRONE (O excluded)
  - CRUDE (U, D new, but D excluded)
  - CRAZE (A, Z excluded/uncommon)
  - CRIER (I excluded)
  - CRUET (U new, T excluded)

The best option is ""CRUEL"":
- Uses new letters L and U
- Pattern matches C R _ E _
- No excluded letters
