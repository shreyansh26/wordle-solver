Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words
- Covers multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- This combination has been statistically shown to be effective for Wordle-type games

From the feedback:
- C(x) → C is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 2).
- A(x), N(x), E(x) → A, N, E are not in the word.

So:
- Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E.
- Letter we know is somewhere in the word: R (but not in position 2).

A good next guess should:
1. Include R but not in position 2.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters C, A, N, E.
3. Use new letters to gain more information.

A common strategy is to use a word with R in a different position and introduce other frequent consonants and vowels. Good candidates include:
- TRIAL (but has A, which is eliminated) ❌
- BRIAR (has A twice) ❌
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — all new letters, R in position 2 is not allowed (but here R is in position 2, so no) ❌
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) — R is in position 2, which we know is wrong ❌
- GIRTH (G, I, R, T, H) — R is in position 3, which is allowed ✅

- HORSE (H, O, R, S, E) — E is eliminated ❌

1. R(✓) — R is now confirmed to be in position 3.

- Word must contain R in position 3.
- Word must contain O somewhere other than position 2.
- Eliminated letters so far: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 2).
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible structures: _ _ R _ _ with O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidate words:

- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N is eliminated ❌
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- PROXY (P, R, O, X, Y) — uses new letters, O is in position 3 (but R is already there) ❌
- GROUP (G, R, O, U, P) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y) — N is eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O appears twice, but we don’t know if there are multiple O’s yet. Also P is new. ✅
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) — no O ❌
- GROPE (G, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROOP — O in position 2 and 4, but position 2 is eliminated for O. ❌
- TROOP has O in position 2 and 4 — position 2 is invalid for O, so this is ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅

Actually, let me think differently. We know:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- MORPH (M, O, R, P, H) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- TORCH (T, O, R, C, H) — C is eliminated ❌
- BORON (B, O, R, O, N) — N eliminated ❌
- FORGE (F, O, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌
- GORGE (G, O, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌
- HORSE (H, O, R, S, E) — E eliminated ❌
- JORUM (J, O, R, U, M) — valid! J, O, R, U, M — all allowed letters, O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- PORCH (P, O, R, C, H) — C eliminated ❌
- SORRY (S, O, R, R, Y) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- TORUS (T, O, R, U, S) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- VOTER (V, O, T, E, R) — E eliminated ❌

Hmm, most common words with OR are placing O in position 2, which is invalid.

Let me try:
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R) — E eliminated ❌
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N eliminated ❌
- MURKY (M, U, R, K, Y) — no O ❌
- PURGE (P, U, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌

Let me think of words where O is in position 1:
- ORBIT (O, R, B, I, T) — R is in position 2, but we know R must be in position 3 ❌
- ORGAN (A, N eliminated) ❌
- ORIEL (E eliminated) ❌
- ORTOL (L eliminated) ❌

O in position 4:
- FORTH (F, O, R, T, H) — R in 3 is good, O in 2 is invalid ❌
- MORPH (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- SPORT (S, P, O, R, T) — R in 4, but must be in 3 ❌
- THORN (T, H, O, R, N) — N eliminated ❌
- SHORT (S, H, O, R, T) — R in 4 ❌
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) — N eliminated ❌

O in position 5:
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — R in 3 is good, O in 5 is allowed. But this has two R’s, which is possible.
- GURRO (not a valid word) ❌
- CARGO (C, A eliminated) ❌
- MORRO (M, O, R, R, O) — O in 2 is invalid ❌

Actually, let me try:
- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ✅
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D) — D eliminated ❌
- BROOM (B, R, O, O, M) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- BROOD (B, R, O, O, D) — D eliminated ❌

Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2, and 3 is R).
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ❌
- GROIN (N eliminated) ❌
- TROOP (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — O in 5 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This works! ✅
- BURRO is valid (though less common) and fits all constraints.

Another candidate:
- PORGY (P, O, R, G, Y) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- MURKY (no O) ❌
- SURLY (no O) ❌
- HURRY (no O) ❌

""BURRO"" seems the closest fit among valid words, though it's not super common. Let me check for others:

- FUROR (F, U, R, O, R) — O in 4 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This is a valid word! ✅
- FUROR: F, U, R, O, R — O in 4, R in 3, no eliminated letters.

""FUROR"" is better than ""BURRO"" because it introduces new letters (F, U) and has O in position 4.

So I'll go with FUROR.

</think>

From the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 3.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

We need a word with:
- R in position 3.
- O in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""FUROR"":

- TORUS (T, O, R, U, S) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- VOTER (V, O, T, E, R) — E eliminated ❌

Hmm, most common words with OR are placing O in position 2, which is invalid.

Let me try:
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R) — E eliminated ❌
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N eliminated ❌
- MURKY (M, U, R, K, Y) — no O ❌
- PURGE (P, U, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌

Let me think of words where O is in position 1:
- ORBIT (O, R, B, I, T) — R is in position 2, but we know R must be in position 3 ❌
- ORGAN (A, N eliminated) ❌
- ORIEL (E eliminated) ❌
- ORTOL (L eliminated) ❌

O in position 4:
- FORTH (F, O, R, T, H) — R in 3 is good, O in 2 is invalid ❌
- MORPH (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- SPORT (S, P, O, R, T) — R in 4, but must be in 3 ❌
- THORN (T, H, O, R, N) — N eliminated ❌
- SHORT (S, H, O, R, T) — R in 4 ❌
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) — N eliminated ❌

O in position 5:
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — R in 3 is good, O in 5 is allowed. But this has two R’s, which is possible.
- GURRO (not a valid word) ❌
- CARGO (C, A eliminated) ❌
- MORRO (M, O, R, R, O) — O in 2 is invalid ❌

Actually, let me try:
- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ✅
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D) — D eliminated ❌
- BROOM (B, R, O, O, M) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- BROOD (B, R, O, O, D) — D eliminated ❌

Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2, and 3 is R).
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ❌
- GROIN (N eliminated) ❌
- TROOP (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — O in 5 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This works! ✅
- BURRO is valid (though less common) and fits all constraints.

Another candidate:
- PORGY (P, O, R, G, Y) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- MURKY (no O) ❌
- SURLY (no O) ❌
- HURRY (no O) ❌

""BURRO"" seems the closest fit among valid words, though it's not super common. Let me check for others:

- FUROR (F, U, R, O, R) — O in 4 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This is a valid word! ✅
- FUROR: F, U, R, O, R — O in 4, R in 3, no eliminated letters.

""FUROR"" is better than ""BURRO"" because it introduces new letters (F, U) and has O in position 4.

So I'll go with FUROR.From the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 3.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

We need a word with:
- R in position 3.
- O in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""FUROR"":
- F, U, R, O, R — R is in position 3, O is in position 4 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.",Guess 3: FUROR -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(x) R(✓) O(✓) R(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,THROB,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words
- Covers multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- This combination has been statistically shown to be effective for Wordle-type games

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(x) → C is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 2).
- A(x), N(x), E(x) → A, N, E are not in the word.

So:
- Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E.
- Letter we know is somewhere in the word: R (but not in position 2).

A good next guess should:
1. Include R but not in position 2.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters C, A, N, E.
3. Use new letters to gain more information.

A common strategy is to use a word with R in a different position and introduce other frequent consonants and vowels. Good candidates include:
- TRIAL (but has A, which is eliminated) ❌
- BRIAR (has A twice) ❌
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — all new letters, R in position 2 is not allowed (but here R is in position 2, so no) ❌
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) — R is in position 2, which we know is wrong ❌
- GIRTH (G, I, R, T, H) — R is in position 3, which is allowed ✅
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N is eliminated ❌
- HORSE (H, O, R, S, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) — R is in position 3, and all new letters. ✅

""WORLD"" seems like a strong choice because:
- R is in position 3 (not position 2, which is allowed).
- Introduces W, O, L, D — all new letters.
- Uses common letters and has a good vowel/consonant mix.

<guess>WORLD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. R(✓) — R is now confirmed to be in position 3.
2. O(-) — O is in the word but is not in position 2.
3. W, L, D — all eliminated.

So we know:
- Word must contain R in position 3.
- Word must contain O somewhere other than position 2.
- Eliminated letters so far: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 2).
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible structures: _ _ R _ _ with O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidate words:
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) — N is eliminated ❌
- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N is eliminated ❌
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- PROXY (P, R, O, X, Y) — uses new letters, O is in position 3 (but R is already there) ❌
- GROUP (G, R, O, U, P) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y) — N is eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O appears twice, but we don’t know if there are multiple O’s yet. Also P is new. ✅
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) — no O ❌
- GROPE (G, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROOP — O in position 2 and 4, but position 2 is eliminated for O. ❌
- TROOP has O in position 2 and 4 — position 2 is invalid for O, so this is ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅

Actually, let me think differently. We know:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- MORPH (M, O, R, P, H) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌

Hmm, most common words with OR are placing O in position 2, which is invalid.

Let me try:
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R) — E eliminated ❌
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N eliminated ❌
- MURKY (M, U, R, K, Y) — no O ❌

- GURRO (not a valid word) ❌
- CARGO (C, A eliminated) ❌

- BROOM (B, R, O, O, M) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- BROOD (B, R, O, O, D) — D eliminated ❌

Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2, and 3 is R).
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Another candidate:
- PORGY (P, O, R, G, Y) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- MURKY (no O) ❌

""BURRO"" seems the closest fit among valid words, though it's not super common. Let me check for others:

- FUROR (F, U, R, O, R) — O in 4 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This is a valid word! ✅
- FUROR: F, U, R, O, R — O in 4, R in 3, no eliminated letters.

""FUROR"" is better than ""BURRO"" because it introduces new letters (F, U) and has O in position 4.

So I'll go with FUROR.From the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 3.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.

     Since R is already locked into position 3, this means the word must contain **exactly one R** (because the second R cannot appear anywhere else).

5. Word structure we need
   - Exactly 5 letters
   - 3rd letter = R
   - 4th letter = O
   - 1st, 2nd, 5th letters chosen only from the remaining letters
   - Only one R in the word

6. Candidate list (quick scan)

   - Y R O _ _  → impossible
   - Z R O _ _  → impossible

   None of the above work because they would repeat R. Therefore, the first two letters and the last letter must be chosen from the remaining set **and** must not create a second R. The only viable combinations are:

   - Choose any 3 distinct letters from {B, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, X, Y, Z} to fill positions 1, 2, 5 while keeping the word valid.

   - SHROD (invalid)
   - CHRON (invalid, C eliminated)
   - THROB (T, H, R, O, B)  → T, H, B not yet eliminated
   - THROG (not valid)
   - THROW (W eliminated)
   - TROOP (O already placed, would duplicate O; plus P allowed)
   - TROOP has two O’s: one at 4 is fixed, one at 2 would be extra; but we don’t yet know if O repeats.  The feedback for O in earlier guesses only confirmed one O exists, not that there aren’t two. So TROOP is a possibility.
   - STROP (S, T, R, O, P) — all letters allowed.  
   - STROP is a valid word meaning a strip of leather used for sharpening razors.

   Between THROB and STROP, STROP uses more new letters and is a valid word.

Therefore, the best next guess is STROP.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,THROB,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words
- Covers multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- This combination has been statistically shown to be effective for Wordle-type games

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(x) → C is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 2).
- A(x), N(x), E(x) → A, N, E are not in the word.

So:
- Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E.
- Letter we know is somewhere in the word: R (but not in position 2).

A good next guess should:
1. Include R but not in position 2.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters C, A, N, E.
3. Use new letters to gain more information.

A common strategy is to use a word with R in a different position and introduce other frequent consonants and vowels. Good candidates include:
- TRIAL (but has A, which is eliminated) ❌
- BRIAR (has A twice) ❌
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — all new letters, R in position 2 is not allowed (but here R is in position 2, so no) ❌
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T) — R is in position 2, which we know is wrong ❌
- GIRTH (G, I, R, T, H) — R is in position 3, which is allowed ✅
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N is eliminated ❌
- HORSE (H, O, R, S, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) — R is in position 3, and all new letters. ✅

""WORLD"" seems like a strong choice because:
- R is in position 3 (not position 2, which is allowed).
- Introduces W, O, L, D — all new letters.
- Uses common letters and has a good vowel/consonant mix.

<guess>WORLD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

WORLD → W(x) O(-) R(✓) L(x) D(x)

1. R(✓) — R is now confirmed to be in position 3.
2. O(-) — O is in the word but is not in position 2.
3. W, L, D — all eliminated.

So we know:
- Word must contain R in position 3.
- Word must contain O somewhere other than position 2.
- Eliminated letters so far: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 3.
- O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 2).
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible structures: _ _ R _ _ with O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidate words:
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) — N is eliminated ❌
- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N is eliminated ❌
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- PROXY (P, R, O, X, Y) — uses new letters, O is in position 3 (but R is already there) ❌
- GROUP (G, R, O, U, P) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y) — N is eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O appears twice, but we don’t know if there are multiple O’s yet. Also P is new. ✅
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K) — no O ❌
- GROPE (G, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) — E is eliminated ❌
- TROOP — O in position 2 and 4, but position 2 is eliminated for O. ❌
- TROOP has O in position 2 and 4 — position 2 is invalid for O, so this is ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in position 3 conflicts with R ✅

Actually, let me think differently. We know:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Eliminated: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- MORPH (M, O, R, P, H) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- TORCH (T, O, R, C, H) — C is eliminated ❌
- BORON (B, O, R, O, N) — N eliminated ❌
- FORGE (F, O, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌
- GORGE (G, O, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌
- HORSE (H, O, R, S, E) — E eliminated ❌
- JORUM (J, O, R, U, M) — valid! J, O, R, U, M — all allowed letters, O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- PORCH (P, O, R, C, H) — C eliminated ❌
- SORRY (S, O, R, R, Y) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- TORUS (T, O, R, U, S) — O in position 2 is invalid ❌
- VOTER (V, O, T, E, R) — E eliminated ❌

Hmm, most common words with OR are placing O in position 2, which is invalid.

Let me try:
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R) — E eliminated ❌
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) — N eliminated ❌
- MURKY (M, U, R, K, Y) — no O ❌
- PURGE (P, U, R, G, E) — E eliminated ❌

Let me think of words where O is in position 1:
- ORBIT (O, R, B, I, T) — R is in position 2, but we know R must be in position 3 ❌
- ORGAN (A, N eliminated) ❌
- ORIEL (E eliminated) ❌
- ORTOL (L eliminated) ❌

O in position 4:
- FORTH (F, O, R, T, H) — R in 3 is good, O in 2 is invalid ❌
- MORPH (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- SPORT (S, P, O, R, T) — R in 4, but must be in 3 ❌
- THORN (T, H, O, R, N) — N eliminated ❌
- SHORT (S, H, O, R, T) — R in 4 ❌
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) — N eliminated ❌

O in position 5:
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — R in 3 is good, O in 5 is allowed. But this has two R’s, which is possible.
- GURRO (not a valid word) ❌
- CARGO (C, A eliminated) ❌
- MORRO (M, O, R, R, O) — O in 2 is invalid ❌

Actually, let me try:
- GROIN (G, R, O, I, N) — N eliminated ❌
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ✅
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D) — D eliminated ❌
- BROOM (B, R, O, O, M) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- BROOD (B, R, O, O, D) — D eliminated ❌

Let me reconsider the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (not 2, and 3 is R).
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

Possible words:
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T) — O in 3 conflicts with R ❌
- GROIN (N eliminated) ❌
- TROOP (O in 2 invalid) ❌
- BURRO (B, U, R, R, O) — O in 5 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This works! ✅
- BURRO is valid (though less common) and fits all constraints.

Another candidate:
- PORGY (P, O, R, G, Y) — O in 2 invalid ❌
- MURKY (no O) ❌
- SURLY (no O) ❌
- HURRY (no O) ❌

""BURRO"" seems the closest fit among valid words, though it's not super common. Let me check for others:

- FUROR (F, U, R, O, R) — O in 4 is allowed, R in 3 is correct. This is a valid word! ✅
- FUROR: F, U, R, O, R — O in 4, R in 3, no eliminated letters.

""FUROR"" is better than ""BURRO"" because it introduces new letters (F, U) and has O in position 4.

So I'll go with FUROR.From the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 3.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

We need a word with:
- R in position 3.
- O in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No C, A, N, E, W, L, D.

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""FUROR"":
- F, U, R, O, R — R is in position 3, O is in position 4 (allowed), and no forbidden letters.

From the latest feedback:

STROP → S(x) T(-) R(✓) O(✓) P(x)

1. R is still fixed in position 3.
2. O is still fixed in position 4.
3. T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 2).
4. S and P are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ R O _  
And T must appear somewhere among positions 1 or 5 (it can’t be in 2, 3, 4).

Letters eliminated so far: C, A, N, E, W, L, D, F, U, S, P.

Remaining unused letters (excluding those already eliminated): B, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.  
We need to choose one of these two positions for T and one other letter:

Possible placements of T:
- Position 1: T _ R O _
- Position 5: _ _ R O T

We need to fill the remaining slot with one of the unused letters.

Valid English words that fit:
- T _ R O _   → T B R O _ (TBRO? invalid), T G R O _ (TGRO? invalid), etc. Most of these are not words.
- _ _ R O T   → _ _ R O T. We need two letters from the allowed set.

A quick check:
- B R O T (false)
- G R O T (false)
- H R O T (false)

- M R O T (false)
- Q R O T (false)
- V R O T (false)
- X R O T (false)
- Y R O T (false)
- Z R O T (false)

Only one that works is T R O T (but R is already in position 3). We need a valid 5-letter word.

The only remaining valid word I can see that fits is **TROOP**, but we have already considered that and the feedback from STROP did not eliminate O from repeating.

However, TROOP is invalid because P is eliminated. I need to reconsider.

Looking carefully: the pattern is _ _ R O T because T must be in position 5. The only remaining letters not eliminated are B, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid word of the form **X X R O T**.

- Z R O O T (invalid)

None of these are valid. I need to reconsider.

Let's try T in position 1 instead. Then the pattern is **T _ R O _**.

We need a valid word of the form **T X R O X**.

Looking at unused letters: B, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- T B R O B (invalid)
- T G R O B (invalid)
- T H R O B → THROB (valid word, T, H, R, O, B)

All letters are allowed. THROB fits all constraints:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- H in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (matches)
- O in position 4 (matches)
- B in position 5 (allowed)

This seems like the best choice.
