For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good starting word should have as many of these letters as possible, ideally without repeating any letters. 

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in different positions.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word and is in the correct (5th) position (✓)

So the secret word ends with N and does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

We need a five-letter word ending in N that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants still available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y
Common vowels still available: I, O, U

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a fresh set of common letters while keeping N fixed at the end.  
Two good choices:
1. “STOIN” – uses S, T, O, I, N (but O and I adjacent might be tricky)
2. “BLUNT” – uses B, L, U, N, T (but repeats N, which we already know at the end)

Better option: “STOIN” uses four fresh common letters plus the known N at position 5.

Let’s go with STONI to check S, T, O, I, N in positions 1-5 (N already locked in 5th).

Current known facts:
- Word length: 5
- Positions:
  1. S is correct (✓) → first letter must be S
  5. N is correct (✓) → last letter must be N
- Letters NOT present anywhere: C, R, A, E, T, O, I
- Letters still available (from alphabet minus the excluded ones):
  B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet used.

So the word is S _ _ _ N, and the middle three letters must come from {B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y}.

Goal: choose a word that fits S _ _ _ N and tests as many of the still-possible letters as possible.

Good candidates:
1. SOUND → S O U N D, but O and U are allowed (O wasn't excluded, but feedback for STONI had O(x) - so O is excluded. So SOUND is invalid.
2. SPAWN → S P A W N, but A is excluded (CRANE had A(x)).
3. SHOWN → S H O W N, O is excluded.
4. SWUNG → S W U N G, U not tested yet, W not tested, G not tested - this seems valid.
5. SLUNG → S L U N G - also valid, tests L, U, G.
6. STUNG → but T is excluded.

Between SWUNG and SLUNG, both are valid, but let’s pick SLUNG to test L, U, G.

But wait, let me double-check:
From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E:
- C, R, A, E excluded.
From STONI: S, T, O, N, I:
- S, N correct position (already used).
- T, O, I excluded.

So excluded letters: C, R, A, E, T, O, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, S, N.

Our pattern: S _ _ _ N.

Possible words:
- S + (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) for positions 2-4 + N.

Good options:
- SLUNG (S L U N G) - tests L, U, G
- SWUNG (S W U N G) - tests W, U, G
- SHOWN (but O is excluded, so no)
- SPUNK (but P, U, N, K - but N is already 5th, and word must be S _ _ _ N, so SPUNK is invalid)

SLUNG seems the most valid word here, testing L, U, G.

So next guess: SLUNG.
