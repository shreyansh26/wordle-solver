For the first guess in Wordle, the best approach is to use a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. Popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C, R (very common consonants)
- A (most common vowel)
- N, E (other frequent letters)

This gives a good distribution of letters and positions to work from.

Current information:

1. From CRANE: A is in position 3; C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. From BLOAT: L is in position 2; A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already know it is in position 3, so this tells us nothing new); B, O, T are not in the word.

So far:
- Word pattern: _ L A _ _
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

We need to look for five-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ _ and only use remaining letters. The remaining letters are: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – but N is already eliminated.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – N is already eliminated.
- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – N is already eliminated.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, which is allowed, but not ideal for info.
- FLASH (F, L, A, S, H) – same, S repeats.
- GLASS (G, L, A, S, S) – again S repeats.
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – but D is at position 5, which is fine, and all letters are new.
- CLAMP – but C is eliminated.
- SLAM – too short.

The best next guess seems to be PLAID, as it introduces new letters P, I, D and fits _ L A _ _. However, A cannot be in position 3, but we already know A is in position 3 from CRANE, so this is conflicting. Wait, let's re-examine:

From BLOAT feedback: A is in the word but in the wrong position. That means A is NOT in position 3, but CRANE told us it IS in position 3. This is a contradiction unless I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, no: CRANE said A(✓) meaning A is in position 3. BLOAT said A(-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position. This seems impossible because A cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also in the wrong position. This implies the feedback is being interpreted correctly.

This suggests an inconsistency, but more likely I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x) → A is in position 3 and correct.

BLOAT: B(x) L(✓) O(x) A(-) T(x) → L is in position 2 (correct spot), A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (since position 3 was tried and is wrong), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But CRANE said A is in position 3, which is a contradiction.

This means the feedback from BLOAT overrides the position of A from CRANE. The A(✓) from CRANE must be interpreted that A is in position 3, but the A(-) from BLOAT says A is in the word but not in position 3. This is only possible if the feedback from CRANE was that A is in position 3 (✓), but BLOAT shows A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 4 (since in BLOAT, A is in position 4). 

Wait, positions: CRANE is 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E. So A is in position 3. BLOAT is 1-B, 2-L, 3-O, 4-A, 5-T. So the A in BLOAT is in position 4, and feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not conflict with A being in position 3 from CRANE. So the correct interpretation is:

- A is in the word and is in position 3 (from CRANE).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT).
- B, O, T are not in the word (from BLOAT).
- So the pattern is _ L A _ _

Now, possible letters: must avoid C, R, N, E, B, O, T. The word is _ L A _ _. 

Looking for common words fitting this:
- PLAIN (but N is eliminated)
- GLAZE (Z and E – E is eliminated)
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – all letters allowed.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, not ideal.
- FLASK (F, L, A, S, K) – but K is allowed.

PLAID seems good: P, L, A, I, D – all new letters except L and A which we know positions of.

Now we know:
- A is in position 3 (from CRANE ✓).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT ✓).
- Letters eliminated: B, C, E, N, O, R, T.
- Pattern: _ L A _ _

Next guess should test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5. ""PLAID"" fits _ L A _ _ and uses new letters P, I, D.

- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

We need to look for five-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ _ and only use remaining letters. The remaining letters are: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – but N is already eliminated.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – N is already eliminated.
- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – N is already eliminated.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, which is allowed, but not ideal for info.
- FLASH (F, L, A, S, H) – same, S repeats.
- GLASS (G, L, A, S, S) – again S repeats.
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – but D is at position 5, which is fine, and all letters are new.
- CLAMP – but C is eliminated.
- SLAM – too short.

The best next guess seems to be PLAID, as it introduces new letters P, I, D and fits _ L A _ _. However, A cannot be in position 3, but we already know A is in position 3 from CRANE, so this is conflicting. Wait, let's re-examine:

From BLOAT feedback: A is in the word but in the wrong position. That means A is NOT in position 3, but CRANE told us it IS in position 3. This is a contradiction unless I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, no: CRANE said A(✓) meaning A is in position 3. BLOAT said A(-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position. This seems impossible because A cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also in the wrong position. This implies the feedback is being interpreted correctly.

This suggests an inconsistency, but more likely I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x) → A is in position 3 and correct.

BLOAT: B(x) L(✓) O(x) A(-) T(x) → L is in position 2 (correct spot), A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (since position 3 was tried and is wrong), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But CRANE said A is in position 3, which is a contradiction.

This means the feedback from BLOAT overrides the position of A from CRANE. The A(✓) from CRANE must be interpreted that A is in position 3, but the A(-) from BLOAT says A is in the word but not in position 3. This is only possible if the feedback from CRANE was that A is in position 3 (✓), but BLOAT shows A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 4 (since in BLOAT, A is in position 4). 

Wait, positions: CRANE is 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E. So A is in position 3. BLOAT is 1-B, 2-L, 3-O, 4-A, 5-T. So the A in BLOAT is in position 4, and feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not conflict with A being in position 3 from CRANE. So the correct interpretation is:

- A is in the word and is in position 3 (from CRANE).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT).
- B, O, T are not in the word (from BLOAT).
- So the pattern is _ L A _ _

Now, possible letters: must avoid C, R, N, E, B, O, T. The word is _ L A _ _. 

Looking for common words fitting this:
- PLAIN (but N is eliminated)
- GLAZE (Z and E – E is eliminated)
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – all letters allowed.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, not ideal.
- FLASK (F, L, A, S, K) – but K is allowed.

PLAID seems good: P, L, A, I, D – all new letters except L and A which we know positions of.Now we know:
- A is in position 3 (from CRANE ✓).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT ✓).
- Letters eliminated: B, C, E, N, O, R, T.
- Pattern: _ L A _ _

Next guess should test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5. ""PLAID"" fits _ L A _ _ and uses new letters P, I, D.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. From CRANE:  
   - A is in position 3.  
   - C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.

2. From BLOAT:  
   - L is in position 2.  
   - B, O, T are NOT in the word.

3. From PLAID:  
   - L is still in position 2 (✓).  
   - A is still in position 3 (✓).  
   - P, I, D are NOT in the word.

Current pattern and eliminations  
- Pattern: _ L A _ _  
- Eliminated letters: B, C, D, E, I, N, O, P, R, T  

Remaining candidate letters: A, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus the known A and L already placed).

We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Common valid 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ _ with the remaining letters:

- GLASS – G, S, S (S repeats, but allowed)  
- FLASK – F, S, K (F is fine, K allowed)  
- SLACK – S, K (but C eliminated)  
- FLAMS – F, M, S (slang/uncommon)  
- GLAMS – G, M, S (slang)  
- SLAMS – S, M, S (S repeats)  
- GLANS – N eliminated  
- ULAMA – U, M (valid word, but rare)  

The two strongest candidates with non-repeating letters and high-frequency letters are:

- FLASK – F, S, K  
- SLAMS – S, L, A, M, S (S repeats)

FLASK uses three completely new letters F, S, K and has no repeats.  
SLAMS has an S repeat, giving less info.

So choose FLASK.

Check that F, S, K are all still allowed.  
Yes: not in any eliminated list.

The goal is to maximize information gain. Popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C, R (very common consonants)
- A (most common vowel)
- N, E (other frequent letters)

This gives a good distribution of letters and positions to work from.

- Remaining letters (B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z) are still possible.
- We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3 and none of C, R, N, E.

Next word should introduce several new common consonants/vowels while respecting the constraints. Good candidates:
- BLOAT (B, L, O, T all new and common)
- FLASK (but S and K are less common first-guess letters)
- PLAID (P, L, I, D)

2. From BLOAT: L is in position 2; A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already know it is in position 3, so this tells us nothing new); B, O, T are not in the word.

So far:
- Word pattern: _ L A _ _
- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, B, O, T

We need to look for five-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ _ and only use remaining letters. The remaining letters are: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – but N is already eliminated.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – N is already eliminated.
- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – N is already eliminated.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, which is allowed, but not ideal for info.
- FLASH (F, L, A, S, H) – same, S repeats.
- GLASS (G, L, A, S, S) – again S repeats.
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – but D is at position 5, which is fine, and all letters are new.
- CLAMP – but C is eliminated.
- SLAM – too short.

The best next guess seems to be PLAID, as it introduces new letters P, I, D and fits _ L A _ _. However, A cannot be in position 3, but we already know A is in position 3 from CRANE, so this is conflicting. Wait, let's re-examine:

From BLOAT feedback: A is in the word but in the wrong position. That means A is NOT in position 3, but CRANE told us it IS in position 3. This is a contradiction unless I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, no: CRANE said A(✓) meaning A is in position 3. BLOAT said A(-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position. This seems impossible because A cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also in the wrong position. This implies the feedback is being interpreted correctly.

This suggests an inconsistency, but more likely I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x) → A is in position 3 and correct.

BLOAT: B(x) L(✓) O(x) A(-) T(x) → L is in position 2 (correct spot), A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (since position 3 was tried and is wrong), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But CRANE said A is in position 3, which is a contradiction.

This means the feedback from BLOAT overrides the position of A from CRANE. The A(✓) from CRANE must be interpreted that A is in position 3, but the A(-) from BLOAT says A is in the word but not in position 3. This is only possible if the feedback from CRANE was that A is in position 3 (✓), but BLOAT shows A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 4 (since in BLOAT, A is in position 4). 

Wait, positions: CRANE is 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E. So A is in position 3. BLOAT is 1-B, 2-L, 3-O, 4-A, 5-T. So the A in BLOAT is in position 4, and feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not conflict with A being in position 3 from CRANE. So the correct interpretation is:

- A is in the word and is in position 3 (from CRANE).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT).
- B, O, T are not in the word (from BLOAT).
- So the pattern is _ L A _ _

Now, possible letters: must avoid C, R, N, E, B, O, T. The word is _ L A _ _. 

Looking for common words fitting this:
- PLAIN (but N is eliminated)
- GLAZE (Z and E – E is eliminated)
- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – all letters allowed.
- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, not ideal.
- FLASK (F, L, A, S, K) – but K is allowed.

PLAID seems good: P, L, A, I, D – all new letters except L and A which we know positions of.Now we know:
- A is in position 3 (from CRANE ✓).
- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT ✓).
- Letters eliminated: B, C, E, N, O, R, T.
- Pattern: _ L A _ _

Next guess should test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5. ""PLAID"" fits _ L A _ _ and uses new letters P, I, D.

Remaining candidate letters: A, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus the known A and L already placed).

We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Common valid 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ _ with the remaining letters:

- GLASS – G, S, S (S repeats, but allowed)  
- FLASK – F, S, K (F is fine, K allowed)  
- SLACK – S, K (but C eliminated)

- GLAMS – G, M, S (slang)  
- SLAMS – S, M, S (S repeats)  
- GLANS – N eliminated  
- ULAMA – U, M (valid word, but rare)  

The two strongest candidates with non-repeating letters and high-frequency letters are:

- FLASK – F, S, K  
- SLAMS – S, L, A, M, S (S repeats)

FLASK uses three completely new letters F, S, K and has no repeats.  
SLAMS has an S repeat, giving less info.

The goal is to maximize information gain. Popular starting words include:\n- CRANE\n- SLATE\n- CRISP\n- ADIEU\n- AUDIO\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:\n- C, R (very common consonants)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- N, E (other frequent letters)\n\nThis gives a good distribution of letters and positions to work from.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Feedback recap:  \nC(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n- A is confirmed in position 3.\n- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word at all.\n- Remaining letters (B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z) are still possible.\n- We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3 and none of C, R, N, E.\n\nNext word should introduce several new common consonants/vowels while respecting the constraints. Good candidates:\n- BLOAT (B, L, O, T all new and common)\n- FLASK (but S and K are less common first-guess letters)\n- PLAID (P, L, I, D)\n\nAmong them, ""BLOAT"" is strong because it uses very common letters B, L, O, T and keeps A in position 3.\n\n<guess>BLOAT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BLOAT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) O(x) A(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current information:\n\n1.

From BLOAT: L is in position 2; A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already know it is in position 3, so this tells us nothing new); B, O, T are not in the word.\n\nSo far:\n- Word pattern: _ L A _ _\n- Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, B, O, T\n\nWe need to look for five-letter words that fit the pattern _ L A _ _ and only use remaining letters. The remaining letters are: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – but N is already eliminated.\n- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – N is already eliminated.\n- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – N is already eliminated.\n- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, which is allowed, but not ideal for info.\n- FLASH (F, L, A, S, H) – same, S repeats.\n- GLASS (G, L, A, S, S) – again S repeats.\n- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – but D is at position 5, which is fine, and all letters are new.\n- CLAMP – but C is eliminated.\n- SLAM – too short.\n\nThe best next guess seems to be PLAID, as it introduces new letters P, I, D and fits _ L A _ _. However, A cannot be in position 3, but we already know A is in position 3 from CRANE, so this is conflicting. Wait, let\'s re-examine:\n\nFrom BLOAT feedback: A is in the word but in the wrong position. That means A is NOT in position 3, but CRANE told us it IS in position 3. This is a contradiction unless I\'m misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no: CRANE said A(✓) meaning A is in position 3. BLOAT said A(-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position. This seems impossible because A cannot simultaneously be in position 3 and also in the wrong position. This implies the feedback is being interpreted correctly.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency, but more likely I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:\n\nCRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x) → A is in position 3 and correct.\n\nBLOAT: B(x) L(✓) O(x) A(-) T(x) → L is in position 2 (correct spot), A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (since position 3 was tried and is wrong), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But CRANE said A is in position 3, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis means the feedback from BLOAT overrides the position of A from CRANE. The A(✓) from CRANE must be interpreted that A is in position 3, but the A(-) from BLOAT says A is in the word but not in position 3. This is only possible if the feedback from CRANE was that A is in position 3 (✓), but BLOAT shows A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 4 (since in BLOAT, A is in position 4). \n\nWait, positions: CRANE is 1-C, 2-R, 3-A, 4-N, 5-E. So A is in position 3. BLOAT is 1-B, 2-L, 3-O, 4-A, 5-T. So the A in BLOAT is in position 4, and feedback says A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. This does not conflict with A being in position 3 from CRANE. So the correct interpretation is:\n\n- A is in the word and is in position 3 (from CRANE).\n- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT).\n- B, O, T are not in the word (from BLOAT).\n- So the pattern is _ L A _ _\n\nNow, possible letters: must avoid C, R, N, E, B, O, T. The word is _ L A _ _. \n\nLooking for common words fitting this:\n- PLAIN (but N is eliminated)\n- GLAZE (Z and E – E is eliminated)\n- PLAID (P, L, A, I, D) – all letters allowed.\n- SLASH (S, L, A, S, H) – S repeats, not ideal.\n- FLASK (F, L, A, S, K) – but K is allowed.\n\nPLAID seems good: P, L, A, I, D – all new letters except L and A which we know positions of.Now we know:\n- A is in position 3 (from CRANE ✓).\n- L is in position 2 (from BLOAT ✓).\n- Letters eliminated: B, C, E, N, O, R, T.\n- Pattern: _ L A _ _\n\nNext guess should test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

From all feedback so far we know:

1. Fixed letters: L (pos 2), A (pos 3), S (pos 4).  
   Pattern: _  L  A  S  _

2. Eliminated letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, I, K, N, O, P, R, T (plus the earlier C, R, N, E).

3. Remaining candidate letters: H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. GLASS feedback: last S is in the word but in the wrong position 5 → the final letter must be S but NOT at position 5. However, position 4 is already S, so the word must contain two S’s and the last S is at position 5, which is impossible. This contradiction means the last letter CANNOT be S again. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the secret word has the single S in position 4, and the last letter is one of the remaining unused letters.

5. Recalculating: the word is _ L A S _ with the final letter chosen from the unused set {H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}. Common English 5-letter words that fit _ L A S _:

   - ULAS? – invalid  
   - HLAS? – invalid  
   - MLAS? – invalid  
   - V L A S ? – VLAS? – invalid  
   - W L A S ? – WLAS? – invalid  
   - J L A S ? – JLAS? – invalid  
   - Q L A S ? – QLAS? – invalid  
   - X, Y, Z give nothing.

But there is one real word: CLASH – but C is out.  
FLASK – F out.  
PLASH – P out.  
SLASH – S repeats but S is already at 4, so pattern would need S L A S H.  
That pattern would be S L A S H. Let’s check letters: S is allowed, L allowed, A allowed, S allowed (only one S in positions 4 and 1), H allowed. All other letters used so far are avoided.

Therefore the only remaining valid English word is SLASH.
