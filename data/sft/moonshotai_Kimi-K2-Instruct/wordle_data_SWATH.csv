Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters. This gives us good coverage to start eliminating possibilities and finding correct letters.

Current confirmed information:

1. Letters in the word and their positions:
   - S is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in position 3 (✓)

2. Letters in the word but in wrong positions:
   - None additional (T is marked (-) but that only means it's in the word, wrong spot; however, we already know A and S are in correct spots, so T must be somewhere else)

3. Letters NOT in the word:
   - R, O, E (from arose)

4. Letters still possible (not yet ruled out):
   - B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - T (from stand, now known to be in word but not in position 2)

So the word structure is: S _ A _ _
And T must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 2: S T A _ _
- Position 4: S _ A T _
- Position 5: S _ A _ T

We need to test a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1 and A in position 3
- Places T in one of the remaining positions (2, 4, or 5)
- Uses new letters not yet tested (avoiding R,O,E,N,D)

Let's try placing T in position 2: S T A _ _
We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5. Common remaining letters: L, I, M, P, etc.

A word like ""STAMP"" would fit:
- S T A M P
- Uses new letters M and P
- Tests T in position 2

But if T isn't in position 2, we'll get feedback telling us where it should be instead.

Alternative: ""STALE"" - but E is already ruled out.
""STALK"" - K is new
""STAIN"" - N is ruled out
""STAFF"" - F is new
""STAMP"" seems good.

Actually, let's think differently - since we know T is in the word but not in position 2, let's try placing it in position 4 or 5. Position 4 might be better to test.

We need to test a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1 and A in position 3
- Places T in one of the remaining positions (2, 4, or 5)
- Uses new letters not yet tested (avoiding R,O,E,N,D)

Let's try placing T in position 2: S T A _ _
We need two new letters for positions 4 and 5. Common remaining letters: L, I, M, P, etc.

A word like ""STAMP"" would fit:
- S T A M P
- Uses new letters M and P
- Tests T in position 2

But if T isn't in position 2, we'll get feedback telling us where it should be instead.

Alternative: ""STALE"" - but E is already ruled out.
""STALK"" - K is new
""STAIN"" - N is ruled out
""STAFF"" - F is new
""STAMP"" seems good.

Actually, let's think differently - since we know T is in the word but not in position 2, let's try placing it in position 4 or 5. Position 4 might be better to test.

So structure: S _ A T _
We need letters for positions 2 and 5. Good candidates: L, I, M, P, etc.

""SLATE"" - E ruled out
""SMART"" - R ruled out
""SPATE"" - E ruled out
""SHAFT"" - H, F new
""SWATH"" - W, H new

Let's pick ""SWATH"":
- S W A T H
- Tests T in position 4
- Uses W and H which are new
- Fits all constraints

But is SWATH a common word? Maybe better to pick something more common.

Alternative: ""SHALT"" - but T would be in position 5 here.
""SHALT"" - S H A L T
- Tests T in position 5
- Uses H and L
- Common word

Between SWATH and SHALT, SHALT seems more common.

Let me verify:
Word: S _ A _ _
Known: T must appear somewhere
SHALT: S H A L T
- T in position 5 (new test)
- H and L are new letters

This seems optimal.Based on the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- N and D are not in the word (x)
- R, O, E from first guess are also not in the word

The word structure is S _ A _ _, with T appearing somewhere. Since T isn't in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5. Let's test T in position 5 to narrow this down.

Letters already ruled out (from all guesses)

Remaining open position is 2.

- S C A T H (again H fails)  
- S B A T H (H fails)  
- S F A T H (H fails)  
- S G A T H (H fails)  

The only standard-looking form left is “SCATT” (but double T is unlikely), or “SCATY” (not a common word).  
More likely is “SCATH” which is archaic but appears in dictionaries, yet H was already tried.  
Another option: “SCANT” … but N is out.  
“SCARF” … but F hasn’t been tried and word ends with F instead of T.

Wait: we know T is in position 4, so the word must be S _ A T _.

- S C A T S   – duplicate S at end (invalid)
- S C A T H   – H was tried and marked (-), so H is in word but wrong position?  
  But in “shalt” the H was marked (-) which means “H is somewhere in the word, just not in position 2”.  
  Therefore H is still possible in position 5.

From the latest feedback:

- S(✓) C(x) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓)

This means:
- S in position 1 ✓
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- A in position 3 ✓
- T in position 4 ✓
- H in position 5 ✓

So the word is now fully determined: S _ A T H with position 2 still open.

But C was just ruled out for position 2, and we already have ruled out:
- R, O, E (from arose)
- N, D (from stand)
- L (from shalt)

So possible letters for position 2 from remaining common letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for standard English 5-letter words of form S ? A T H where ? is not yet ruled out.

Common candidates:
- S B A T H → ""sbath"" (not standard)
- S F A T H → ""sfath"" (not standard)
- S G A T H → ""sgath"" (not standard)
- S M A T H → ""smath"" (not standard)
- S P A T H → ""spath"" (valid word, meaning a broad blade or the plant spathiphyllum)
- S W A T H → ""swath"" (valid word, meaning a strip or path)

""SPATH"" and ""SWATH"" are both valid. Between these, ""SWATH"" is more common, and W has not been tried yet (whereas P has been implicitly tested via C in scath, but P not ruled out). Let's check W hasn't been used - looking back, none of the guesses used W, so it's valid.

Therefore, the only remaining logical word is ""SWATH"".
