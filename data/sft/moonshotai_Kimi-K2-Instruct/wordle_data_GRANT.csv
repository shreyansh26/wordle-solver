For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all common letters that appear in many words.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ _ A _ _ (A locked in position 3)
2. Letters that are definitely in the word:
   - A (position 3)
   - T (somewhere, but NOT position 1 or 4)
   - R (somewhere, but NOT position 2)

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
   S, L, E, I, D

4. Remaining positions needing consonants/vowels: 1, 2, 4, 5

   - T cannot be in 1 or 4, so T must be in 2 or 5.
   - R cannot be in 2, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

5. Useful remaining common letters not yet tested: C, H, N, M, P, O, U, B, G, etc.

Because T is still floating (position 2 or 5), I’ll try placing T in position 5 and R in position 1, then fill with common consonants/vowels that haven’t appeared yet. A good candidate is:
C R A N T (but this would place R in 2, which we know is wrong) – so skip that.

How about:
M A R T _ – but we need five letters with A in the middle.

A plausible word satisfying all constraints:
C R A T _ – no, that’s only 4 letters.

Let’s construct:
- Position 1: R (allowed, not tested)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: T (allowed)
- Positions 2 & 4: need new letters not in {S, L, E, I, D}

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ A _ T  (A locked in position 3, T locked in position 5)
2. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, T
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, E, I, D, C, H

Available letters (not yet ruled out) for positions 1, 2, and 4:
Vowels: O, U
Consonants: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

R must appear in the word somewhere (it can’t be in positions 2 or 4 because in CHART it was position 4 and was marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not there).  
Therefore R must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try R in position 1, then:

R _ A _ T

We need two more distinct letters (positions 2 and 4) from the remaining allowed set.

To maximize coverage, pick common consonants that haven’t been used.

“M” and “N” are common and still allowed.

A valid word satisfying all constraints: RAMNT – invalid, not a word.

Try: R A M N T – but that’s not valid either (A already fixed in position 3).

Correct pattern: R _ A _ T

A real word fitting this: R A N C T – nope.

Real word: R O A N T – not valid.

Real word: R O A M T – not valid.

Real word: R A M P T – not valid.

Real word: R A M E T – E is excluded.

Real word: R A M U T – not valid.

Real word: R A M O T – not valid.

Real word: R A M B T – not valid.

Real word: R A M S T – S is excluded.

Real word: R A M N T – not valid.

Let’s try R in position 2 instead:

_ R A _ T

Now positions 1 and 4 need letters.

Common letters: M, N, O, P, U, etc.

Real word: M R A N T – invalid.

Real word: B R A N T – invalid.

Real word: G R A N T – valid!

Check constraints:
- G: not yet used
- R: position 2 (allowed, since R was “-” in CHART meaning it’s not in position 4)
- A: position 3 (correct)
- N: new letter
- T: position 5 (correct)

GRANT fits all constraints.
