For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possible vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - many common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - similar idea)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage)
- ADIEU (many vowels, but less consonant coverage)

Among these, AROSE is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for the first guess to see which letters might be present in the secret word.

Another solid option is SLATE, which has S, L, A, T, E. Between these, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage and R/S are very common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
2. Contains O and E somewhere, but:
   - O is not in the 3rd position.
   - E is not in the 5th position.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters we know ARE in the word: O, E (but at unknown positions)

Now for the next guess, we want to:
- Include O and E in different positions than before
- Avoid A, R, S
- Try to introduce new common consonants to test for presence

Good letters to test next: common consonants like L, N, T, D, C, etc., and maybe another vowel like I or U.

A good candidate word would use O and E in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try ""OCEAN"" but that has C and N (good) but also A which we know is not in the word. So that's bad.

Next idea: ""OFTEN"" - but it has F and T and N, but E is in 5th position which we know is wrong. So E needs to move.

""DOING"" - has D, I, N, G, but missing E.

""ELBOW"" - has E in 1st, L, B, O, W - E in 1st is new, O in 4th is new, introduces L, B, W.

""BLOKE"" - B, L, O, K, E - O in 3rd is same as before which is wrong, so no.

""POKED"" - P, O, K, E, D - O in 2nd is new, E in 4th is new, introduces P, K, D.

This seems good - positions O(2) and E(4) are new, and introduces P, K, D which are new letters not tested yet.

Alternatively ""TOWER"" - but has R which we know is out.

""CLOVE"" - has C, L, O, V, E - O in 3rd is same as before (invalid), so no.

""VOICE"" - V, O, I, C, E - O in 2nd, E in 5th is invalid (E can't be 5th).

""DOPEY"" - D, O, P, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th - both new positions, introduces D, P, Y.

""LOWED"" - L, O, W, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces L, W, D.

Between POKED and LOWED, POKED introduces P and K which are slightly less common, while LOWED introduces L and W. Both are good, but let's go with LOWED as L is very common.

Wait - LOWED has E in 5th which we know is invalid. So E is in 4th here which is OK (feedback said E is not in 5th, so 4th is fine).

But LOWED is actually E in 4th, so that's OK. But looking back POKED has E in 4th too.

Another option: ""MONEY"" - M, O, N, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces M, N, Y.

But MONEY has E in 5th which is invalid. So no.

""CONED"" - C, O, N, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces C, N, D.

BONGE – invalid.  

Try shifting N later:  
BOGNE – invalid.  
BOGEN – invalid.  
BOVNE – invalid.  

Re-evaluate: maybe N does not appear at all? But feedback says N is in the word (but wrong position). So N must be present but not in 3rd.  

Word must have N in 1st, 4th or 5th.  

Examples:  
N O _ _ E – impossible, O already in 2nd.  
_ O N _ E – but N would be 3rd again.  
_ O _ N E – N 4th, E 5th: that satisfies N not in 3rd and E not in 4th.  
_ O _ _ N – E must fit somewhere.  

So structure: O in 2, N in 4 or 5, E in 1,3 or 5.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,woken,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possible vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - many common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - similar idea)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage)
- ADIEU (many vowels, but less consonant coverage)

Among these, AROSE is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for the first guess to see which letters might be present in the secret word.

Another solid option is SLATE, which has S, L, A, T, E. Between these, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage and R/S are very common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
2. Contains O and E somewhere, but:
   - O is not in the 3rd position.
   - E is not in the 5th position.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters we know ARE in the word: O, E (but at unknown positions)

Now for the next guess, we want to:
- Include O and E in different positions than before
- Avoid A, R, S
- Try to introduce new common consonants to test for presence

Good letters to test next: common consonants like L, N, T, D, C, etc., and maybe another vowel like I or U.

A good candidate word would use O and E in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try ""OCEAN"" but that has C and N (good) but also A which we know is not in the word. So that's bad.

Next idea: ""OFTEN"" - but it has F and T and N, but E is in 5th position which we know is wrong. So E needs to move.

""DOING"" - has D, I, N, G, but missing E.

""ELBOW"" - has E in 1st, L, B, O, W - E in 1st is new, O in 4th is new, introduces L, B, W.

""BLOKE"" - B, L, O, K, E - O in 3rd is same as before which is wrong, so no.

""POKED"" - P, O, K, E, D - O in 2nd is new, E in 4th is new, introduces P, K, D.

This seems good - positions O(2) and E(4) are new, and introduces P, K, D which are new letters not tested yet.

Alternatively ""TOWER"" - but has R which we know is out.

""CLOVE"" - has C, L, O, V, E - O in 3rd is same as before (invalid), so no.

""VOICE"" - V, O, I, C, E - O in 2nd, E in 5th is invalid (E can't be 5th).

""DOPEY"" - D, O, P, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th - both new positions, introduces D, P, Y.

""LOWED"" - L, O, W, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces L, W, D.

Between POKED and LOWED, POKED introduces P and K which are slightly less common, while LOWED introduces L and W. Both are good, but let's go with LOWED as L is very common.

Wait - LOWED has E in 5th which we know is invalid. So E is in 4th here which is OK (feedback said E is not in 5th, so 4th is fine).

But LOWED is actually E in 4th, so that's OK. But looking back POKED has E in 4th too.

Another option: ""MONEY"" - M, O, N, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces M, N, Y.

But MONEY has E in 5th which is invalid. So no.

""CONED"" - C, O, N, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces C, N, D.

This seems good - all letters new, O and E in new positions.

I think CONED is a strong next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, S are not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CONED):
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, D are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 3 (NOBLE):
- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (re-confirmed).
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.
- B, L are not in the word.

Key facts:
1. Positional constraints:
   - Position 2 is O.
   - E must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it can't be 4 or 5 from earlier, but wait: from CONED E can't be 4, from AROSE E can't be 5, so E must be 1 or 3).
   - N must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is O), so N is in 4 or 5.

2. Eliminated letters: A, B, C, D, L, R, S.

3. Possible remaining letters: E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints:
- The word format is _ O _ _ _ with O fixed in position 2.
- E must be in position 1 or 3.
- N must be in position 4 or 5.
- No eliminated letters.

Let's explore possible combinations:

Case 1: E in position 1
Word format: E O _ _ _
N must be in position 4 or 5.

Subcase 1a: N in 4
E O _ N _
Possible letters for 3 and 5: must be from remaining possible letters and form a valid word.
Possible candidates: E O M N E, E O M N Y, etc. - but we need valid words.

Subcase 1b: N in 5
E O _ _ N
Possible candidates: E O M A N - but A is eliminated. E O M I N - valid word? EMON is not a word. E O M I N - ""EMOIN"" not valid.

Case 2: E in position 3
Word format: _ O E _ _
N must be in position 4 or 5.

Subcase 2a: N in 4
_ O E N _
Possible candidates: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z for position 1.
Check F: F O E N _
""FOEN"" - not valid.
H: H O E N - not valid.
M: M O E N - ""MOEN"" - valid word (as in Moen faucets).
Check constraints: M, O, E, N - all allowed, positions:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 3 (valid, since it can't be 4 or 5)
N in 4 (valid, since it can't be 3)
No eliminated letters used.

Subcase 2b: N in 5
_ O E _ N
Possible candidates: F O E T N - not valid. M O E T N - not valid. P O E T N - not valid.

Thus, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is MOENX - but that's not a word. Wait, MOEN is 4 letters. Actually, ""MOEN"" is a proper noun. Let me check standard dictionary words.

Looking at standard 5-letter words with O in 2, E in 3, N in 4:
The word is _ O E N _ - but we need 5 letters. So the last letter must be a valid fifth letter.

Actually, looking at the format _ O _ _ N with E in 3:
_ O E _ N
Possible letters for 1 and 4: must form a word.
F O E T N - invalid.
G O E T N - invalid.
M O E T N - invalid.
P O E T N - invalid.

Going back to _ O _ N _ with E in 1:
E O M N _ - need a fifth letter. E O M N E - ""EOMNE"" - invalid.
E O M N Y - invalid.

Re-examining, the correct approach is to list all valid 5-letter words with O in 2, N in 4 or 5, E in 1 or 3, no eliminated letters.

Possible valid words:
- MONEY: M, O, N, E, Y
Check positions and letters:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 4 - but from CONED, E can't be 4. So MONEY is invalid.
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N
Check positions:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 4 - invalid.
- VENOM: V, E, N, O, M - but O is not in 2. Invalid.
- GONER: G, O, N, E, R - R is eliminated. Invalid.
- JONES: J, O, N, E, S - S is eliminated. Invalid.

Wait, our constraints:
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- E is in 1 or 3
- N is in 4 or 5
- No A, B, C, D, L, R, S

Let me systematically check:

Words with O in 2:
_ O _ _ _

E in 1:
E O _ _ _
N in 4 or 5:
E O _ N _ or E O _ _ N

E O _ N _:
E O M N _ - need fifth letter, but we have only 4 positions filled. Actually this is 5 letters: E(1), O(2), M(3), N(4), and need fifth letter - but that would be 5 letters. So E O M N _ implies the word is EOMN_ which doesn't exist.

E O _ _ N:
Need 3rd and 4th letters. Possible: E O M A N - A invalid. E O M I N - ""EOMIN"" - invalid. E O M E N - ""EOMEN"" - invalid.

E in 3:
_ O E _ _
N in 4 or 5:
_ O E N _ or _ O E _ N

_ O E N _:
Possible first letter: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
FOEN_ - no. GOEN_ - no. HOEN_ - no. MOEN_ - no. POEN_ - no. TOEN_ - no.

_ O E _ N:
FOETN - invalid. GOETN - invalid. MOETN - invalid. POETN - invalid.

This suggests I may have missed a word. Let me search more carefully.

Actually, the word ""TOEIN"" exists (toe-in in automotive alignment), but it has I which is allowed.

TOEIN:
T, O, E, I, N
Check:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 3 (valid, not 4 or 5)
N in 5 (valid, not 3)
Letters: T, O, E, I, N - none eliminated.

Another candidate: HOMER - but R is eliminated.

POKEN - but K is allowed, but is it a word? ""Poken"" is a proper noun.

FOGEY - F, O, G, E, Y
Check:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 4 - invalid (from CONED).

WOKEN - W, O, K, E, N
Check:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 4 - invalid.

YOKEN - invalid.

GOMEN - G, O, M, E, N
Check:
O in 2 (✓)
E in 4 - invalid.

Thus, the only valid candidate I can find is TOEIN.

However, TOEIN might be considered obscure. Let me check if there's another.

Another approach: _ O _ _ N with E in 1,3, or 5 (but E can't be 5).
E O _ _ N - as above, no valid word.

_ O _ N E - but E can't be 5.

_ O _ E N - this fits:
Need O in 2, E in 4 (invalid), so no.

Wait, the only remaining valid structure is _ O E _ N with E in 3.

The word is _ O E _ N:
Possible first letters: T, F, G, etc.
TOEIN is the only one I find.

Alternatively, _ O _ N _ with E in 1:
E O _ N _ - but needs 5 letters: E O M N _ - no valid word.

Upon reflection, the word must be TOEIN based on constraints.

But to be thorough, let me check other possibilities:

- VENOM - O not in 2
- MONEY - E in 4 (invalid)
- GONER - R invalid
- HONED - D invalid
- TONED - D invalid
- CONEY - C invalid
- SLOPE - S, L invalid
- FLOPE - L invalid

Thus, TOEIN appears to be the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,woken,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possible vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - many common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - similar idea)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage)
- ADIEU (many vowels, but less consonant coverage)

Among these, AROSE is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for the first guess to see which letters might be present in the secret word.

Another solid option is SLATE, which has S, L, A, T, E. Between these, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage and R/S are very common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
2. Contains O and E somewhere, but:
   - O is not in the 3rd position.
   - E is not in the 5th position.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters we know ARE in the word: O, E (but at unknown positions)

Now for the next guess, we want to:
- Include O and E in different positions than before
- Avoid A, R, S
- Try to introduce new common consonants to test for presence

Good letters to test next: common consonants like L, N, T, D, C, etc., and maybe another vowel like I or U.

A good candidate word would use O and E in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try ""OCEAN"" but that has C and N (good) but also A which we know is not in the word. So that's bad.

Next idea: ""OFTEN"" - but it has F and T and N, but E is in 5th position which we know is wrong. So E needs to move.

""DOING"" - has D, I, N, G, but missing E.

""ELBOW"" - has E in 1st, L, B, O, W - E in 1st is new, O in 4th is new, introduces L, B, W.

""BLOKE"" - B, L, O, K, E - O in 3rd is same as before which is wrong, so no.

""POKED"" - P, O, K, E, D - O in 2nd is new, E in 4th is new, introduces P, K, D.

This seems good - positions O(2) and E(4) are new, and introduces P, K, D which are new letters not tested yet.

Alternatively ""TOWER"" - but has R which we know is out.

""CLOVE"" - has C, L, O, V, E - O in 3rd is same as before (invalid), so no.

""VOICE"" - V, O, I, C, E - O in 2nd, E in 5th is invalid (E can't be 5th).

""DOPEY"" - D, O, P, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th - both new positions, introduces D, P, Y.

""LOWED"" - L, O, W, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces L, W, D.

Between POKED and LOWED, POKED introduces P and K which are slightly less common, while LOWED introduces L and W. Both are good, but let's go with LOWED as L is very common.

Wait - LOWED has E in 5th which we know is invalid. So E is in 4th here which is OK (feedback said E is not in 5th, so 4th is fine).

But LOWED is actually E in 4th, so that's OK. But looking back POKED has E in 4th too.

Another option: ""MONEY"" - M, O, N, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces M, N, Y.

But MONEY has E in 5th which is invalid. So no.

""CONED"" - C, O, N, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces C, N, D.

This seems good - all letters new, O and E in new positions.

I think CONED is a strong next guess.

<guess>CONED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CONED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(x)  R(x)  O(-)  S(x)  E(-)

Round 2 – CONED  
C(x)  O(✓)  N(-)  E(✓)  D(x)

What we now know:

1. Must contain both O and E.  
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. Letters that have been eliminated:
   A, R, S, C, D (and positions for O and E are partially fixed).

3. Letters that remain possible include:  
   B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. From Guess 2 we also learned N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 4.
- N somewhere except position 3.
- No A, R, S, C, D.

A quick scan of common consonant-vowel patterns suggests trying:
B, L, T, M, G, P, etc.

Candidates:  
BONEY  – B, O, N, E, Y → E is in 4th (invalid).  
BONGE – not a valid word.  
TONEY – T, O, N, E, Y → E in 4th (invalid).  
GONER – G, O, N, E, R → R eliminated.  
MONTE – M, O, N, T, E → N in 3rd is invalid.  
PONTE – same issue with N in 3rd.  
LONGE – valid word? Yes, LONGE is an English word (a training rein).  
Check positions: L, O, N, G, E → N is in 3rd (invalid).  
JONES – J, O, N, E, S → S eliminated.  
HONEY – H, O, N, E, Y → E in 4th (invalid).  
BONGE – invalid.  

Try shifting N later:  
BOGNE – invalid.  
BOGEN – invalid.  
BOVNE – invalid.  

Re-evaluate: maybe N does not appear at all? But feedback says N is in the word (but wrong position). So N must be present but not in 3rd.  

Word must have N in 1st, 4th or 5th.  

Examples:  
N O _ _ E – impossible, O already in 2nd.  
_ O N _ E – but N would be 3rd again.  
_ O _ N E – N 4th, E 5th: that satisfies N not in 3rd and E not in 4th.  
_ O _ _ N – E must fit somewhere.  

So structure: O in 2, N in 4 or 5, E in 1,3 or 5.  

Let’s try N in 4th and E in 1st: E O _ N _  
Need two valid consonants in 3rd and 5th, no C, D, R, S, A.  
E O M N T – invalid (T at 5th).  
E O M N G – invalid.  

N in 5th and E in 1st: E O _ _ N  
E O B L N – invalid.  

E in 3rd and N in 5th: _ O E _ N  
B O E L N – invalid.  

E in 5th and N in 1st: N O _ _ E  
N O B L E – valid word!  
Check constraints:  
Letters: N, O, B, L, E – none of eliminated letters.  
Positions:  
O in 2 (correct) ✓  
N in 1 (not 3) ✓  
E in 5 (not 4) ✓  

NOBLE satisfies all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,woken,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possible vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. 

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - many common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - similar idea)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage)
- ADIEU (many vowels, but less consonant coverage)

Among these, AROSE is a strong choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for the first guess to see which letters might be present in the secret word.

Another solid option is SLATE, which has S, L, A, T, E. Between these, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly better vowel coverage and R/S are very common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
2. Contains O and E somewhere, but:
   - O is not in the 3rd position.
   - E is not in the 5th position.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters we know ARE in the word: O, E (but at unknown positions)

Now for the next guess, we want to:
- Include O and E in different positions than before
- Avoid A, R, S
- Try to introduce new common consonants to test for presence

Good letters to test next: common consonants like L, N, T, D, C, etc., and maybe another vowel like I or U.

A good candidate word would use O and E in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try ""OCEAN"" but that has C and N (good) but also A which we know is not in the word. So that's bad.

Next idea: ""OFTEN"" - but it has F and T and N, but E is in 5th position which we know is wrong. So E needs to move.

""DOING"" - has D, I, N, G, but missing E.

""ELBOW"" - has E in 1st, L, B, O, W - E in 1st is new, O in 4th is new, introduces L, B, W.

""BLOKE"" - B, L, O, K, E - O in 3rd is same as before which is wrong, so no.

""POKED"" - P, O, K, E, D - O in 2nd is new, E in 4th is new, introduces P, K, D.

This seems good - positions O(2) and E(4) are new, and introduces P, K, D which are new letters not tested yet.

Alternatively ""TOWER"" - but has R which we know is out.

""CLOVE"" - has C, L, O, V, E - O in 3rd is same as before (invalid), so no.

""VOICE"" - V, O, I, C, E - O in 2nd, E in 5th is invalid (E can't be 5th).

""DOPEY"" - D, O, P, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th - both new positions, introduces D, P, Y.

""LOWED"" - L, O, W, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces L, W, D.

Between POKED and LOWED, POKED introduces P and K which are slightly less common, while LOWED introduces L and W. Both are good, but let's go with LOWED as L is very common.

Wait - LOWED has E in 5th which we know is invalid. So E is in 4th here which is OK (feedback said E is not in 5th, so 4th is fine).

But LOWED is actually E in 4th, so that's OK. But looking back POKED has E in 4th too.

Another option: ""MONEY"" - M, O, N, E, Y - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces M, N, Y.

But MONEY has E in 5th which is invalid. So no.

""CONED"" - C, O, N, E, D - O in 2nd, E in 4th, introduces C, N, D.

This seems good - all letters new, O and E in new positions.

I think CONED is a strong next guess.

Guess 2: CONED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

A(x)  R(x)  O(-)  S(x)  E(-)

Round 2 – CONED  
C(x)  O(✓)  N(-)  E(✓)  D(x)

What we now know:

1. Must contain both O and E.  
   - O is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. Letters that have been eliminated:
   A, R, S, C, D (and positions for O and E are partially fixed).

3. Letters that remain possible include:  
   B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. From Guess 2 we also learned N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 4.
- N somewhere except position 3.
- No A, R, S, C, D.

A quick scan of common consonant-vowel patterns suggests trying:
B, L, T, M, G, P, etc.

Candidates:  
BONEY  – B, O, N, E, Y → E is in 4th (invalid).  
BONGE – not a valid word.  
TONEY – T, O, N, E, Y → E in 4th (invalid).  
GONER – G, O, N, E, R → R eliminated.  
MONTE – M, O, N, T, E → N in 3rd is invalid.  
PONTE – same issue with N in 3rd.  
LONGE – valid word? Yes, LONGE is an English word (a training rein).  
Check positions: L, O, N, G, E → N is in 3rd (invalid).  
JONES – J, O, N, E, S → S eliminated.  
HONEY – H, O, N, E, Y → E in 4th (invalid).  
BONGE – invalid.  

Try shifting N later:  
BOGNE – invalid.  
BOGEN – invalid.  
BOVNE – invalid.  

Re-evaluate: maybe N does not appear at all? But feedback says N is in the word (but wrong position). So N must be present but not in 3rd.  

Word must have N in 1st, 4th or 5th.  

Examples:  
N O _ _ E – impossible, O already in 2nd.  
_ O N _ E – but N would be 3rd again.  
_ O _ N E – N 4th, E 5th: that satisfies N not in 3rd and E not in 4th.  
_ O _ _ N – E must fit somewhere.  

So structure: O in 2, N in 4 or 5, E in 1,3 or 5.  

Let’s try N in 4th and E in 1st: E O _ N _  
Need two valid consonants in 3rd and 5th, no C, D, R, S, A.  
E O M N T – invalid (T at 5th).  
E O M N G – invalid.  

N in 5th and E in 1st: E O _ _ N  
E O B L N – invalid.  

E in 3rd and N in 5th: _ O E _ N  
B O E L N – invalid.  

E in 5th and N in 1st: N O _ _ E  
N O B L E – valid word!  
Check constraints:  
Letters: N, O, B, L, E – none of eliminated letters.  
Positions:  
O in 2 (correct) ✓  
N in 1 (not 3) ✓  
E in 5 (not 4) ✓

Yes, LONGE is an English word (a training rein).  \nCheck positions: L, O, N, G, E → N is in 3rd (invalid).  \nJONES – J, O, N, E, S → S eliminated.  \nHONEY – H, O, N, E, Y → E in 4th (invalid).  \nBONGE – invalid.  \n\nTry shifting N later:  \nBOGNE – invalid.  \nBOGEN – invalid.  \nBOVNE – invalid.  \n\nRe-evaluate: maybe N does not appear at all?

Current constraints after five guesses:

1. O is locked in position 2 (✓).
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (feedback from CONED and NOBLE/TONEY); therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (feedback from CONED, NOBLE, and TONEY); therefore N must be in position 5.
4. Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, C, D, B, L, T, Y.
5. Remaining available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any unused vowels).

Word pattern:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: N (fixed from #3)
- E must be in position 1 or 3
- Positions 1/3/4: must use allowed letters

Pattern options:
a) E O _ _ N   (E in 1st)  
b) _ O E _ N   (E in 3rd)  

Check valid English words:

a) E O _ _ N  
   E O M E N (invalid - E repeats)  
   E O G A N (invalid - A eliminated)  
   E O M I N (invalid)  
   E O K E N (invalid)  
   E O F I N (invalid)  
   No valid 5-letter words starting with EO.

b) _ O E _ N  
   Possible consonants for positions 1 and 4 (from allowed list: F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Z, plus I, U as vowels).

   - M O E N N (invalid - N repeats)  
   - P O E N N (invalid)  
   - F O E N N (invalid)  
   - G O E N N (invalid)  
   - H O E N N (invalid)  
   - K O E N N (invalid)  
   - V O E N N (invalid)  
   - W O E N N (invalid)  
   - Z O E N N (invalid)  

   Realize we need a valid consonant+vowel or consonant+consonant that forms a word. The only viable word fitting this exact pattern that is valid is ""FOGEN"" (but not a valid word) or ""WOKEN"".

   Check ""WOKEN"":
   - Letters: W, O, K, E, N  
   - All letters allowed (W, K, E, N not eliminated)  
   - Positions:  
     - 1: W (allowed)  
     - 2: O (fixed ✓)  
     - 3: E (allowed in 3rd)  
     - 4: K (allowed)  
     - 5: N (fixed ✓)  
   - No eliminated letters used.  
   - Valid English word meaning ""past participle of wake"".

Thus WOKEN is the only valid next guess satisfying all constraints.
