For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) as these appear frequently in 5-letter words.

One popular choice is ""AROSE"" as it covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also hitting many common letters.

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering three vowels (though only A and E are in the word) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:

- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word (x).

The remaining four letters must avoid L, A, T, E.

1. Keeps S in the first slot (since it’s confirmed).
2. Uses as many new, common letters as possible while avoiding L, A, T, E.

Good consonants left: R, N, D, P, G, B, C, M, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out), plus Y sometimes.

A strong next word would be “SOUND”:
- Starts with S.
- Uses O, U (vowels), and N, D (consonants), none of which are ruled out.

Remaining common letters that avoid the eliminated ones and include O:

Consonants still allowed: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels still allowed: I, O (O is already known to exist), Y sometimes.

Letters we can safely use: S (fixed at 1), O (must appear somewhere), plus any of B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y.

A good next guess would place the O in a new position and introduce several fresh consonants. Let’s try:

- S P O R K → places O in position 3 and tests P, R, K, none of which are excluded.  
- S H R O W → tests H, R, W and moves O to 4.

3. P is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, U, N, D, K.

We need a letter in position 2 (cannot be P or any eliminated letter).  
We also need a letter in position 4 (cannot be any eliminated letter).  
We need position 5 (cannot be any eliminated letter).  

Good remaining consonants for positions 2, 4, 5: R, C, F, G, H, M, V, W, Y, B (but B is less common).  
Good vowels: I (since A, E, U, O are already placed or eliminated except O is in position 3).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) as these appear frequently in 5-letter words.

One popular choice is ""AROSE"" as it covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also hitting many common letters.

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering three vowels (though only A and E are in the word) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:
- S is in the word and is the first letter (✓).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word (x).

So the word starts with S _ _ _ _.  
The remaining four letters must avoid L, A, T, E.

To maximize information, I want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps S in the first slot (since it’s confirmed).
2. Uses as many new, common letters as possible while avoiding L, A, T, E.

Good consonants left: R, N, D, P, G, B, C, M, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out), plus Y sometimes.

A strong next word would be “SOUND”:
- Starts with S.
- Uses O, U (vowels), and N, D (consonants), none of which are ruled out.

This gives us new letters to test (O, U, N, D) in positions 2-5.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses:

1. SLATE → S ✓ (position 1), L x, A x, T x, E x  
2. SOUND → S ✓ (position 1), O – (in word, wrong spot), U x, N x, D x  

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- O is somewhere in positions 2-5, and A, L, T, E, U, N, D are all out.

Remaining common letters that avoid the eliminated ones and include O:

Consonants still allowed: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(But we want common ones.)  
Vowels still allowed: I, O (O is already known to exist), Y sometimes.

Letters we can safely use: S (fixed at 1), O (must appear somewhere), plus any of B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y.

A good next guess would place the O in a new position and introduce several fresh consonants. Let’s try:

- S P O R K → places O in position 3 and tests P, R, K, none of which are excluded.  
- S H R O W → tests H, R, W and moves O to 4.  
- S C R O W → tests C, R, W and puts O in 5.

Among these, S P O R K uses P, R, K and places O in 3. It’s common and spreads the remaining letters nicely.

Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

Word pattern so far
Position 1: S (✓)
Position 2: C (✓)
Position 3: O (✓)
Positions 4–5: ?

Letters known to be in the word
- S, C, O
- P (from Guess 3 and 4 feedback shows P is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 4; therefore P must be in position 5)

Letters ruled out
L, A, T, E, U, N, D, K, Y (plus anything that appeared with an x)

That leaves the pattern: S C O _ P

Only the 4th letter is unknown; it cannot be any of the ruled-out letters or S, C, O, P (which are already placed).  
Allowed remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, M, R, V, W

We want a valid 5-letter English word of the form S C O _ P. Common choices:

- S C O R P → “SCORP” is not a standard word.
- S C O U P → “SCOUP” not valid.
- S C O O P → “SCOOP” uses O again (allowed, but let’s check)
- S C O W P → invalid
- S C O B P → invalid
- S C O M P → “SCOMP” invalid
- S C O F P → invalid
- S C O G P → invalid
- S C O H P → invalid
- S C O I P → invalid
- S C O R P → see above
- S C O V P → invalid
- S C O W P → invalid

The only common, valid word of this exact pattern is “SCOOP”.

Let me verify:
- S C O O P
- S(✓) C(✓) O(✓) O(-) P(✓) — the second O would now be tested in position 4; if the secret word has only one O, the second O would get (-) or (x). But we already confirmed O must be in position 3. That’s fine; we’re just filling slot 4.

Therefore the logical next and likely final guess is:
