For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Contains vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E - also very common)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E - good vowel coverage)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - includes L which is also common)

I'll go with STARE as it uses 5 of the top 7 most common letters (E, A, R, S, T) and has no repeating letters.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (first letter).
- T, A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- starts with S
- does not contain T, A, R, E
- has 4 remaining letters to determine (positions 2-5)
- only letters we haven't tried yet (from common letters) are: I, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

Since we've eliminated A and E, we likely need other vowels. Possible vowels left: I, O, U.
Common consonants left: N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

I want to test multiple new common letters. Let me try:
- S _ _ _ _
- Avoid T, A, R, E
- Include I (very common vowel) and N, C, H (common consonants)

Thus, ""SINCH"" is a good candidate as it tests S (known correct), I, N, C, H while avoiding eliminated letters.

From the new feedback:

Position 1: S is correct (already known)
Position 2: C is now correct (✓)
Position 3: O is correct (✓)
Position 4: U is NOT in the word (x)
Position 5: P is correct (✓)

So the word pattern is now fully determined: S C O _ P

We just need to find the single missing letter in the 4th position.  
Letters already eliminated so far: T, A, R, E, I, N, H, U  
Letters that have appeared and are thus still allowed: S, C, O, P  
Other still-allowed common consonants/vowels: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a five-letter English word that fits S C O _ P.  
The only common word that fits is S C O **L** P → ""SCOLP"". However, ""scolp"" is not a standard English word (it's an archaic or dialectal form of ""scalp"", not in common modern usage).

The actual standard English word that matches S C O _ P is **SCOOP**, but that would repeat O in position 4, which is already in position 3. This is allowed unless there's evidence against it, but we have no feedback against double letters.

Wait - let me double-check: is there another common word?  
- SCOP (4 letters) → too short  
- SCOLD → doesn't end with P  
- SCOFF → doesn't fit  
- SCOOP → S C O O P → this is the only plausible candidate.

Thus, the word must be SCOOP.
