For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" covers many of these letters, but since we don't know the word yet, any common word will work. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Feedback recap:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the last letter in CRANE).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
- Does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next guess strategy:
1. Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
2. Keep E but place it somewhere other than position 5.
3. Pick common letters not yet tried (S, T, L, O, I, U, D, Y, etc.) to gather more information.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules and introduces new common consonants and vowels is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E – none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- E appears in position 5 again, but since we already know E is in the word and just not in position 5, this is acceptable for information-gathering (though ideally we’d move E earlier). However, moving E to an earlier spot in the same word would weaken the spread of new letters.

A better alternative is ""MUTED"":
- M, U, T, E, D – none of these are ruled out.
- E is in position 4, so it satisfies the ""not in position 5"" rule and tests a new position for E.

I’ll go with ""MUTED"".

So far we know:
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D  
- E is definitely in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it appeared in both guesses at those slots and was only “-”).

Hence the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain any of C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D.

Let’s pick a fresh set of common letters while respecting those constraints.  
Good unused letters include S, L, O, I, B, F, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

A word that places E in a new spot (position 3) and uses several new, common letters is “WHOSE”.

Check each letter:
- W, H, O, S haven’t been tried yet.
- E is in position 3 (new placement).
- No banned letters appear.

That seems optimal for information gathering.

Let’s tabulate what the three guesses have told us.

Letters already ruled out (x feedback):
C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D, H, O, W

Letters whose status is still unknown:
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus the ones that have only gotten the “-” mark.

Letters that we know are in the word somewhere (only “-” feedback):
E, S, W

Positions for these “in-word” letters so far:

E: tried in positions 5 (CRANE), 4 (MUTED), 3 (WHOSE) → still only “-” → E must be in position 1 or 2.

S: tried in position 4 (WHOSE) → “-” → S must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

W: tried in position 1 (WHOSE) → “-” → W must be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

Constraints now:
- The word contains exactly E, S, W somewhere.
- No letter from the ruled-out list.
- E must be in slot 1 or 2.
- S not in slot 4.
- W not in slot 1.

We still have 3 open slots left to fill with letters that have not been tried and are not yet ruled out.  Common unused letters include: B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V (and others, but let’s stick with common ones).

Let me construct candidates manually:

Candidate 1: E S _ _ _  
  E in slot 1.  
  S must go in slot 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is adjacent to E and might not yield a word).  
  Example: E S _ _ _ → ESPIE (invalid duplicate E), ESPY (4 letters).  Not 5-letter words.  
  E S _ L _ → ESLIP? not valid.  
  E S _ I _ → ESILY? not valid.  
  This branch is weak.

Candidate 2: W E _ _ _  
  W must not be 1, but here it would be 1 → violates W feedback.  So WE is only possible if W is in 2+.  But E must be in 1 or 2.

Thus we need either:
  E W _ _ _  (E at 1, W at 2)  
  or W E _ _ _ (E at 2, W at 1) – but W at 1 is invalid from WHOSE feedback → only E W _ _ _ is possible.

Next: we must place S somewhere not 4.  Possible positions for S: 3, 4, 5, but 4 is excluded → positions 3 or 5.

Let’s try E W S _ _ → EWSIE invalid.  
E W _ S _ → E W _ S _ → need valid word.

E W L S _ → EWLS_? no.  
E W I S _ → EWIS_? no.  
E W B S _ → EWBST? no.

Maybe E W _ _ S → E W I L S → EWILS? not valid.

Alternative: place S first, then E second, then W third.

S E W _ _ → SEW _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set.

Common letters left: B, F, G, I, K, L, V, Y.

SEWEL?  L is allowed, E is already in word, but L is new.  
SEWEL is not a common word listed in many Scrabble/Wordle lists.  
SEWED?  D is ruled out.

Another path: start with W in position 2, E in position 1.

E W S _ _ → already considered.

Let me step back and just ensure we pick a valid 5-letter word satisfying constraints.

Satisfying constraints:
- Must contain E, S, W exactly once each.
- May contain other letters only from unused set: B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, Y, etc.
- E must be in 1 or 2.
- S not in 4.
- W not in 1.

Consider word “SWEET” – but T is out, E repeated.  
“PEWSE” – P, E, W, S, E → double E and T not involved, but P and E are ok, but W and S are both in word, but E is repeated – but we know E appears only once (no feedback for duplicates).  
“SPEWS” – S, P, E, W, S → double S.

We can only have E, S, W once each plus any other allowed letters.

Valid single-occurrence word:  
Letters available: E, S, W plus up to two more distinct letters from {B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, Y}.

Try “SWEPT” – T is out.  
“SWYPE” – Y, P allowed, but Y and P are new.  Check if SWYPE is a valid 5-letter word: yes (variant spelling of swipe).  
Positions: S-1, W-2, Y-3, P-4, E-5.

But E has to be in position 1 or 2; here it is 5 → invalid.

Next idea: E in 1, W in 2, S in 3, plus two new allowed letters in 4 and 5.

EWISP?  I, S, P – but S already used.  
EWISK?  K is allowed, word is valid.

EWISK: valid?  Not a standard English word, but let me check Scrabble list: EWISK is not recognized.

EWILK?  No.  
Let’s try E W I S _ → EWIS_ invalid.

Switch to E in 1, S in 3, W in 4.

E _ S W _ → need two more letters.  
E L S W Y?  Not valid.

E B S W I?  Not valid.

Next possibility: E in 2, W in 3, S in 1.

S _ E W _ → S P E W S?  Double S.

S L E W S?  Double S.

S L E W Y?  Y allowed.  Word: SLEWY?  Not listed.

S P E W N?  N ruled out.

S P E W Y?  Not valid.

Another structure: E in 1, S in 5, W somewhere.

E _ _ _ S → need W in 2, 3, or 4.

E W _ _ S → E W B L S?  Not valid.

E _ W _ S → E I W L S?  Not valid.

E _ _ W S → E I L W S?  Not valid.

This is getting tedious; let’s just find a known word.

Recall that S and W are required, E must be in 1 or 2.

Valid word that meets all:  
“PEWSE” – already considered: P-E-W-S-E, but E appears twice (feedback never indicated duplicates).  
“SPEWS” – S-P-E-W-S, S twice.  
“SWEPT” – T out.

“SEWED” – D out.

“SWELL” – L allowed, but L is new, E is ok, but L appears twice and E appears once.  Still L is OK, but double L is acceptable in English.

But SWELL: S-W-E-L-L → letters: S, W, E, plus L twice.  
We have no info on L yet, and only single E, so this is allowed.

Positions: S-1, W-2, E-3, L-4, L-5.  But E is in 3, which we already tried and got “-” (WHOSE had E in 3 and it was “-”), so E cannot be in 3.  Thus SWELL is invalid.

Another known word: “YELPS” – Y-E-L-P-S.  
Letters: Y, E, L, P, S.  
Contains E, S and W is missing → invalid.

We need a word that has exactly E, S, W plus any other allowed letters.

“YEWPS” – Y-E-W-P-S.  This contains Y, E, W, P, S.  
Letters used: Y, E, W, P, S – all allowed.  
Positions: Y-1, E-2, W-3, P-4, S-5.

Constraints:
- E is in 2 – allowed (we only know it is not 3,4,5).  
- W is in 3 – allowed (it must not be 1).  
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 4).  
- Letters not in the banned list.

Word “YEWPS” is valid (Scrabble list).  

So this is a strong candidate.

Let me final-check:
- Contains E, S, W exactly once each.  
- No banned letters.  
- E in 2, W in 3, S in 5 – all allowed positions based on feedback.

Therefore, next guess: YEWPS.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,swell,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" covers many of these letters, but since we don't know the word yet, any common word will work. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - a good mix of vowels and consonants.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the last letter in CRANE).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
- Does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next guess strategy:
1. Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
2. Keep E but place it somewhere other than position 5.
3. Pick common letters not yet tried (S, T, L, O, I, U, D, Y, etc.) to gather more information.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules and introduces new common consonants and vowels is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E – none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- E appears in position 5 again, but since we already know E is in the word and just not in position 5, this is acceptable for information-gathering (though ideally we’d move E earlier). However, moving E to an earlier spot in the same word would weaken the spread of new letters.

A better alternative is ""MUTED"":
- M, U, T, E, D – none of these are ruled out.
- E is in position 4, so it satisfies the ""not in position 5"" rule and tests a new position for E.

I’ll go with ""MUTED"".

<guess>MUTED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MUTED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(x) T(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D  
- E is definitely in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it appeared in both guesses at those slots and was only “-”).

Hence the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain any of C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D.

Let’s pick a fresh set of common letters while respecting those constraints.  
Good unused letters include S, L, O, I, B, F, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

A word that places E in a new spot (position 3) and uses several new, common letters is “WHOSE”.

Check each letter:
- W, H, O, S haven’t been tried yet.
- E is in position 3 (new placement).
- No banned letters appear.

That seems optimal for information gathering.

Switch to E in 1, S in 3, W in 4.

E _ S W _ → need two more letters.  
E L S W Y?  Not valid.

E B S W I?  Not valid.

Next possibility: E in 2, W in 3, S in 1.

S _ E W _ → S P E W S?  Double S.

S L E W S?  Double S.

S L E W Y?  Y allowed.  Word: SLEWY?  Not listed.

S P E W N?  N ruled out.

S P E W Y?  Not valid.

Another structure: E in 1, S in 5, W somewhere.

E _ _ _ S → need W in 2, 3, or 4.

E W _ _ S → E W B L S?  Not valid.

E _ W _ S → E I W L S?  Not valid.

E _ _ W S → E I L W S?  Not valid.

This is getting tedious; let’s just find a known word.

Recall that S and W are required, E must be in 1 or 2.

Valid word that meets all:  
“PEWSE” – already considered: P-E-W-S-E, but E appears twice (feedback never indicated duplicates).  
“SPEWS” – S-P-E-W-S, S twice.  
“SWEPT” – T out.

“SEWED” – D out.

“SWELL” – L allowed, but L is new, E is ok, but L appears twice and E appears once.  Still L is OK, but double L is acceptable in English.

But SWELL: S-W-E-L-L → letters: S, W, E, plus L twice.  
We have no info on L yet, and only single E, so this is allowed.

Positions: S-1, W-2, E-3, L-4, L-5.  But E is in 3, which we already tried and got “-” (WHOSE had E in 3 and it was “-”), so E cannot be in 3.  Thus SWELL is invalid.

Another known word: “YELPS” – Y-E-L-P-S.  
Letters: Y, E, L, P, S.  
Contains E, S and W is missing → invalid.

We need a word that has exactly E, S, W plus any other allowed letters.

“YEWPS” – Y-E-W-P-S.  This contains Y, E, W, P, S.  
Letters used: Y, E, W, P, S – all allowed.  
Positions: Y-1, E-2, W-3, P-4, S-5.

Constraints:
- E is in 2 – allowed (we only know it is not 3,4,5).  
- W is in 3 – allowed (it must not be 1).  
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 4).  
- Letters not in the banned list.

Word “YEWPS” is valid (Scrabble list).  

So this is a strong candidate.

Let me final-check:
- Contains E, S, W exactly once each.  
- No banned letters.  
- E in 2, W in 3, S in 5 – all allowed positions based on feedback.

Therefore, next guess: YEWPS.

Recap of what we now know (after 4 guesses):

Letters ruled out completely (marked “x”):
C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D, H, O, Y, P

Letters we know are in the word (marked “-” at least once):
E, S, W

Allowed positions so far:
- E must be in 1 or 2 (it appeared in 3,4,5 and was always “-”).
- W must be in 2, 3, 4 or 5 (it appeared in 1 and was “-”).
- S must be in 1, 2, 3 or 5 (it appeared in 4 and was “-”).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains each of E, S, W exactly once.
- May contain up to two more letters chosen only from the un-tried, still-allowed set:
  B, F, G, I, K, L, V, Z (all others have been ruled out).

Try to place E, S, W in compatible positions.

One systematic way:
Enumerate all 5!/(2!) = 60 permutations of the multiset {E,S,W,_,_} with the blank slots filled by allowed consonants, then pick a valid English word.

Instead, let’s construct directly.

Case: E in 1
- Then W and S must go in 2-5 without violating their restrictions.
  - W cannot be 1 (already safe), S cannot be 4.
  - Valid permutations: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) excluding cases where S=4 or W=1.
  - Try to build words:

  - E S W _ _  → ESW??  Need two consonants from B,F,G,I,K,L,V.
    ESWIG  (G is allowed) – valid English word.
      Letters: E,S,W,I,G – all allowed so far.

  - E W S _ _  → EWS??  EWSKI? Not familiar.
    EWSIG? Not a word.
  
  - E _ S W _  → E _ S W _  → e.g., ELSWP? Not a word.

  - E _ _ S W  → E _ _ S W  → EKISW etc., unlikely.

  ESWIG seems the best candidate here.

Case: E in 2
- Then W and S must go in 1,3,4,5 with restrictions:
  - W cannot be 1 (from WHOSE feedback), S cannot be 4.
  - Possible (S,W) positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,1) invalid (W cannot be 1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1) invalid, (4,3), (4,5), (5,1) invalid, (5,3), (5,4).

  Build words:
  - S E W _ _  → SEW??  SEWEL not common, SEWUP? P ruled out.
  - _ E S W _  → BESWL? Not a word.
  - _ E _ S W  → LESKW? Not a word.
  - _ E W S _  → FEWS_?  FEWSK? Not standard.

None of these seem as solid as ESWIG.

Therefore, ESWIG is the most straightforward valid guess that satisfies every constraint.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" covers many of these letters, but since we don't know the word yet, any common word will work. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - a good mix of vowels and consonants.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the last letter in CRANE).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
- Does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next guess strategy:
1. Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
2. Keep E but place it somewhere other than position 5.
3. Pick common letters not yet tried (S, T, L, O, I, U, D, Y, etc.) to gather more information.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules and introduces new common consonants and vowels is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E – none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- E appears in position 5 again, but since we already know E is in the word and just not in position 5, this is acceptable for information-gathering (though ideally we’d move E earlier). However, moving E to an earlier spot in the same word would weaken the spread of new letters.

A better alternative is ""MUTED"":
- M, U, T, E, D – none of these are ruled out.
- E is in position 4, so it satisfies the ""not in position 5"" rule and tests a new position for E.

I’ll go with ""MUTED"".

<guess>MUTED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MUTED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(x) T(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D  
- E is definitely in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it appeared in both guesses at those slots and was only “-”).

Hence the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain any of C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D.

Let’s pick a fresh set of common letters while respecting those constraints.  
Good unused letters include S, L, O, I, B, F, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

A word that places E in a new spot (position 3) and uses several new, common letters is “WHOSE”.

Check each letter:
- W, H, O, S haven’t been tried yet.
- E is in position 3 (new placement).
- No banned letters appear.

That seems optimal for information gathering.

C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D, H, O, W

Letters whose status is still unknown:
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus the ones that have only gotten the “-” mark.

Letters that we know are in the word somewhere (only “-” feedback):
E, S, W

Positions for these “in-word” letters so far:

E: tried in positions 5 (CRANE), 4 (MUTED), 3 (WHOSE) → still only “-” → E must be in position 1 or 2.

S: tried in position 4 (WHOSE) → “-” → S must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.

W: tried in position 1 (WHOSE) → “-” → W must be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

Constraints now:
- The word contains exactly E, S, W somewhere.
- No letter from the ruled-out list.
- E must be in slot 1 or 2.
- S not in slot 4.
- W not in slot 1.

We still have 3 open slots left to fill with letters that have not been tried and are not yet ruled out.  Common unused letters include: B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V (and others, but let’s stick with common ones).

Let me construct candidates manually:

Candidate 1: E S _ _ _  
  E in slot 1.  
  S must go in slot 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is adjacent to E and might not yield a word).  
  Example: E S _ _ _ → ESPIE (invalid duplicate E), ESPY (4 letters).  Not 5-letter words.  
  E S _ L _ → ESLIP? not valid.  
  E S _ I _ → ESILY? not valid.  
  This branch is weak.

Candidate 2: W E _ _ _  
  W must not be 1, but here it would be 1 → violates W feedback.  So WE is only possible if W is in 2+.  But E must be in 1 or 2.

Thus we need either:
  E W _ _ _  (E at 1, W at 2)  
  or W E _ _ _ (E at 2, W at 1) – but W at 1 is invalid from WHOSE feedback → only E W _ _ _ is possible.

Next: we must place S somewhere not 4.  Possible positions for S: 3, 4, 5, but 4 is excluded → positions 3 or 5.

Let’s try E W S _ _ → EWSIE invalid.  
E W _ S _ → E W _ S _ → need valid word.

E W L S _ → EWLS_? no.  
E W I S _ → EWIS_? no.  
E W B S _ → EWBST? no.

Maybe E W _ _ S → E W I L S → EWILS? not valid.

Alternative: place S first, then E second, then W third.

S E W _ _ → SEW _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set.

Common letters left: B, F, G, I, K, L, V, Y.

SEWEL?  L is allowed, E is already in word, but L is new.  
SEWEL is not a common word listed in many Scrabble/Wordle lists.  
SEWED?  D is ruled out.

Another path: start with W in position 2, E in position 1.

E W S _ _ → already considered.

Let me step back and just ensure we pick a valid 5-letter word satisfying constraints.

Satisfying constraints:
- Must contain E, S, W exactly once each.
- May contain other letters only from unused set: B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, Y, etc.
- E must be in 1 or 2.
- S not in 4.
- W not in 1.

Consider word “SWEET” – but T is out, E repeated.  
“PEWSE” – P, E, W, S, E → double E and T not involved, but P and E are ok, but W and S are both in word, but E is repeated – but we know E appears only once (no feedback for duplicates).  
“SPEWS” – S, P, E, W, S → double S.

We can only have E, S, W once each plus any other allowed letters.

Valid single-occurrence word:  
Letters available: E, S, W plus up to two more distinct letters from {B, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, Y}.

Try “SWEPT” – T is out.  
“SWYPE” – Y, P allowed, but Y and P are new.  Check if SWYPE is a valid 5-letter word: yes (variant spelling of swipe).  
Positions: S-1, W-2, Y-3, P-4, E-5.

But E has to be in position 1 or 2; here it is 5 → invalid.

Next idea: E in 1, W in 2, S in 3, plus two new allowed letters in 4 and 5.

EWISP?  I, S, P – but S already used.  
EWISK?  K is allowed, word is valid.

EWISK: valid?  Not a standard English word, but let me check Scrabble list: EWISK is not recognized.

EWILK?  No.  
Let’s try E W I S _ → EWIS_ invalid.

Switch to E in 1, S in 3, W in 4.

E _ S W _ → need two more letters.  
E L S W Y?  Not valid.

E B S W I?  Not valid.

Next possibility: E in 2, W in 3, S in 1.

S _ E W _ → S P E W S?  Double S.

S L E W S?  Double S.

S L E W Y?  Y allowed.  Word: SLEWY?  Not listed.

S P E W N?  N ruled out.

S P E W Y?  Not valid.

Another structure: E in 1, S in 5, W somewhere.

E _ _ _ S → need W in 2, 3, or 4.

E W _ _ S → E W B L S?  Not valid.

E _ W _ S → E I W L S?  Not valid.

E _ _ W S → E I L W S?  Not valid.

This is getting tedious; let’s just find a known word.

Recall that S and W are required, E must be in 1 or 2.

Valid word that meets all:  
“PEWSE” – already considered: P-E-W-S-E, but E appears twice (feedback never indicated duplicates).  
“SPEWS” – S-P-E-W-S, S twice.  
“SWEPT” – T out.

“SEWED” – D out.

“SWELL” – L allowed, but L is new, E is ok, but L appears twice and E appears once.  Still L is OK, but double L is acceptable in English.

But SWELL: S-W-E-L-L → letters: S, W, E, plus L twice.  
We have no info on L yet, and only single E, so this is allowed.

Positions: S-1, W-2, E-3, L-4, L-5.  But E is in 3, which we already tried and got “-” (WHOSE had E in 3 and it was “-”), so E cannot be in 3.  Thus SWELL is invalid.

Another known word: “YELPS” – Y-E-L-P-S.  
Letters: Y, E, L, P, S.  
Contains E, S and W is missing → invalid.

We need a word that has exactly E, S, W plus any other allowed letters.

“YEWPS” – Y-E-W-P-S.  This contains Y, E, W, P, S.  
Letters used: Y, E, W, P, S – all allowed.  
Positions: Y-1, E-2, W-3, P-4, S-5.

Constraints:
- E is in 2 – allowed (we only know it is not 3,4,5).  
- W is in 3 – allowed (it must not be 1).  
- S is in 5 – allowed (not 4).  
- Letters not in the banned list.

Word “YEWPS” is valid (Scrabble list).  

So this is a strong candidate.

Let me final-check:
- Contains E, S, W exactly once each.  
- No banned letters.  
- E in 2, W in 3, S in 5 – all allowed positions based on feedback.

Therefore, next guess: YEWPS.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Recap of what we now know (after 4 guesses):

Letters ruled out completely (marked “x”):
C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D, H, O, Y, P

Letters we know are in the word (marked “-” at least once):
E, S, W

Allowed positions so far:
- E must be in 1 or 2 (it appeared in 3,4,5 and was always “-”).
- W must be in 2, 3, 4 or 5 (it appeared in 1 and was “-”).
- S must be in 1, 2, 3 or 5 (it appeared in 4 and was “-”).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains each of E, S, W exactly once.
- May contain up to two more letters chosen only from the un-tried, still-allowed set:
  B, F, G, I, K, L, V, Z (all others have been ruled out).

Try to place E, S, W in compatible positions.

One systematic way:
Enumerate all 5!/(2!) = 60 permutations of the multiset {E,S,W,_,_} with the blank slots filled by allowed consonants, then pick a valid English word.

Instead, let’s construct directly.

Case: E in 1
- Then W and S must go in 2-5 without violating their restrictions.
  - W cannot be 1 (already safe), S cannot be 4.
  - Valid permutations: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) excluding cases where S=4 or W=1.
  - Try to build words:

  - E S W _ _  → ESW??  Need two consonants from B,F,G,I,K,L,V.
    ESWIG  (G is allowed) – valid English word.
      Letters: E,S,W,I,G – all allowed so far.

  - E W S _ _  → EWS??  EWSKI? Not familiar.
    EWSIG? Not a word.
  
  - E _ S W _  → E _ S W _  → e.g., ELSWP? Not a word.

  - E _ _ S W  → E _ _ S W  → EKISW etc., unlikely.

  ESWIG seems the best candidate here.

Case: E in 2
- Then W and S must go in 1,3,4,5 with restrictions:
  - W cannot be 1 (from WHOSE feedback), S cannot be 4.
  - Possible (S,W) positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,1) invalid (W cannot be 1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1) invalid, (4,3), (4,5), (5,1) invalid, (5,3), (5,4).

  Build words:
  - S E W _ _  → SEW??  SEWEL not common, SEWUP? P ruled out.
  - _ E S W _  → BESWL? Not a word.
  - _ E _ S W  → LESKW? Not a word.
  - _ E W S _  → FEWS_?  FEWSK? Not standard.

None of these seem as solid as ESWIG.

Therefore, ESWIG is the most straightforward valid guess that satisfies every constraint.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback in any slot):
C, R, A, N, M, U, T, D, H, O, Y, P, I, G

Letters that are definitely IN the word (every appearance has been marked “-”):
E, S, W

Allowed positions so far:
- E must be in 1 or 2 (it has been in 3,4,5 and always received “-”)
- S must be in 1, 2, 3, 5 (received “-” while in 4)
- W must be in 2, 3, 4, 5 (received “-” while in 1)

We therefore need a 5-letter word that uses exactly E, S, W plus **only** the still-untried letters.  
The remaining consonants that have NOT been ruled out are:
B, F, K, L, V, Z  (others may exist but are much rarer).

We need two more distinct letters from that small set, and we must place E, S, W in compatible positions.

Enumerating valid permutations:

1. E in 1 ⇒ possible S/W placements:
   - S2 W3 → E S W _ _  → need two letters from {B,F,K,L,V,Z}  
     E S W B L  → ESWBL? Not a word.  
     E S W F L  → ESWFL? No.  
   - S2 W4 → E S _ W _ → ESBWL? No.  
   - S2 W5 → E S _ _ W → ESLKW? No.

2. E in 2 ⇒ possible S/W placements:
   - S1 W3 → S E W _ _ → SEWEL? Not valid.  
   - S1 W4 → S E _ W _ → SEBWL? No.  
   - S1 W5 → S E _ _ W → SEBKW? No.  
   - S3 W1 → impossible (W cannot be 1).  
   - S3 W4 → _ E S W _ → BESWL? No.  
   - S3 W5 → _ E _ S W → BELSW? Not valid.  
   - S4 W1 → impossible.  
   - S4 W3 → _ E W S _ → BEWSL? No.  
   - S4 W5 → _ E _ W S → BEVWS? No.  
   - S5 W1 → impossible.  
   - S5 W3 → _ _ E W S → invalid because E must be in 1 or 2.  
   - S5 W4 → _ _ E _ W → invalid.

The only plausible English-looking word that fits is **SEWEL**, but it’s non-standard.  
Another candidate that is actually listed in standard dictionaries is **SWEET**, but T is ruled out.  
Finally, **VESSE**?  Double S allowed, but E is repeated.  No new info.

Realising that every combination of the remaining letters seems to yield non-words, the only viable 5-letter English word that uses E, S, W once each plus the remaining allowed letters (without repeats) is:

FLEWS  
(letters F, L, E, W, S – all still allowed and exactly one each)

Check positions:
- E in 3 – but we know E cannot be 3.  Invalid.

Another attempt: **FLEWS** fails.

Next, **BESWS**?  Double S, non-word.

**KLEWS**?  Not a word.

**LEWKS**?  L, E, W, K, S – valid 5-letter word.

Positions:
- L (pos 1) – allowed.  
- E (pos 2) – allowed.  
- W (pos 3) – allowed.  
- K (pos 4) – not yet ruled out.  
- S (pos 5) – allowed (not in 4).

All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the correct next guess is **LEWKS**.
