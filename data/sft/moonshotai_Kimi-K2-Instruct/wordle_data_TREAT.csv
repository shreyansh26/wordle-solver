For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly gather information about which letters are in the secret word. This is a strategic move to maximize the amount of information gained from the first guess. Good starting words often contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should help me identify multiple correct letters or rule out many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word is 5 letters.
2. It contains R in position 2.
3. It contains A and E somewhere else (but not their original positions: A not position 1, E not position 5).
4. It does NOT contain O or S.

Now I need a word that fits R in the second spot, uses A and E somewhere else, and avoids O and S. A good next guess might be ""BREAD"":
- B (unknown)
- R (correct position)
- E (since E must be somewhere other than position 5, position 3 is fine)
- A (since A must be somewhere other than position 1, position 4 is fine)
- D (unknown)

This tests new letters while placing R correctly and relocating A and E to new positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This is a strategic move to maximize the amount of information gained from the first guess. Good starting words often contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should help me identify multiple correct letters or rule out many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word is 5 letters.
2. It contains R in position 2.
3. It contains A and E somewhere else (but not their original positions: A not position 1, E not position 5).
4. It does NOT contain O or S.

Now I need a word that fits R in the second spot, uses A and E somewhere else, and avoids O and S. A good next guess might be ""BREAD"":
- B (unknown)
- R (correct position)
- E (since E must be somewhere other than position 5, position 3 is fine)
- A (since A must be somewhere other than position 1, position 4 is fine)
- D (unknown)

This tests new letters while placing R correctly and relocating A and E to new positions.

From the feedback so far:

- Positions 2-5 are exactly R E A T.
- We only need the first letter.
- Letters already eliminated from position 1: A, B, C, G, O, S.
- Remaining common consonants not yet used in any guess: F, H, K, L, N, P, W, etc.

A very common word that fits _REAT is “FREAT” – but that isn’t a valid English word.
Another valid one is “TREAT” – but T is already known at position 5, and can’t appear twice unless it’s allowed (but we haven’t seen evidence of double letters).

Checking standard English 5-letter words ending in “REAT”, the most common are:
- GREAT (already guessed, G ruled out)
- TREAT (valid)
- BREATH (6 letters, too long)
- FREAK (wrong pattern, K at 5 but we have T at 5)

Therefore the only common remaining candidate is TREAT. It re-uses T, but no feedback has prohibited repeated letters so far. Worth testing.

(If TREAT is rejected, we’d next try “WREAK” or “FREAK”, but they conflict with T at 5.)

But let’s double-check: must be exactly _ R E A T, and position 1 must be untested. Letters left for position 1 include F, H, K, L, N, P, W, etc. There isn’t a common word like *HREAT*, *LREAT*, etc. Hence, TREAT seems the only plausible word. But T is already at position 5 – can it double? The rules don’t forbid.

However, the pattern is _REAT. The only valid English word is TREAT (with T at start and end). Since T is already at position 5, and we haven’t had a double-letter indication, this seems the logical choice.

But wait — the feedback for GREAT shows T(✓) at position 5. So position 5 is definitely T. Therefore position 1 cannot be T (as it would duplicate T with no evidence yet). So TREAT is invalid (would have T in position 1 and 5, but no indication of duplicates allowed).

Next candidates: “WREAK” (but we’d need _ R E A K, but position 5 is T, not K).

Realization: we have position 5 fixed as T from GREAT feedback. So the word must be ? R E A T. The only valid English word is “TREAT”, but that would place T in position 1 and 5 – possible if duplicates allowed (no evidence against).

Alternatively, “CREAT” isn’t valid, “GREAT” already ruled out.

Thus, the only valid choice left is TREAT, assuming duplicate T’s are allowed.

But perhaps I missed: are there other valid _ R E A T words? Actually, yes:
- “BREAK” has wrong ending.
- “FREAK” ends with K.
- “STEAK” wrong positions.
- Actually, the only common English word matching ?REAT is:
    - GREAT (ruled out)
    - TREAT

Hence, TREAT must be the word.

(Additionally, position 1 letters not yet tested: F, H, K, L, N, P, W, etc., but none form valid ?REAT except TREAT.)

Therefore, the next logical guess is TREAT.
