Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information to work with. My goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in strategic positions. The best opening words typically include vowels and the most common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Considering standard opening strategies, two excellent choices are:
1. ""SLATE"" - Uses S, L, A, T, E (all very common letters)
2. ""AROSE"" - Uses A, R, O, S, E (covers all major vowels plus common consonants)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- The letters are all in different positions
- It has no repeating letters
- It's a valid English word

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): the letter A exists in the target word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the target word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the target word at all.
- S(-): the letter S exists in the target word, but NOT in position 4.
- E(✓): the letter E is in the target word and is in position 5.

So we know:
1. The target word ends with E.
2. It contains A and S at least once, but not in the positions we placed them (A not at 1, S not at 4).
3. It contains neither R nor O.

Good next-step goals:
- Place A and S in positions other than 1 and 4, respectively.
- Avoid R and O.
- Try new consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet.

A solid word that satisfies these constraints is “STAGE”:
- Ends with E (position 5 ✓).
- Uses S in position 1 (allowed because S is only forbidden in position 4).
- Uses A in position 2 (allowed because A is only forbidden in position 1).
- Uses T and G, two untested consonants.
- Uses another vowel E in position 5.

However, “STAGE” repeats the letter E, which is fine, but it might be better to test new letters. Another candidate is “CHASE”:
- Ends with E.
- S in position 3 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters C and H.

“CHASE” seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

Known positions:
- The word ends with E in slot 5 (✓).

Known letters that appear somewhere in the word:
- A (not in 1, not in 3)
- C (not in 1)
- S (not in 4)

Known letters that do NOT appear at all:
- R, O, H

The word must include at least A, C, S and must NOT include R, O, H.

Possible letters still available: B D F G I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z  
(we’ve used A C E H O R S so far; H, O, R are absent)

We still need 3 more letters. A good strategy is to keep the known-to-be-present letters (A, C, S) and add two new consonants that haven’t been tested yet, placing the known letters in allowed positions.

One systematic way is to lock E in slot 5 and place:

- S in slot 1 (allowed because S is only forbidden in slot 4)
- A in slot 2 (allowed because A is forbidden only in 1 and 3)
- C somewhere not 1 (let’s try slot 3)
- add two new consonants in slot 4 and (for slot 1 we already used S)… wait slot 1 is S.

So a candidate that satisfies all constraints is S A C _ E.

We need a consonant for slot 4 that hasn’t been ruled out and must be a valid word. A good choice is “SACKE” but that isn’t a common word; “SACKE” might not be valid. A valid word is “SAICE” (a type of groom in India), but it’s obscure.

Another good pattern: place C in slot 2 (allowed), place A in slot 4 (allowed). Then word shape becomes _ C _ A E.

We still need S somewhere. Slot 3 would be fine. So _ C S A E → “SCSAE” is not a word. Let’s reverse the positions.

Try placing S in slot 2 (allowed), A in slot 4 (allowed), C in slot 1 (allowed because C is only forbidden in slot 1 in CHASE, but feedback was C(-) so C is in word but not in position 1 — wait the feedback for C in CHASE was C(-) which means C is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So C must appear somewhere but not pos 1. So we must use C in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s draft a grid:

Slot 5: E (fixed)

We know letters: A, C, S must each appear once, not in their forbidden spots.

Forbidden positions:
- A: not 1, not 3
- C: not 1
- S: not 4

We need three letters among positions 1-4, and two more unknown consonants (or vowels) from remaining letters.

Let’s try to construct:

Option 1: S in 1, A in 2, C in 3 → S A C _ E → need a letter for slot 4. Valid word: “SACKE” is unusual. “Sauce” is 5 letters but uses U. Let’s try “SAUCE”: but we haven’t tested U yet and C is already constrained to be in word (must be used once). “SAUCE” would have C in pos 3 (allowed), A in pos 2 (allowed), S in pos 1 (allowed), E in pos 5 ✓. U is new.

That satisfies all constraints.

But we have to make sure letters not used yet we can test. “SAUCE” uses new letter U. That’s good.

Let me check constraints for “SAUCE”:

- Ends with E: ✓
- Contains A (pos 2) — allowed (not 1 or 3) ✓
- Contains C (pos 3) — allowed (not 1) ✓
- Contains S (pos 1) — allowed (not 4) ✓
- Does not use any of R, O, H ✓
- Uses new letter U.

So “SAUCE” is a valid next guess.
