For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll create a word using some of these letters. A good starting word should have distinct, common letters to help identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are very common in English
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) which are crucial for word construction
- It includes common consonants (R, S)

This should provide maximum information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A appears but is not in the first position (−)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

Since we already know those four letters are absent, we should avoid them entirely and use fresh, still-common letters. Good remaining consonant candidates: T, N, L, C, D, P, M. Good vowels left: I, U (plus A, which we know is present elsewhere).

A common structure is _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _, etc. To maximize information, pick a word with high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet. A classic follow-up word under these constraints is “ADIEU”, but that contains E which we know is absent. A better choice is “UNTIL” (but that has an E in cognate forms… wait, no, it’s U N T I L). However, that does not contain A. We need a word that definitely includes A.

A strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- Letters: P, L, A, N, T. None of them are R, O, S, E.
- Contains A in the third position—different from the first position in AROSE, so if A shows up in a different position, we’d get new info.

Another very common word is “TALON”, which also uses fresh letters and places A in position 2.

Between these, “TALON” seems slightly more informative because the A moves to position 2, and the remaining letters T, L, N are all new and common.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x-feedback):  
   R, O, S, E, T, N, C, M

2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word:  
   L (position 2) and A (position 3) both marked ✓.

3. From C L A M P:  
   - C and M are not in the word.  
   - P is marked “-” → P is somewhere in the word but **not** in position 5.  

So the secret word looks like:  
_ L A _ _ with P somewhere in positions 1, 4 (since P≠5).

Available letters not yet eliminated:  
B D F G H I J K U V W Y (and of course L, A, P are already placed or guaranteed).

We need a 5-letter word that
- keeps L in position 2 and A in position 3,  
- uses P in position 1 or 4,  
- uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Two promising templates:
- P L A _ _  (P in 1)  
- _ L A P _  (P in 4, gap 1 can be any allowed letter)

Let’s pick “PLACK” (a real word meaning “a spot or patch”).  
- Letters: P, L, A, C, K – but C is already ruled out (x in CLAMP).  
So discard PLACK.

Next try: “PLAID” – D is allowed, but I is allowed.  
- P L A I D: letters P, L, A, I, D.  
  - L and A positions match.  
  - P in position 1 tests P at front.  
  - I and D are new untested letters.  

This seems optimal.

Other possibilities: “FLANK” – but N is disallowed.  
“GLAZY” – z is rare and not in remaining pool.  
“PLAGU” – not a valid word.  

Thus “PLAID” is the best candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word should have distinct, common letters to help identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are very common in English
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) which are crucial for word construction
- It includes common consonants (R, S)

This should provide maximum information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A appears but is not in the first position (−)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

Since we already know those four letters are absent, we should avoid them entirely and use fresh, still-common letters. Good remaining consonant candidates: T, N, L, C, D, P, M. Good vowels left: I, U (plus A, which we know is present elsewhere).

A common structure is _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _, etc. To maximize information, pick a word with high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet. A classic follow-up word under these constraints is “ADIEU”, but that contains E which we know is absent. A better choice is “UNTIL” (but that has an E in cognate forms… wait, no, it’s U N T I L). However, that does not contain A. We need a word that definitely includes A.

A strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- Letters: P, L, A, N, T. None of them are R, O, S, E.
- Contains A in the third position—different from the first position in AROSE, so if A shows up in a different position, we’d get new info.

Another very common word is “TALON”, which also uses fresh letters and places A in position 2.

Between these, “TALON” seems slightly more informative because the A moves to position 2, and the remaining letters T, L, N are all new and common.

Let’s go with TALON.

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, N

  – A (not first or second)  
  – L (not third)

Remaining common unused letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and L, avoids the six forbidden letters, and places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 2, and L somewhere other than position 3.

Good candidate patterns: A _ _ _ L, _ A _ L _, _ _ A _ L, _ _ _ A L, etc.

One strong word meeting all constraints is “CLAMP”:
- Letters: C, L, A, M, P – none of R,O,S,E,T,N.  
- A is in position 3 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (allowed).  

It also introduces four new letters (C, M, P) to test.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll create a word using some of these letters. A good starting word should have distinct, common letters to help identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are very common in English
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) which are crucial for word construction
- It includes common consonants (R, S)

This should provide maximum information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A appears but is not in the first position (−)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. Does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

Since we already know those four letters are absent, we should avoid them entirely and use fresh, still-common letters. Good remaining consonant candidates: T, N, L, C, D, P, M. Good vowels left: I, U (plus A, which we know is present elsewhere).

A common structure is _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _, etc. To maximize information, pick a word with high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet. A classic follow-up word under these constraints is “ADIEU”, but that contains E which we know is absent. A better choice is “UNTIL” (but that has an E in cognate forms… wait, no, it’s U N T I L). However, that does not contain A. We need a word that definitely includes A.

A strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- Letters: P, L, A, N, T. None of them are R, O, S, E.
- Contains A in the third position—different from the first position in AROSE, so if A shows up in a different position, we’d get new info.

Another very common word is “TALON”, which also uses fresh letters and places A in position 2.

Between these, “TALON” seems slightly more informative because the A moves to position 2, and the remaining letters T, L, N are all new and common.

Let’s go with TALON.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TALON -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(-) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word, but in wrong positions so far:  
  – A (not first or second)  
  – L (not third)

Remaining common unused letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and L, avoids the six forbidden letters, and places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 2, and L somewhere other than position 3.

Good candidate patterns: A _ _ _ L, _ A _ L _, _ _ A _ L, _ _ _ A L, etc.

One strong word meeting all constraints is “CLAMP”:
- Letters: C, L, A, M, P – none of R,O,S,E,T,N.  
- A is in position 3 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (allowed).  

It also introduces four new letters (C, M, P) to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

Guess 3: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x-feedback):  
   R, O, S, E, T, N, C, M

2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word:  
   L (position 2) and A (position 3) both marked ✓.

3. From C L A M P:  
   - C and M are not in the word.  
   - P is marked “-” → P is somewhere in the word but **not** in position 5.  

So the secret word looks like:  
_ L A _ _ with P somewhere in positions 1, 4 (since P≠5).

Available letters not yet eliminated:  
B D F G H I J K U V W Y (and of course L, A, P are already placed or guaranteed).

We need a 5-letter word that
- keeps L in position 2 and A in position 3,  
- uses P in position 1 or 4,  
- uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Two promising templates:
- P L A _ _  (P in 1)  
- _ L A P _  (P in 4, gap 1 can be any allowed letter)

Let’s pick “PLACK” (a real word meaning “a spot or patch”).  
- Letters: P, L, A, C, K – but C is already ruled out (x in CLAMP).  
So discard PLACK.

Next try: “PLAID” – D is allowed, but I is allowed.  
- P L A I D: letters P, L, A, I, D.  
  - L and A positions match.  
  - P in position 1 tests P at front.  
  - I and D are new untested letters.  

This seems optimal.

Other possibilities: “FLANK” – but N is disallowed.  
“GLAZY” – z is rare and not in remaining pool.  
“PLAGU” – not a valid word.  

Thus “PLAID” is the best candidate.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state:
- Positions locked: P(1), L(2), A(3) – all ✓.
- Letters known NOT in the word (x-feedback):
  R, O, S, E, T, N, C, M, I, D
- Remaining unused letters that still might appear:
  B, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y

So the word structure must be:
P L A _ _

The only two positions still unknown are positions 4 and 5, both must be chosen from the remaining letters and must not be any of the already excluded ones.

Scanning the remaining letters for common English endings, we have:
- B, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y

Obvious 5-letter words that fit P L A _ _ and use only those letters:
- PLUCK  (letters: P,L,A,U,C,K) – but C is already ruled out.
- PLUMY  – but M is ruled out.
- PLAUS  – S is ruled out.
- PLUGS  – S is ruled out, G is allowed.
- PLUGS – still has S.
- PLUMY – M is ruled out.

Actually, the only valid candidates that use allowed letters:
- PLUMB (B) – B is allowed.
- PLUGH (H) – a real word (British variant spelling “plough” or mining term).
- PLUGS – S ruled out.
- PLUMY – M ruled out.
- PLUNK (K) – N is ruled out.

So the only valid English words left are:
- PLUMB
- PLUGH

Among these, PLUMB is much more common and uses B (a remaining allowed letter).

Therefore, the next logical guess is PLUMB.
