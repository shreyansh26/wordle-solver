Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain to narrow down possibilities. The best starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

A strong strategy is to use words with:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular optimal starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers all vowels but lacks consonants)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's well-balanced with three consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), all of which are very common in English words.

- L(x): No L in the word.

- E(✓): E is in position 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

A strong strategy is to use words with:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular optimal starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers all vowels but lacks consonants)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's well-balanced with three consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E), all of which are very common in English words.

- E(✓): E is in position 5.

So we know the pattern: S _ A _ E  
Letters to avoid: L, T  
Letters to keep: S, A, E in their exact positions.

Possible next step: pick a word that fits S _ A _ E and introduces new common consonants to test. Good candidates are:
- SHADE (H, D)
- SPACE (P, C)
- STARE (but T is excluded)
- SHAVE (H, V)

We have the fixed pattern S H A _ E and the following letters already ruled out for position 4: L, T, P, C, R, M, K.

Remaining consonants not yet tried for position 4: D, N, G, B, F, V, etc.

Common 5-letter English words following S H A _ E:
- SHADE (D)
- SHAVE (V)
- SHANE (N)

Among these, SHADE is very common, and D has not been tested yet. Since we have only one try left, we should choose the statistically most likely letter for position 4, which is D.

Therefore, the secret word is most likely SHADE.
