For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information by covering a broad set of common letters. The best first guesses are typically those that include the most frequently used letters in English. Some top choices include:

- SLATE: Covers common letters S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: Covers C, R, A, N, E
- CRISP: Covers C, R, I, S, P
- CRATE: Covers C, R, A, T, E

Looking at these, SLATE seems like a strong choice because it includes:
1. S - very common starting letter
2. L - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. T - very common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
- A is correct in position 3 (S _ A _ _)
- E is correct in position 5 (S _ A _ E)
- L and T are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. The third letter is A
3. The fifth letter is E
4. Letters definitely not in the word: L, T

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters we haven't tried yet. Good candidates for these positions include common consonants and vowels like R, N, C, M, P, D, B, I, O, U, etc.

Looking for common patterns that fit S _ A _ E:
- SHARE (S H A R E) - but R wasn't tested yet
- STARE - but T is already excluded
- SPACE - P and C haven't been used
- SNAKE - N and K haven't been used
- SHAPE - H, P haven't been used
- SABLE - B and L (but L is excluded)

Between these, SHARE seems strong as it tests H and R which are common letters we haven't tried yet, and fits the known pattern perfectly.

Alternative good choices might be SPARE or SHADE, but SHARE tests the most new common letters efficiently.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

The best first guesses are typically those that include the most frequently used letters in English. Some top choices include:

- SLATE: Covers common letters S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: Covers C, R, A, N, E
- CRISP: Covers C, R, I, S, P
- CRATE: Covers C, R, A, T, E

Looking at these, SLATE seems like a strong choice because it includes:
1. S - very common starting letter
2. L - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. T - very common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. The third letter is A
3. The fifth letter is E
4. Letters definitely not in the word: L, T

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters we haven't tried yet. Good candidates for these positions include common consonants and vowels like R, N, C, M, P, D, B, I, O, U, etc.

Looking for common patterns that fit S _ A _ E:
- SHARE (S H A R E) - but R wasn't tested yet
- STARE - but T is already excluded
- SPACE - P and C haven't been used
- SNAKE - N and K haven't been used
- SHAPE - H, P haven't been used
- SABLE - B and L (but L is excluded)

Between these, SHARE seems strong as it tests H and R which are common letters we haven't tried yet, and fits the known pattern perfectly.

Alternative good choices might be SPARE or SHADE, but SHARE tests the most new common letters efficiently.
