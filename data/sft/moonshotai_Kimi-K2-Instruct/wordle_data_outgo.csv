For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify key vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, D, M, etc.

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to see which letters might be in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it appeared in position 3).

Since we now know O is somewhere in the word (but not position 3), we want to place O in a different spot and avoid all the letters that were marked “x”.  
Letters we can’t use: A, R, S, E.  
Letters still in play: O, plus any other unused letters.

Good next-step words with O and no banned letters:
- DOUGH (but G wasn’t tested yet)
- COULD (but L and D weren’t tested yet)
- JOULE (but J, U, L, E are unused/uncertain)
- POINT (but N, T, I are fresh)
- MOUNT (but M, U, N, T are new)

I’ll pick a word that keeps O in a new position and introduces some of the most common remaining consonants (T, N, L, etc.).

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Forbidden letters (x): A, R, S, E, P, I, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word but not in their previous positions:
   - O: must be in the word, but cannot be in position 2 or 3.
   - T: must be in the word, but cannot be in position 5.

So the hidden word contains both O and T, and possibly other letters that have not been ruled out yet.  
Remaining alphabet letters (not ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and T
- Uses none of the forbidden letters
- Places O somewhere other than positions 2 or 3
- Places T somewhere other than position 5

Possible candidates:  
- MOTTO – but O is in positions 2 & 4; one O must be in 2 (forbidden) → reject.  
- GLOOT – uses O twice and T; O is in 2 & 3 (both forbidden) – reject.  
- COUTH – uses O in 3 (forbidden) – reject.  
- JOTTY – O in 2 (forbidden) – reject.  
- MOTEL – E forbidden – reject.

- TOTEM – has E forbidden – reject.  
- GROUT – O in 3 (forbidden) – reject.  
- COMFY – has no T – reject.

Let me instead construct a word with:
- O in position 1 or 4 (both are allowed).
- T in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate:

Another candidate:  
- JOTUN – has N (forbidden) – reject.

Another:

- CUBOT – O in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.  
- FUMOT – T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.  
- LUMOT – T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.

Try O in position 1:

- OUGHT – has G, H, T; O in 1 (allowed), T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.

- Only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate:  
- GOTCH – G, O, T, C, H – all allowed; O is in position 2 (still forbidden) – reject.

Another candidate:  
- JOTUN – has N (forbidden) – reject.

Another:  
- COBUT – C, O, B, U, T – all allowed so far; O is in 2 (forbidden) – reject.

Try O in position 4:  
- CUBOT – O in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.  
- FUMOT – T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.  
- LUMOT – T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.

Try O in position 1:  
- OPTIC – has I and P (both forbidden) – reject.  
- OUGHT – has G, H, T; O in 1 (allowed), T in 5 (forbidden) – reject.  
- OCTET – has C, T, E (E forbidden) – reject.  
- OUTDO – has D, O; T in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed) – but has U (allowed). All letters are allowed, and no forbidden letters.  
  Positions check:  
  - O: position 1 – allowed (was positions 2 & 3 in earlier guesses).  
  - T: position 4 – allowed (was position 5 in POINT).  
  Letters used: O, U, T, D; all are allowed. So OUTDO looks valid.

Let’s confirm no forbidden letters:  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N – none appear in OUTDO. Good.

Current knowledge:
- Word length 5.
- Letters we know are IN the word (and in correct positions):
  – O is in position 1 (✓).
  – U is in position 2 (✓).
  – T is in position 3 (✓).
- Letters we know are NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, E, P, I, N, D.
- We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen only from the remaining alphabet (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We must pick a word that:
  – Starts with OUT.
  – Uses only allowed letters.
  – Forms a valid English word.

Candidate endings:
- OUT__ → OUTGO (O already used in position 1, second O allowed? English words can repeat letters.)
- OUTBY
- OUTLY  (not valid)
- OUTFY  (not valid)
- OUTGO is the only common word fitting the pattern.

Check letters in OUTGO:
- O, U, T, G, O  
All letters are allowed (G is not on the forbidden list), and positions 4 and 5 must be filled; G and the second O are both allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is OUTGO.
