For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters in English 5-letter words. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Common vowels: E, A, O, I, U
- Common consonants: T, N, S, R, L, D, H, C, M, P

A good first guess should contain:
1. Common vowels (especially E and A)
2. Common consonants (especially T, N, S, R)

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A and E (the two most common vowels)
- T (very common consonant)

Other good options would be ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers many of the most common letters.

We now know the secret word has:
- T in the 4th position.  
- No S, L, A, or E anywhere in the word.  

That leaves us with consonants and vowels we have not ruled out.  We still have:
- Vowels left to test: I, O, U  
- Consonants left to test (common ones): R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Preserve the confirmed T in position 4.  
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible that haven’t been ruled out.  
3. Avoid repeating S, L, A, E.  

A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F and R are new common consonants.  
- O is a common vowel.

Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

1. Word must be 5 letters.
2. T is in position 4 (fixed).
3. O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2 and NOT in position 3.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, F, R, N, U, B.
5. Letters confirmed to be present and their positions:
   - D in position 1.
   - T in position 4.
   - O somewhere among positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 4).

So the pattern must be:  
D _ _ T _  
and the remaining letters must include O in either position 3 or 5.

We have two remaining slots (positions 2 and either 3 or 5) to fill with allowed letters.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
C, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
(We can use these plus O.)

Possible structures:
- If O is in position 3: D _ O T _  → then position 2 and 5 must be filled with allowed letters.
- If O is in position 5: D _ _ T O  → then position 2 and 3 must be filled with allowed letters.

Let’s list common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

1. D _ O T _  
   - DOTTY (but Y allowed, T already used in 4, but T can repeat although unlikely)  
   - DITTO (I and T again) – not ideal.

2. D _ _ T O  
   - DITTO (again)  
   - “DITTO” uses I and then T twice – but T is already in position 4; repeating T would only make sense if T appeared twice in the word, which seems less likely.  
   - “DUSTO” – U is ruled out.  
   - “DIGHT” – H and G allowed, but no O.  

Another approach: position 2 and 3 must be from remaining consonants or I.

Let’s try D I _ T O.  
Need a consonant in position 3.  
D I C T O – “DICTO” is not a valid English word.  
D I P T O – “DIPTO” is invalid.  
D I G T O – “DIGTO” is invalid.  

D _ O T _  
D I O T _  
Need a consonant in position 5.  
D I O T Y – “DIOTY” is invalid.  

Let me think of common 5-letter words ending in TO or with O in position 3.

“MOTOR” – ruled out due to O in position 2 and R.  
“DITTO” – most plausible, even if T repeats.  

Let’s check “DITTO”:
- D ✓, I, T (position 3), T (position 4), O (position 5).  
- Feedback would show:  
  D ✓, I -, T x (since T is in position 4, not 3), T ✓, O ✓.  
  So T in position 3 would be x (wrong position), which is acceptable.  

But is “DITTO” valid? Yes, it’s a common word meaning the same or a duplicate mark.

However, we have O that must be somewhere, and in “DITTO” it’s in position 5, which satisfies O not in position 2 or 3.  
Also, I is a new letter to test.

Thus, “DITTO” seems to be the only plausible word left under these constraints.

Let me confirm:
- D _ _ T O  
- D I T T O – but T is already in position 4, so T in position 3 would be flagged as wrong position – which is acceptable.  

Thus, the next guess should be “DITTO”.
