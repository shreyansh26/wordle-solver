For the first guess, it's strategically best to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Classic starting words include choices like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This should give good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,STUMP,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategically best to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Classic starting words include choices like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This should give good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback from RAISE:
- R, A, I, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). That means S appears somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

So far we know:
1. Must contain S (but not in position 4).
2. Must NOT contain R, A, I, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, F, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A, I, E are out).

A good second guess should:
- Use S in a new position (e.g., position 1 or 2)
- Introduce common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, O, U, N, L, etc.
- Form a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- Uses O and U (remaining vowels).
- Uses N and D (common consonants).

- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- Letters that have been eliminated from the word: R, A, I, E, O, N, D.  
- Letters that are still unknown / untested: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, plus the two remaining vowels (but only U remains as a vowel candidate since A, I, E, O are gone).

Step 2 – Plan the next guess  
- Lock S in position 1.  
- Place U somewhere other than position 3.  
- Introduce as many new common consonants as possible.  
- Form a valid 5-letter word.

Step 3 – Candidate words  
Possible consonants left: T, L, C, K, P, H, M, etc.  
Try to use two or three of them plus U.

Examples:  
- S U L K Y  (U in position 2)  
- S P U M Y  (U in position 3 – but we know U can’t be in 3)  
- S L U M P  (U in position 3 – invalid)  
- S H U C K  (U in position 3 – invalid)  
- S T U M P  (U in position 3 – invalid)  
- S L U T H  (U in position 3 – invalid)  
- S U L P H  – not a real word  
- S U B L Y – not a real word  
- S U L K Y – valid, uses L, K, Y (new letters) and U in position 2.

“SULKY” meets all constraints:
- S is correctly at position 1.  
- U is not in position 3.  
- All other letters (L, K, Y) are new and untested.

Step 1 – Parse the new feedback for SHTUM  
- S(✓) – confirmed in position 1.  
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.  
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- M(-) – M is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Step 2 – Consolidate everything we now know  
Letters fixed: S _ _ _ _  
Excluded letters (x feedback somewhere): R, A, I, E, O, N, D, L, K, Y, H.  
Letters confirmed in the word (but not fixed in position yet): T, U, M.  

Mandatory inclusion: S, T, U, M.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and contains T, U, M somewhere in positions 2-5, obeying:
- T ≠ 3  
- U ≠ 3 and U ≠ 4  
- M ≠ 5  

Step 3 – Determine possible positions  
Allowed positions for each required letter:
- T: 2, 4, 5  
- U: 2, 5 (since 3 & 4 are excluded)  
- M: 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is excluded)

Step 4 – Construct the only remaining valid pattern  
Because we have four required letters (S, T, U, M) in five slots, one of them must be repeated or we must fit them exactly.  
Since we only have 5 slots and 4 distinct required letters, the unique possibility is:
Slot 1: S  
Slots 2-5: T, U, M plus one other allowed letter (from remaining: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

But the word still has to be a valid 5-letter English word.  
Let’s list the only plausible placement meeting the constraints:

- T must be in 2, 4, or 5  
- U must be in 2 or 5  
- M must be in 2, 3, or 4  

Quick enumeration:
1. S T U M _ – invalid (needs 5th letter)  
2. S T _ M U – positions: S(1)T(2)M(4)U(5). This satisfies:  
   • T not in 3  
   • U not in 3 or 4  
   • M not in 5  

The missing letter in the blank (position 3) must be an allowed consonant.  
The only common English word that fits S T _ M U is “STUMU” – but that’s not a word.  
Next check:  
- “STUM P” – but P isn’t tested yet, but it’s a complete word: “STUMP”  
  – Letters: S(✓), T, U, M, P  
  – All constrained positions obeyed (T in 2, U in 5, M in 4).  
  – P has not been ruled out (never appeared before).  
  – STUMP is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, STUMP is the only remaining candidate that satisfies every constraint.

<guess>STUMP</guess>",STUMP,"Step 1 – Parse the new feedback for SHTUM  
- S(✓) – confirmed in position 1.  
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.  
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- M(-) – M is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Step 2 – Consolidate everything we now know  
Letters fixed: S _ _ _ _  
Excluded letters (x feedback somewhere): R, A, I, E, O, N, D, L, K, Y, H.  
Letters confirmed in the word (but not fixed in position yet): T, U, M.  

Mandatory inclusion: S, T, U, M.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and contains T, U, M somewhere in positions 2-5, obeying:
- T ≠ 3  
- U ≠ 3 and U ≠ 4  
- M ≠ 5  

Step 3 – Determine possible positions  
Allowed positions for each required letter:
- T: 2, 4, 5  
- U: 2, 5 (since 3 & 4 are excluded)  
- M: 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is excluded)

Step 4 – Construct the only remaining valid pattern  
Because we have four required letters (S, T, U, M) in five slots, one of them must be repeated or we must fit them exactly.  
Since we only have 5 slots and 4 distinct required letters, the unique possibility is:
Slot 1: S  
Slots 2-5: T, U, M plus one other allowed letter (from remaining: B, C, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

But the word still has to be a valid 5-letter English word.  
Let’s list the only plausible placement meeting the constraints:

- T must be in 2, 4, or 5  
- U must be in 2 or 5  
- M must be in 2, 3, or 4  

Quick enumeration:
1. S T U M _ – invalid (needs 5th letter)  
2. S T _ M U – positions: S(1)T(2)M(4)U(5). This satisfies:  
   • T not in 3  
   • U not in 3 or 4  
   • M not in 5  

The missing letter in the blank (position 3) must be an allowed consonant.  
The only common English word that fits S T _ M U is “STUMU” – but that’s not a word.  
Next check:  
- “STUM P” – but P isn’t tested yet, but it’s a complete word: “STUMP”  
  – Letters: S(✓), T, U, M, P  
  – All constrained positions obeyed (T in 2, U in 5, M in 4).  
  – P has not been ruled out (never appeared before).  
  – STUMP is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, STUMP is the only remaining candidate that satisfies every constraint.",Guess 5: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) U(✓) M(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
