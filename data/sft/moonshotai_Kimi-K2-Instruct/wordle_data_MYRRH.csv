For the first guess in Wordle, it's generally best to choose a word that includes common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they cover frequently used letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This should give good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.

- M is in the word but not in spot 4.

Forbidden letters (x):  
S, L, A, T, E, O, U, N, D, C, I, P

Still-allowed letters:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R and M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and M.
2. Does NOT place R in 1st or 2nd position.
3. Does NOT place M in 4th position.
4. Uses only the allowed letters above.

A quick scan of common English words meeting these constraints:
- HUMPY (but P is banned)
- FURRY (but U is banned)
- FJORD (but O, D, J are questionable or banned)
- BROOM (O, O banned)
- MERGE (E, G, E banned)
- MORPH (O, P, H banned)
- MURKY (U, K, Y)
- MURRY (U, Y)

The best remaining candidate that fits all rules: MURKY  
- Contains M and R.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- All letters (M, U, R, K, Y) must still be checked for inclusion, but note we already know R and M are in the word; the rest are new tests.

Actually, U was ruled out in ROUND feedback, so MURKY is invalid.

Let’s re-scan with no U, O, etc.:

Valid letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, R, M.

Must have R and M.

Possible words:
- BUMPY (P banned)
- GUMMY (U, Y banned)
- JUMPY (U, P banned)
- MURKY (U banned)
- MARRY (A banned)
- BERRY (B, E, R, R, Y) – but E banned
- FERRY (E banned)
- HARRY (A banned)
- HORNY (O banned)
- KURKY (K, U, R, K, Y) – but U banned
- MURRA (A banned)
- WORRY (O banned)

All the obvious common words get pruned because they use banned vowels.  
Let’s try a less common but valid word: MRKVY – but this isn’t a recognized English word.

Next best valid English word: MYRRH  
- Contains M and R.
- R appears twice, positions 3 and 4 (allowed for R).
- All letters (M, Y, R, R, H) are allowed (none in banned list).
- It’s a recognized English word.

This seems the strongest remaining guess.

- HUMPY (but P is banned)
- FURRY (but U is banned)
- FJORD (but O, D, J are questionable or banned)
- BROOM (O, O banned)
- MERGE (E, G, E banned)
- MORPH (O, P, H banned)
- MURKY (U, K, Y)
- MURRY (U, Y)

The best remaining candidate that fits all rules: MURKY  
- Contains M and R.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- M is in position 1 (allowed).
- All letters (M, U, R, K, Y) must still be checked for inclusion, but note we already know R and M are in the word; the rest are new tests.

Actually, U was ruled out in ROUND feedback, so MURKY is invalid.

Let’s re-scan with no U, O, etc.:

Valid letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, R, M.

Must have R and M.

Possible words:
- BUMPY (P banned)
- GUMMY (U, Y banned)
- JUMPY (U, P banned)
- MURKY (U banned)
- MARRY (A banned)
- BERRY (B, E, R, R, Y) – but E banned
- FERRY (E banned)
- HARRY (A banned)
- HORNY (O banned)
- KURKY (K, U, R, K, Y) – but U banned
- MURRA (A banned)
- WORRY (O banned)

All the obvious common words get pruned because they use banned vowels.  
Let’s try a less common but valid word: MRKVY – but this isn’t a recognized English word.

Next best valid English word: MYRRH  
- Contains M and R.
- R appears twice, positions 3 and 4 (allowed for R).
- All letters (M, Y, R, R, H) are allowed (none in banned list).
- It’s a recognized English word.

This seems the strongest remaining guess.",Guess 4: MYRRH -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) Y(✓) R(✓) R(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
