- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starter word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

One of the most effective first-guess words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This combination gives us good coverage for identifying letters that are in or out of the word.

Other good first-guess options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is slightly better due to its vowel coverage.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.  
- S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- E is in the word and is in position 5.  

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.  
2. S appears somewhere in the first four letters (positions 1-4).  
3. None of A, R, O appear anywhere.  

Next, we should pick a word that:
- Keeps S and E in positions we now believe are possible.  
- Introduces new common consonants (D, T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U).  
- Avoids A, R, O.  

A strong candidate is “UNTIE” because it uses U, N, T, I, E.  
- E is already confirmed at position 5 – matches.  
- S is not in this word, so we’ll lose that information; instead we should include S in a different position.  

Better: “STILE”
- Ends in E, keeps S but moves it to position 1.  
- Adds T, I, L — all new letters not yet tested.  
- Avoids A, R, O.  

Another option: “SLIME”
- Ends in E, keeps S at position 1, adds L, I, M.  
Still valid and adds M.  

I’ll go with “STILE” for its good coverage of new consonants and vowels while respecting known constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
- A(x), R(x), O(x) → these three letters are completely out.  
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

- S(✓) → S is now in the correct position (position 1).  
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.  
- I(✓) → I is in the correct position (position 3).  
- L(✓) → L is in the correct position (position 4).  
- E(✓) → E is already confirmed at position 5.

So we already have:
- Position 1: S  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: L  
- Position 5: E  

The only remaining unknown is position 2.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, T.  
Allowed letters for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Among these, common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W.  
Choosing a common consonant that hasn’t been tested yet: N is very frequent and hasn’t appeared.

Therefore the word must be S _ I L E with N in position 2 → “SNILE” is not a valid English word.  
Next common choice: “SMILE” is valid and fits perfectly.

Check constraints:
- SMILE:  
  S (✓ pos 1), M (new), I (✓ pos 3), L (✓ pos 4), E (✓ pos 5)  
  No A, R, O, T.  
  All positions satisfy current clues.  

Hence, the logical next guess is “SMILE”.
