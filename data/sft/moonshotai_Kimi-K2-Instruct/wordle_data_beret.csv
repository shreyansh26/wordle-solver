For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. I'll choose a word that combines several of these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeated letters.

The feedback from “AROSE” tells us:

- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Therefore the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R somewhere except position 2.
2. Uses E somewhere except position 5.
3. Avoids A, O, S.

I’ll pick a word that keeps R and E while trying fresh, common consonants and vowels. “RETRY” is tempting, but repeats R and E too much. “BERET” looks good: it has R (in position 3), E (in position 2), and introduces B and T, which are common and unused so far.

Check positions:
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- No A, O, or S.
- Valid 5-letter word.

So I’ll go with “BERET”.
