For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, as this will test more unique letters. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This combination should give me good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in English words.

The feedback shows:
- R is in the word but in the WRONG position (not first).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letter R somewhere other than position 1.
- Contain none of A, I, S, E.

That leaves us with a very limited set of possible consonants. We still need to test other vowels (O, U) and common consonants that were not used (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good next guess should introduce new high-frequency letters that haven’t been eliminated yet. Since R must be in positions 2-5, I’ll choose a word that places R in a new spot and tests other common consonants and vowels. ""ROUND"" is a strong candidate because it introduces O and U (untested vowels), plus N and D (common consonants), while moving R to the second position. This will give us new information about the remaining letters.

From the combined feedback:

- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
- O is in the word and already in the correct (second) position.  
- U and D are NOT in the word.  
- N is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word has the pattern:

 _  O  _  _  _

and must contain R and N (but not in the spots already ruled out).

Letters still definitely excluded: A, I, S, E, U, D.

That leaves us with a limited alphabet to work with. We still need to test other common letters like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

We know:
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- N must appear somewhere other than position 5 (so positions 3 or 4).

Let’s try the word “FRONT”.

- F is an untested consonant.
- R is placed in position 3 (a new spot).
- O is already locked in position 2.
- N is placed in position 4 (a new spot).
- T is an untested consonant.

This arrangement satisfies all current constraints and tests two new consonants (F and T) while correctly positioning O and testing new positions for R and N.

Let's consolidate what we now know from every clue so far.

1. R must appear in the secret word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
   ⇒ R can only be in position 4 or 5.

2. O must appear and is ALREADY in the correct spot: position 2 (✓).

3. N must appear and is ALREADY in the correct spot: position 4 (✓).

4. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T.

Therefore the secret word has the fixed pattern:

_  O  _  N  _

and must include R somewhere.  
Since R can only be in position 4 or 5, and position 4 is already N, R MUST be in position 5.

Hence the pattern is:

_  O  _  N  R

The only remaining unknown letter is position 3.  
Allowed consonants now are among: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y…  
Among these, common letters likely to appear are B, C, G, L, M, P.

Testing the common ones, the word “HONOR” fits but has an A (already excluded).  
“CONGR” is not a word.  
“GONER” has E (excluded).  
“BONER” has E (excluded).  
“PONER” – no, same problem.  
“LONER” has E (excluded).  
“CONER” – not a valid word.  
“BONGR” – invalid.  
“BONOR” – invalid.

Wait: the only remaining vowel we haven’t excluded is Y sometimes acting as a vowel.  
But we have a solid consonant possibility: C, G, L, M, etc.

Let’s pick “CORN” plus one letter – we need five letters.  
Actually the pattern is _ O _ N R, so possible words:

- C O _ N R → CO_ NR
- M O _ N R → MO_ NR
- G O _ N R → GO_ NR
- K O _ N R → KO_ NR
- L O _ N R → LO_ NR

Among these, the most common valid English 5-letter word is “CORNR”? No.  
Wait: “CORNY” is invalid (Y in 5th).  
“CONEY” has E (excluded).  
“MONEY” has E.  
“GONER” has E.  
“BONER” has E.  
“LONER” has E.  
“HONOR” has O in 2 and R in 5, but H is untested and the word is “HONOR” – valid.  
Check letters: H, O, N, O, R – second O is repeated, but duplicate O is allowed unless eliminated. The feedback only eliminated A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T – O is allowed.  
So “HONOR” is a valid candidate.

Let’s verify constraints:

- Pattern: _ O _ N R – H O N O R.  
- Contains R (position 5) ✓  
- Contains O in position 2 ✓  
- Contains N in position 4 ✓  
- No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T) appear.  
- H is new and untested.

Therefore “HONOR” is an excellent next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, as this will test more unique letters. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This combination should give me good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback shows:
- R is in the word but in the WRONG position (not first).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letter R somewhere other than position 1.
- Contain none of A, I, S, E.

That leaves us with a very limited set of possible consonants. We still need to test other vowels (O, U) and common consonants that were not used (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good next guess should introduce new high-frequency letters that haven’t been eliminated yet. Since R must be in positions 2-5, I’ll choose a word that places R in a new spot and tests other common consonants and vowels. ""ROUND"" is a strong candidate because it introduces O and U (untested vowels), plus N and D (common consonants), while moving R to the second position. This will give us new information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
- O is in the word and already in the correct (second) position.  
- U and D are NOT in the word.  
- N is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word has the pattern:

 _  O  _  _  _

and must contain R and N (but not in the spots already ruled out).

Letters still definitely excluded: A, I, S, E, U, D.

That leaves us with a limited alphabet to work with. We still need to test other common letters like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

We know:
- R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- N must appear somewhere other than position 5 (so positions 3 or 4).

Let’s try the word “FRONT”.

- F is an untested consonant.
- R is placed in position 3 (a new spot).
- O is already locked in position 2.
- N is placed in position 4 (a new spot).
- T is an untested consonant.

This arrangement satisfies all current constraints and tests two new consonants (F and T) while correctly positioning O and testing new positions for R and N.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we now know from every clue so far.

1. R must appear in the secret word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
   ⇒ R can only be in position 4 or 5.

2. O must appear and is ALREADY in the correct spot: position 2 (✓).

3. N must appear and is ALREADY in the correct spot: position 4 (✓).

4. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T.

Therefore the secret word has the fixed pattern:

_  O  _  N  _

and must include R somewhere.  
Since R can only be in position 4 or 5, and position 4 is already N, R MUST be in position 5.

Hence the pattern is:

_  O  _  N  R

The only remaining unknown letter is position 3.  
Allowed consonants now are among: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y…  
Among these, common letters likely to appear are B, C, G, L, M, P.

Testing the common ones, the word “HONOR” fits but has an A (already excluded).  
“CONGR” is not a word.  
“GONER” has E (excluded).  
“BONER” has E (excluded).  
“PONER” – no, same problem.  
“LONER” has E (excluded).  
“CONER” – not a valid word.  
“BONGR” – invalid.  
“BONOR” – invalid.

Wait: the only remaining vowel we haven’t excluded is Y sometimes acting as a vowel.  
But we have a solid consonant possibility: C, G, L, M, etc.

Let’s pick “CORN” plus one letter – we need five letters.  
Actually the pattern is _ O _ N R, so possible words:

- C O _ N R → CO_ NR
- M O _ N R → MO_ NR
- G O _ N R → GO_ NR
- K O _ N R → KO_ NR

Among these, the most common valid English 5-letter word is “CORNR”? No.  
Wait: “CORNY” is invalid (Y in 5th).  
“CONEY” has E (excluded).  
“MONEY” has E.  
“GONER” has E.  
“BONER” has E.  
“LONER” has E.  
“HONOR” has O in 2 and R in 5, but H is untested and the word is “HONOR” – valid.  
Check letters: H, O, N, O, R – second O is repeated, but duplicate O is allowed unless eliminated. The feedback only eliminated A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T – O is allowed.  
So “HONOR” is a valid candidate.

Let’s verify constraints:

- Pattern: _ O _ N R – H O N O R.  
- Contains R (position 5) ✓  
- Contains O in position 2 ✓  
- Contains N in position 4 ✓  
- No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T) appear.

Let's decode the new feedback:

1. H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
3. N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4; it must be elsewhere).
4. The second O was marked (-), but we already know O is in position 2 (✓) from Guess 2, so the second O in position 4 is simply redundant and doesn't count.
5. R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5; it must be elsewhere).

Current constraints:
- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed: H O _ _ _
- The word must contain N and R, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Excluded letters so far: A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T.
- N cannot be in position 4, and R cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for N and R:
- N can be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is currently free, though it was marked wrong before - wait, in Guess 3, N was in position 4 and was ✓, but in Guess 4 it was (-). This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine:

Looking back at Guess 3 (FRONT): N was in position 4 and was ✓ - so N is in position 4 and correct.
But in Guess 4 (HONOR): N was in position 3 and was (-) - meaning it's in the word but not in position 3.

This indicates N is in position 4 (from Guess 3) and O is in position 2 (from Guess 2), H is in position 1 (from Guess 4).

So the pattern is: H O _ N _

The remaining letter must be R, but R cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 4 feedback where R in position 5 was (-)).

But we know R must be in the word (from Guess 1), and the only remaining position is 3.

Therefore, the word must be H O R N _.

But we need a 5-letter word ending with N, but position 4 is already N. So it would have to be H O R N ?, but that's impossible as we only have 5 letters.

Wait, this suggests our interpretation might be off. Let me re-examine Guess 4:

HONOR feedback:
H(✓) - position 1 correct
O(✓) - position 2 correct
N(-) - N is in word but not position 3
O(-) - second O is not in position 4
R(-) - R is in word but not position 5

From Guess 3 (FRONT):
R(-) - R is in word but not position 2
O(-) - O is in word but not position 3
N(✓) - N is in position 4

This creates a contradiction unless we consider that Guess 3's N(✓) means N is in position 4, and Guess 4's N(-) means it's not in position 3 - which is consistent.

So current fixed positions:
1: H
2: O
4: N

And R must be in position 3 or 5, but not 5 (from Guess 4), so position 3.

Thus the word must be H O R N ?

But we need 5 letters. The only possibility is HORN plus one more letter, but position 5 must be empty, which is impossible.

This indicates we might have made an error in interpretation. Let me re-express the feedback:

Guess 3 FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(-) N(✓) T(x)
- N is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 2
- O is in word but not position 3

Guess 4 HONOR: H(✓) O(✓) N(-) O(-) R(-)
- H is correct in position 1
- First O is correct in position 2
- N is in word but not position 3
- Second O is not in position 4 (but we already know position 2 is correct)
- R is in word but not position 5

Combining these:
- Final pattern: H O _ N R is impossible because R can't be in position 5
Wait, no - the fifth position feedback in HONOR was R(-) meaning R is in word but not position 5.

But we have:
- Position 1: H (fixed)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed from Guess 3)

R must be in position 3 or 5, but can't be in 5, so must be 3.

Thus the word is H O R N ?

But this is only 4 letters. There's clearly an inconsistency in interpretation.

Realizing the mistake: The pattern is _ _ _ _ _ (5 positions), and current constraints:
1: H
2: O
4: N
R must be in 3 or 5, but not 5 (from Guess 4), so position 3.
Thus the word is H O R N ? which is impossible as we only have 4 letters determined.

This suggests an error in earlier interpretation. Re-examining Guess 3 FRONT feedback:
F(x) R(-) O(-) N(✓) T(x) means:
- N is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 2
- O is in word but not position 3

Guess 4 HONOR feedback:
H(✓) O(✓) N(-) O(-) R(-) means:
- H is correct in position 1
- First O is correct in position 2
- N is in word but not position 3
- Second O is not in position 4
- R is in word but not position 5

So the absolute constraints are:
1: H
2: O
4: N
R must be in position 3 (since it can't be 2 or 5)
Thus the word must be H O R N ? but this is only 4 letters.

This indicates we're missing something. The only resolution is that position 5 must be filled by a letter we've not yet tested or eliminated. Looking at remaining letters not excluded (B, C, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y), and considering the pattern H O R N ?, we need a valid 5-letter word.

The word ""HORNS"" contains S (excluded), so no.
""HORNY"" contains Y (valid untested).
""HORNB"" - not a word.
""HORNG"" - not a word.

Thus the most likely word is HORNY.

Let's test HORNY:
H(✓) O(✓) R(?) N(✓) Y(?)
From constraints:
- H, O positions correct
- R must be in word - yes
- N in position 4 - yes
- Y is new letter

This seems to fit all constraints.
</think>

Given:
- H is in position 1 ✓
- O is in position 2 ✓
- N is in position 4 ✓
- R must be in position 3 (only remaining valid spot)
- The final letter must be Y to form the 5-letter word ""HORNY""

<guess>HORNY</guess>",HORNY,"Let's decode the new feedback:

1. H is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
3. N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4; it must be elsewhere).
4. The second O was marked (-), but we already know O is in position 2 (✓) from Guess 2, so the second O in position 4 is simply redundant and doesn't count.
5. R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5; it must be elsewhere).

Current constraints:
- Positions 1 and 2 are fixed: H O _ _ _
- The word must contain N and R, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Excluded letters so far: A, I, S, E, U, D, F, T.
- N cannot be in position 4, and R cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for N and R:
- N can be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is currently free, though it was marked wrong before - wait, in Guess 3, N was in position 4 and was ✓, but in Guess 4 it was (-). This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine:

Looking back at Guess 3 (FRONT): N was in position 4 and was ✓ - so N is in position 4 and correct.
But in Guess 4 (HONOR): N was in position 3 and was (-) - meaning it's in the word but not in position 3.

This indicates N is in position 4 (from Guess 3) and O is in position 2 (from Guess 2), H is in position 1 (from Guess 4).

So the pattern is: H O _ N _

The remaining letter must be R, but R cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 4 feedback where R in position 5 was (-)).

But we know R must be in the word (from Guess 1), and the only remaining position is 3.

Therefore, the word must be H O R N _.

But we need a 5-letter word ending with N, but position 4 is already N. So it would have to be H O R N ?, but that's impossible as we only have 5 letters.

Wait, this suggests our interpretation might be off. Let me re-examine Guess 4:

HONOR feedback:
H(✓) - position 1 correct
O(✓) - position 2 correct
N(-) - N is in word but not position 3
O(-) - second O is not in position 4
R(-) - R is in word but not position 5

From Guess 3 (FRONT):
R(-) - R is in word but not position 2
O(-) - O is in word but not position 3
N(✓) - N is in position 4

This creates a contradiction unless we consider that Guess 3's N(✓) means N is in position 4, and Guess 4's N(-) means it's not in position 3 - which is consistent.

So current fixed positions:
1: H
2: O
4: N

And R must be in position 3 or 5, but not 5 (from Guess 4), so position 3.

Thus the word must be H O R N ?

But we need 5 letters. The only possibility is HORN plus one more letter, but position 5 must be empty, which is impossible.

This indicates we might have made an error in interpretation. Let me re-express the feedback:

Guess 3 FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(-) N(✓) T(x)
- N is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 2
- O is in word but not position 3

Guess 4 HONOR: H(✓) O(✓) N(-) O(-) R(-)
- H is correct in position 1
- First O is correct in position 2
- N is in word but not position 3
- Second O is not in position 4 (but we already know position 2 is correct)
- R is in word but not position 5

Combining these:
- Final pattern: H O _ N R is impossible because R can't be in position 5
Wait, no - the fifth position feedback in HONOR was R(-) meaning R is in word but not position 5.

But we have:
- Position 1: H (fixed)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed from Guess 3)

R must be in position 3 or 5, but can't be in 5, so must be 3.

Thus the word is H O R N ?

But this is only 4 letters. There's clearly an inconsistency in interpretation.

Realizing the mistake: The pattern is _ _ _ _ _ (5 positions), and current constraints:
1: H
2: O
4: N
R must be in 3 or 5, but not 5 (from Guess 4), so position 3.
Thus the word is H O R N ? which is impossible as we only have 4 letters determined.

This suggests an error in earlier interpretation. Re-examining Guess 3 FRONT feedback:
F(x) R(-) O(-) N(✓) T(x) means:
- N is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 2
- O is in word but not position 3

Guess 4 HONOR feedback:
H(✓) O(✓) N(-) O(-) R(-) means:
- H is correct in position 1
- First O is correct in position 2
- N is in word but not position 3
- Second O is not in position 4
- R is in word but not position 5

So the absolute constraints are:
1: H
2: O
4: N
R must be in position 3 (since it can't be 2 or 5)
Thus the word must be H O R N ? but this is only 4 letters.

This indicates we're missing something. The only resolution is that position 5 must be filled by a letter we've not yet tested or eliminated. Looking at remaining letters not excluded (B, C, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y), and considering the pattern H O R N ?, we need a valid 5-letter word.

The word ""HORNS"" contains S (excluded), so no.
""HORNY"" contains Y (valid untested).
""HORNB"" - not a word.
""HORNG"" - not a word.

Thus the most likely word is HORNY.

Let's test HORNY:
H(✓) O(✓) R(?) N(✓) Y(?)
From constraints:
- H, O positions correct
- R must be in word - yes
- N in position 4 - yes
- Y is new letter

This seems to fit all constraints.Given:
- H is in position 1 ✓
- O is in position 2 ✓
- N is in position 4 ✓
- R must be in position 3 (only remaining valid spot)
- The final letter must be Y to form the 5-letter word ""HORNY""",Guess 5: HORNY -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
