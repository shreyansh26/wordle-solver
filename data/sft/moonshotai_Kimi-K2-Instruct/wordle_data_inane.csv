For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently occurring letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
- Good consonants to test: R, S, T, N, L
- Good vowels to test: E, A, I, O

A strong first guess should include a mix of common vowels and consonants. Words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. Uses S, L (less common but still useful)
2. Uses A, E (top vowels)
3. Uses T (very common consonant)
4. No duplicate letters

This should give good coverage across common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- CRANE is C-R-A-N-E

- BRANE (but has B which is uncommon)
- GRADE (but has T which is invalid - no, GRADE is G-R-A-D-E)
- CRANE seems good - C, R, A, N, E - none of the forbidden letters

- D + vowel: D + I, O, U → DIANE, DOANE, DUANE

- G + vowel: GIANE? GOANE? GUANE? none are words

- Confirmed letters in exact positions: A (3), N (4), E (5)

Missing letters for positions 1 and 2 must come from the remaining alphabet, excluding S, L, T, C, R.  
Remaining consonants worth trying: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

We want a valid English word that ends in “ANE” and starts with two letters that are NOT in the banned set.

Some possibilities:
- B + vowel: B I, B O, B U → BIANE? BOANE? BUANE? none are words
- D + vowel: D + I, O, U → DIANE, DOANE, DUANE  
  – DIANE is a proper name (usually capitalized), but sometimes accepted
  – DUANE is also a proper name
- G + vowel: GIANE? GOANE? GUANE? none are words
- M + vowel: M I, O, U → MIANE, MOANE, MUANE → only MOANE (variant spelling of “moan”) but obscure
- H + vowel: HIANE? HOANE? HUANE? none
- F + vowel: FIANE? FOANE? FUANE? none
- V + vowel: VIANE? VOANE? VUANE? none
- P + vowel: PIANE? POANE? PUANE? none
- K + vowel: KIANE? KOANE? KUANE? none
- W + vowel: WIANE? WOANE? WUANE? none
- Y + vowel: YIANE? YOANE? YUANE? none
- Z + vowel: ZIANE? ZOANE? ZUANE? none

Scanning a mental list of common 5-letter words ending in “ANE”:

- BRANE – eliminated (R)
- CRANE – already tried (C, R)
- DRANE – not a word
- FRANE – not a word
- GRANE – not a word
- PLANE – eliminated (L)
- PRANE – not a word
- TRANE – eliminated (T)
- DIANE – proper noun but sometimes accepted
- DUANE – proper noun
- MIANE – not a word
- MOANE – obscure variant

The only remotely plausible common-ish word left is “DIANE” (even though it is usually a name). Since we need a valid guess and nothing else obvious fits, we’ll go with DIANE.

(There are no other common English 5-letter words ending in ANE that avoid the banned letters.)

Current confirmed positions:

- Position 5: E ✓

Pattern: _ _ A N E

New information from Guess 3:
- D is not in the word at all (D(x))
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (I(-))

So:
- Position 2 cannot be I, and cannot be any letter already ruled out (S, L, T, C, R, D)
- Position 1 must be any unused letter except the banned set (S, L, T, C, R, D)

Remaining letters to consider:
- Vowels left: O, U (A, E already placed; I must appear somewhere)
- Consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But the word ends in ANE, so we only need to fill positions 1 and 2. Position 2 is NOT I (since I is misplaced), but position 1 or 2 could contain I. However, since we only have 2 letters to fill, and the word must be valid and 5 letters ending in ANE, we can list all valid English words ending in ANE and check which ones fit the constraints.

Possible valid words ending in ANE:
- BANE (B, A, N, E) – but we need 5 letters
- CANE – 4 letters
- DANE – 4 letters
- GANE – archaic, 4 letters
- JANE – 4 letters
- KANE – 4 letters
- MANE – 4 letters
- PANE – 4 letters
- SANE – 4 letters
- VANE – 4 letters
- WANE – 4 letters
- ZANE – 4 letters

Wait, these are all 4-letter words. The only common 5-letter word ending in ANE seems to be ""BLANE"" (rare) or ""SHANE"" (but S is banned), or ""PHANE"" (rare), ""GHANE"" (invalid), etc.

Upon reflection, it appears that there might not be any standard 5-letter English word that ends with ANE other than proper nouns or obscure variants. However, the feedback from DIANE suggests I must be present but not in position 2. This implies the word structure must be:

- Position 1 or 2 must contain I
- Position 2 cannot be I (from DIANE feedback)
- Therefore I must be in position 1

Thus, the word must start with I and have the pattern: I _ A N E

The only valid English word fitting this is ""INANE"" (which means silly or empty-headed).

Let's check:
- I in position 1 (not banned)
- N in position 2 (not banned - N was confirmed in position 4 in CRANE, so N can appear elsewhere)
- A in position 3 ✓
- N in position 4 ✓
- E in position 5 ✓

""INANE"" uses only permitted letters and fits the constraints perfectly.
