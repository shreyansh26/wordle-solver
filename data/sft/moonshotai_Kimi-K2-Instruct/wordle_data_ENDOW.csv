For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes the information gained. This means choosing a word with common letters and good letter distribution to quickly narrow down possibilities. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these common letters without repeating any letters. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.
- O and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).

So our next guess should:
1. Include O and E (but not in positions 3 and 5)
2. Exclude A, R, S
3. Try new common letters to maximize information

Possible positions for O and E:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Some options:
- O in position 1, E in position 2: OE...
- O in position 2, E in position 1: EO...
- O in position 4, E in position 2: .E.O.
- etc.

Looking at common letters remaining, good candidates are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, Y.

A strong choice would be ""OCEAN"" but that has A which we know is not in the word. ""OLIVE"" has I and V (V is less common). ""ONSET"" has S and T (S is excluded). ""ONION"" has N and I but repeats O and N.

""OILED"" is good - has O, E, I, L, D. But E is in position 3 which was excluded for E.

""ELBOW"" has E, L, B, O, W - good letters, positions:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)

This seems like a strong guess that tests new common letters while respecting the constraints.
