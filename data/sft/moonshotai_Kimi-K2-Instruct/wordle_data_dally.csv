For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it combines common consonants (S, L, T) with two common vowels (A, E), which should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and T and E are **not** in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 2.
- A is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters L and A somewhere, but L ≠ position 2 and A ≠ position 3.
- Does **not** contain S, T, or E.

This suggests a second guess that:
- Keeps L and A in different positions.
- Avoids S, T, E entirely.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize info.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – S, T, E are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – P, I, N are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 3 either.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 2 either.

Combining:
- Letters known so far to be in the word: L, A
- Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, P, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – L ≠ 2, 3
  – A ≠ 2, 3
- Therefore:
  – L must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – A must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – Neither can be in 2 or 3.
- Allowed letters (5-letter, valid English words, no repeats of the eliminated letters) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both L and A.
2. Places L in 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places A in 1, 4, or 5 (and A ≠ L position).
4. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
5. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Some brainstorming:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A _  or  L _ _ _ A
  – e.g., LOYAL (but Y is allowed, but second L repeats; we have no info on repeats, but it’s valid)
  – LOCAL (but C is allowed, O allowed, but A is in 4, L in 1: fits)
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L A or _ _ A _ L
  – e.g., FOUL is only 4 letters, so invalid
  – KOALA (but K is allowed, O, A, L all allowed, but A is in 3, which is forbidden) – invalid
- L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L and A in 1 or 4
  – e.g., A _ _ _ L  → AROUL (not a word)
  – _ _ A _ L → DUCAL (D, U, C, A, L all allowed; A in 3 is forbidden)
  – GLOAL (not a word)

LOCAL is a valid word:
- L at 1 (allowed), O allowed, C allowed, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed for L)
- But we already have L in word, so repeating L is okay if allowed
- However, the word must contain both L and A; LOCAL does contain both, and positions fit.

Another candidate:
CORAL – C, O, R, A, L
- L is at 5 (allowed)
- A is at 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (C, O, R not yet eliminated)
This seems better: no repeated letters, uses common remaining letters.

So my next guess is **CORAL**.

3. Places A in 1, 4, or 5 (and A ≠ L position).
4. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
5. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Some brainstorming:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A _  or  L _ _ _ A
  – e.g., LOYAL (but Y is allowed, but second L repeats; we have no info on repeats, but it’s valid)
  – LOCAL (but C is allowed, O allowed, but A is in 4, L in 1: fits)
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L A or _ _ A _ L
  – e.g., FOUL is only 4 letters, so invalid
  – KOALA (but K is allowed, O, A, L all allowed, but A is in 3, which is forbidden) – invalid
- L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L and A in 1 or 4
  – e.g., A _ _ _ L  → AROUL (not a word)
  – _ _ A _ L → DUCAL (D, U, C, A, L all allowed; A in 3 is forbidden)
  – GLOAL (not a word)

LOCAL is a valid word:
- L at 1 (allowed), O allowed, C allowed, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed for L)
- But we already have L in word, so repeating L is okay if allowed
- However, the word must contain both L and A; LOCAL does contain both, and positions fit.

Another candidate:
CORAL – C, O, R, A, L
- L is at 5 (allowed)
- A is at 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (C, O, R not yet eliminated)
This seems better: no repeated letters, uses common remaining letters.

So my next guess is **CORAL**.

Let’s list exactly what we now know.

Letters we have tried so far:  
S, L, A, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R

Feedback summary:  
- S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R are **not** in the word (all marked x).  
- L is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from L showing “-” in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 across guesses).  
  – Therefore L **must** be in position 1.  
- A is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4 (from A showing “-” in positions 2, 3, 4 across guesses).  
  – Therefore A **must** be in position 5.

So the word pattern must be:
L _ _ _ A

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated set):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three distinct letters from this set to fill positions 2, 3, 4, forming a valid 5-letter English word beginning with L and ending with A.

Possible candidates:  
- L U N A ? (length 4, invalid)  
- L U C A ? (C is eliminated)  
- L U G A ? (no standard word)  
- L U B A ? (no standard word)  
- L U N A ? (same issue)

**LUNAR** (but R is eliminated)  
**LUMMA** (invalid)  
**LUMIA** (not common)

Actually, a standard, common word is **LUNAR**, but R is eliminated.  

Let’s check again systematically:  
L _ _ _ A, letters allowed for middle three positions: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter words with pattern L _ _ _ A:

- L U M A → LUMA (4 letters)  
- L U M B A → LU**MBA** (valid)  
- L U G A N → too long

Only valid 5-letter word in standard dictionaries that fits is **LUMBA**.

Therefore, the only plausible next guess is **LUMBA**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it combines common consonants (S, L, T) with two common vowels (A, E), which should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and T and E are **not** in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 2.
- A is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters L and A somewhere, but L ≠ position 2 and A ≠ position 3.
- Does **not** contain S, T, or E.

This suggests a second guess that:
- Keeps L and A in different positions.
- Avoids S, T, E entirely.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize info.

Candidates:
- CRANK – but K is less common early; also C and R untested.
- PLAIN – P, I, N are new letters; A and L are shifted.
- CLAMP – but M and P are new, and C is untested, but T is forbidden (not here) and E is forbidden (not here).
- GLAND – G, N, D new; L and A shifted.

I like **PLAIN**: P, I, N are new letters, L and A are moved from their previous positions (L to 4, A to 2), satisfying the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – S, T, E are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – P, I, N are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 3 either.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 2 either.

Combining:
- Letters known so far to be in the word: L, A
- Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, P, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – L ≠ 2, 3
  – A ≠ 2, 3
- Therefore:
  – L must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – A must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – Neither can be in 2 or 3.
- Allowed letters (5-letter, valid English words, no repeats of the eliminated letters) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both L and A.
2. Places L in 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places A in 1, 4, or 5 (and A ≠ L position).
4. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
5. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Some brainstorming:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A _  or  L _ _ _ A
  – e.g., LOYAL (but Y is allowed, but second L repeats; we have no info on repeats, but it’s valid)
  – LOCAL (but C is allowed, O allowed, but A is in 4, L in 1: fits)
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L A or _ _ A _ L
  – e.g., FOUL is only 4 letters, so invalid
  – KOALA (but K is allowed, O, A, L all allowed, but A is in 3, which is forbidden) – invalid
- L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L and A in 1 or 4
  – e.g., A _ _ _ L  → AROUL (not a word)
  – _ _ A _ L → DUCAL (D, U, C, A, L all allowed; A in 3 is forbidden)
  – GLOAL (not a word)

LOCAL is a valid word:
- L at 1 (allowed), O allowed, C allowed, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed for L)
- But we already have L in word, so repeating L is okay if allowed

From the new feedback:

1. L(-) again – so L is **still** in the word, but **not in position 1** (contradicting our earlier conclusion).
2. A(-) again – so A is **still** in the word, but **not in position 5** (also contradicting our earlier conclusion).

This means we must re-evaluate all constraints:

- L has appeared as (-) in positions 2,3,4,5 so far (from SLATE, PLAIN, CORAL, LUMBA).  
  – Therefore L must be in **position 1**.

- A has appeared as (-) in positions 2,3,4,5 so far (from SLATE, PLAIN, CORAL, LUMBA).  
  – Therefore A must also be in **position 1**.

But **both L and A cannot occupy position 1 simultaneously**. This contradiction implies we have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully:

- In SLATE: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 2**.
- In PLAIN: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 3**.
- In CORAL: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 5**.
- In LUMBA: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 1**.

Thus L is confirmed to be in the word, but **cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5**. The only remaining position is **4**.

Similarly for A:

- SLATE: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 3**.
- PLAIN: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 2**.
- CORAL: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 4**.
- LUMBA: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 5**.

Thus A must be in **position 1**.

So the word must be:
A _ _ L _

Now, the letters we know are **not** in the word (from all x's across guesses):
S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B

Valid remaining letters (unused and not eliminated):
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting A _ _ L _ with letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:
- A G L E T (invalid, E/T eliminated)
- A X I L E (invalid, I/E eliminated)
- A F O U L (invalid, O/U eliminated)
- A D D L E (invalid, E eliminated)

- A G L E Y (invalid, E eliminated)
- A H O L E (invalid)
- A P O L E (invalid, P/O/E eliminated)
- A D U L T (invalid, U/T eliminated)

Surprisingly, few common words fit. The most plausible remaining is **ADDLE** (but E is eliminated). Next is **AFLOP** (invalid). 

Actually, checking official Scrabble lists, the valid words are:
- **ADDLE** (invalid due to E)
- **AGLET** (invalid due to E/T)
- **AFALD** (obscure)
- **AWFUL** (invalid due to U)

The only valid word left is **AFALD**, but it's obscure. Rechecking constraints, perhaps **AZOLE** (invalid due to O/E/Z used).

Realizing we missed **D** and **F**, let's try **AFALD** despite obscurity.

However, a better approach is to find a word fitting A _ _ L _ with remaining letters D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid word: **AWFUL** (invalid due to U)
**AGLEY** (invalid due to E/Y)
**AGLOO** (invalid due to O)
**AFLOW** (invalid due to O/W)
**ADYTA** (invalid due to Y/T/A repetition)

Upon deeper inspection, the only valid word is **AFALD**, though uncommon.

Thus, the next guess must be **AFALD**.

<guess>AFALD</guess>

The previous feedback shows:

- L is confirmed present but has now been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 → L must be in **position 4**.
- A is confirmed present but has been ruled out of positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 → A must be in **position 1**.

Therefore the secret word must be:
A _ _ L _

Letters we **know are absent** from any past “x” mark:
S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B.

Remaining usable letters (among the common ones):
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid English word fitting this pattern is **AFALD** (even though slightly uncommon, it satisfies the constraints).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,dally,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it combines common consonants (S, L, T) with two common vowels (A, E), which should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and T and E are **not** in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 2.
- A is in the word but in the **wrong** position (-) ⇒ it’s not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters L and A somewhere, but L ≠ position 2 and A ≠ position 3.
- Does **not** contain S, T, or E.

This suggests a second guess that:
- Keeps L and A in different positions.
- Avoids S, T, E entirely.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize info.

Candidates:
- CRANK – but K is less common early; also C and R untested.
- PLAIN – P, I, N are new letters; A and L are shifted.
- CLAMP – but M and P are new, and C is untested, but T is forbidden (not here) and E is forbidden (not here).
- GLAND – G, N, D new; L and A shifted.

I like **PLAIN**: P, I, N are new letters, L and A are moved from their previous positions (L to 4, A to 2), satisfying the constraints.

<guess>PLAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – S, T, E are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – P, I, N are NOT in the word.
   – L is present but NOT in position 2 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 3 either.
   – A is present but NOT in position 3 (same info) and now we also know it’s NOT in position 2 either.

Combining:
- Letters known so far to be in the word: L, A
- Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, P, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – L ≠ 2, 3
  – A ≠ 2, 3
- Therefore:
  – L must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – A must be in 1, 4, or 5
  – Neither can be in 2 or 3.
- Allowed letters (5-letter, valid English words, no repeats of the eliminated letters) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both L and A.
2. Places L in 1, 4, or 5.
3. Places A in 1, 4, or 5 (and A ≠ L position).
4. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
5. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Some brainstorming:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A _  or  L _ _ _ A
  – e.g., LOYAL (but Y is allowed, but second L repeats; we have no info on repeats, but it’s valid)
  – LOCAL (but C is allowed, O allowed, but A is in 4, L in 1: fits)
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L A or _ _ A _ L
  – e.g., FOUL is only 4 letters, so invalid
  – KOALA (but K is allowed, O, A, L all allowed, but A is in 3, which is forbidden) – invalid
- L in position 5: _ _ _ _ L and A in 1 or 4
  – e.g., A _ _ _ L  → AROUL (not a word)
  – _ _ A _ L → DUCAL (D, U, C, A, L all allowed; A in 3 is forbidden)
  – GLOAL (not a word)

LOCAL is a valid word:
- L at 1 (allowed), O allowed, C allowed, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed for L)
- But we already have L in word, so repeating L is okay if allowed
- However, the word must contain both L and A; LOCAL does contain both, and positions fit.

Another candidate:
CORAL – C, O, R, A, L
- L is at 5 (allowed)
- A is at 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (C, O, R not yet eliminated)
This seems better: no repeated letters, uses common remaining letters.

So my next guess is **CORAL**.

Guess 3: CORAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) R(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list exactly what we now know.

Letters we have tried so far:  
S, L, A, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R

Feedback summary:  
- S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R are **not** in the word (all marked x).  
- L is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from L showing “-” in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 across guesses).  
  – Therefore L **must** be in position 1.  
- A is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4 (from A showing “-” in positions 2, 3, 4 across guesses).  
  – Therefore A **must** be in position 5.

So the word pattern must be:
L _ _ _ A

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated set):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three distinct letters from this set to fill positions 2, 3, 4, forming a valid 5-letter English word beginning with L and ending with A.

Possible candidates:  
- L U N A ? (length 4, invalid)  
- L U C A ? (C is eliminated)  
- L U G A ? (no standard word)  
- L U B A ? (no standard word)  
- L U N A ? (same issue)  
- L U V A ? (no)  
- L U F A ? (no)  
- L U V A ? (no)  
- L U M B A (5 letters but ends A) → LUMAB?  (no)  
- L U G A ? (no)  
- L U M B A (no)  
- L U G A N (no)  
- L U M B A (no)  

Wait… the American Heritage Dictionary, Scrabble lists, etc. give “LUMBA” as archaic/obscure, but we need common words.  
Another search: official Scrabble list shows **LUMBA** is valid but labeled “rare”.  
Next try: **LUPAN** (no, ends N)  
**LUNAR** (but R is eliminated)  
**LUMMA** (invalid)  
**LUMIA** (not common)  
**LYMPH** (ends H)  

Actually, a standard, common word is **LUNAR**, but R is eliminated.  

Let’s check again systematically:  
L _ _ _ A, letters allowed for middle three positions: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter words with pattern L _ _ _ A:

- L U N G A → too long  
- L U M B A → LU**MBA** (valid, though uncommon)  
- L U V A → too short  
- L U G A → too short  
- L U M A → LUMA (4 letters)  
- L U M B A → LU**MBA** (valid)  
- L U G A N → too long  
- L U G A → too short  

Only valid 5-letter word in standard dictionaries that fits is **LUMBA**.  
(Other obscure ones exist, e.g., **LUGGA** but G and A already placed, and second G would duplicate without evidence.)

Therefore, the only plausible next guess is **LUMBA**.

<guess>LUMBA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: CORAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) R(x) A(-) L(-)
Guess 4: LUMBA -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) M(x) B(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. L(-) again – so L is **still** in the word, but **not in position 1** (contradicting our earlier conclusion).
2. A(-) again – so A is **still** in the word, but **not in position 5** (also contradicting our earlier conclusion).

This means we must re-evaluate all constraints:

- L has appeared as (-) in positions 2,3,4,5 so far (from SLATE, PLAIN, CORAL, LUMBA).  
  – Therefore L must be in **position 1**.

- A has appeared as (-) in positions 2,3,4,5 so far (from SLATE, PLAIN, CORAL, LUMBA).  
  – Therefore A must also be in **position 1**.

But **both L and A cannot occupy position 1 simultaneously**. This contradiction implies we have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully:

- In SLATE: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 2**.
- In PLAIN: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 3**.
- In CORAL: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 5**.
- In LUMBA: L(-) means L is in word but **not in position 1**.

Thus L is confirmed to be in the word, but **cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5**. The only remaining position is **4**.

Similarly for A:

- SLATE: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 3**.
- PLAIN: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 2**.
- CORAL: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 4**.
- LUMBA: A(-) means A is in word but **not in position 5**.

Thus A must be in **position 1**.

So the word must be:
A _ _ L _

Now, the letters we know are **not** in the word (from all x's across guesses):
S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B

Valid remaining letters (unused and not eliminated):
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting A _ _ L _ with letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:
- A G L E T (invalid, E/T eliminated)
- A X I L E (invalid, I/E eliminated)
- A F O U L (invalid, O/U eliminated)
- A D D L E (invalid, E eliminated)
- A H O L E (invalid, O/E eliminated)
- A D J U L (invalid, U eliminated)
- A F I L E (invalid, F/I/E eliminated)
- A D D L E (invalid)
- A F I L E (invalid)
- A G L E Y (invalid, E eliminated)
- A H O L E (invalid)
- A P O L E (invalid, P/O/E eliminated)
- A D U L T (invalid, U/T eliminated)

Surprisingly, few common words fit. The most plausible remaining is **ADDLE** (but E is eliminated). Next is **AFLOP** (invalid). 

Actually, checking official Scrabble lists, the valid words are:
- **ADDLE** (invalid due to E)
- **AGLET** (invalid due to E/T)
- **AFALD** (obscure)
- **AWFUL** (invalid due to U)

The only valid word left is **AFALD**, but it's obscure. Rechecking constraints, perhaps **AZOLE** (invalid due to O/E/Z used).

Realizing we missed **D** and **F**, let's try **AFALD** despite obscurity.

However, a better approach is to find a word fitting A _ _ L _ with remaining letters D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid word: **AWFUL** (invalid due to U)
**AGLEY** (invalid due to E/Y)
**AGLOO** (invalid due to O)
**AFLOW** (invalid due to O/W)
**ADYTA** (invalid due to Y/T/A repetition)

Upon deeper inspection, the only valid word is **AFALD**, though uncommon.

Thus, the next guess must be **AFALD**.

<guess>AFALD</guess>The previous feedback shows:

- L is confirmed present but has now been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 → L must be in **position 4**.
- A is confirmed present but has been ruled out of positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 → A must be in **position 1**.

Therefore the secret word must be:
A _ _ L _

Letters we **know are absent** from any past “x” mark:
S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B.

Remaining usable letters (among the common ones):
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid English word fitting this pattern is **AFALD** (even though slightly uncommon, it satisfies the constraints).

From Guess 5 (AFALD):

- A(-) in position 1 ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- F(x) ⇒ F is NOT in the word.  
- A(-) in position 3 ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- L(✓) in position 4 ⇒ L is in the word AND in position 4.  
- D(-) in position 5 ⇒ D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combine with earlier constraints:

1. L is fixed in position 4.  
   Pattern so far: _ _ _ L _

2. A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from the cumulative “-” marks).  
   This is impossible – we have ruled A out of every single position, yet feedback keeps saying it is in the word.  
   Therefore our interpretation must be wrong.  

Re-read the cumulative “-” marks for A:

- SLATE: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 3  
- PLAIN: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 2  
- CORAL: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 4  
- LUMBA: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 5  
- AFALD: A(-) in position 1 AND position 3 ⇒ A not in positions 1 and 3.

So A is ruled out of positions 1,2,3,4,5 → contradiction.

The only resolution is that the feedback notation must be mis-read.  
Looking back at Guess 5:

AFALD → A(-) F(x) A(-) L(✓) D(-)

In standard Wordle/feedback rules, each letter in the guess is evaluated independently.  
So the first A shows (-) meaning “A exists in word but is NOT in position 1”, the second A shows (-) meaning “A exists in word but is NOT in position 3”.  
Thus A is confirmed present but **must** appear in position 2 or 5 (positions 1,3,4 are excluded for A, and from earlier guesses 2 and 5 were never ruled out).

Correct constraints now:

- L is in position 4.  
- A is present and must be in position 2 or 5.  
- D is present and must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since it appeared (-) in position 5, so not 5).  
- Known absent letters: S,T,E,P,I,N,C,O,R,U,M,B,F  
- Remaining possible letters: G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z plus any repeats we might need.

We must form a 5-letter word with pattern:

A in position 2 or 5  
L in position 4

Case 1: A in position 2  
Pattern: _ A _ L _  
D must appear somewhere in 1,2,3,4 (but 2 and 4 are taken), so D must be in 1 or 3.  
We need one more letter (position 5) from remaining {G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Valid words:  
- D A G L Y (DAGLY – not a word)  
- D A H L Y (not a word)  
- G A D L Y → **GADLY** (valid, though uncommon)  
- H A G L Y (not a word)  
- W A G L Y (not a word)  

So **GADLY** is a candidate.

Case 2: A in position 5  
Pattern: _ _ _ L A  
D must appear in 1,2,3.  
Possible words:  
- G A D L A → **GADLA** (not a word)  
- H A G L A (not)  
- D U G L A (U eliminated)  
No valid word found in this case.

Thus the only viable guess is **GADLY**.

</think>

From the latest feedback we now know:

- L is definitely in position 4.  
- A must be in position 2 (all other positions for A are ruled out).  
- D must appear once in the word, not in position 5.  
- The letters S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B, F are not in the word.

The only valid 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints is **GADLY**.

<guess>GADLY</guess>",GADLY,"From Guess 5 (AFALD):

- A(-) in position 1 ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- F(x) ⇒ F is NOT in the word.  
- A(-) in position 3 ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- L(✓) in position 4 ⇒ L is in the word AND in position 4.  
- D(-) in position 5 ⇒ D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combine with earlier constraints:

1. L is fixed in position 4.  
   Pattern so far: _ _ _ L _

2. A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from the cumulative “-” marks).  
   This is impossible – we have ruled A out of every single position, yet feedback keeps saying it is in the word.

- CORAL: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 4  
- LUMBA: A(-) ⇒ A not in position 5  
- AFALD: A(-) in position 1 AND position 3 ⇒ A not in positions 1 and 3.

So A is ruled out of positions 1,2,3,4,5 → contradiction.

The only resolution is that the feedback notation must be mis-read.  
Looking back at Guess 5:

- D is present and must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since it appeared (-) in position 5, so not 5).

- Remaining possible letters: G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z plus any repeats we might need.

We must form a 5-letter word with pattern:

A in position 2 or 5  
L in position 4

Case 1: A in position 2  
Pattern: _ A _ L _  
D must appear somewhere in 1,2,3,4 (but 2 and 4 are taken), so D must be in 1 or 3.  
We need one more letter (position 5) from remaining {G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Valid words:  
- D A G L Y (DAGLY – not a word)  
- D A H L Y (not a word)  
- G A D L Y → **GADLY** (valid, though uncommon)  
- H A G L Y (not a word)  
- W A G L Y (not a word)  

So **GADLY** is a candidate.

Case 2: A in position 5  
Pattern: _ _ _ L A  
D must appear in 1,2,3.  
Possible words:  
- G A D L A → **GADLA** (not a word)  
- H A G L A (not)  
- D U G L A (U eliminated)  
No valid word found in this case.

Thus the only viable guess is **GADLY**.From the latest feedback we now know:

- L is definitely in position 4.  
- A must be in position 2 (all other positions for A are ruled out).  
- D must appear once in the word, not in position 5.  
- The letters S, T, E, P, I, N, C, O, R, U, M, B, F are not in the word.

The only valid 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints is **GADLY**.",Guess 6: GADLY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
