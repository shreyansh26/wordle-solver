For the first guess, we want to choose a word that tests common letters and letter positions to maximize information. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

All these words include common letters and at least three vowels (A, E, O). Among these, CRANE stands out because it includes C and N, which are also common consonants. This combination allows us to test R, A, N, E, and C in a single guess.

Therefore, CRANE is a strong first guess to gather information about the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓).

So we know the word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
and none of C, R, N occur elsewhere.

Letters still available (excluding C, R, N): A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that ends in A E and avoids C, R, N. Common patterns fitting _ _ A _ E include:

- Vowel in 2nd position: e.g., SLATE (but L, S, T are allowed)
- Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SLATE (but we already know A and E are in positions 3 and 5, so S L A T E is valid, but we've already tested A and E positions)
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) – valid, but G is less common
- SHAPE (S, H, A, P, E) – includes P, which is common
- STAKE (S, T, A, K, E) – includes K, which is less common
- BLAME (B, L, A, M, E) – includes B and M, which are common

BLAME seems like a good choice – it introduces common letters B, L, M and doesn't repeat any letters from CRANE except A and E, which we already know are correct.

We now know the pattern is _ _ A _ E and the letters C, R, N, B, L, M, P, H, S are all excluded.

Available consonants for positions 1, 2, 4 (excluding the forbidden ones):
D, F, G, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Available vowels for positions 1, 2 (since position 3 is A, 5 is E):
I, O, U are the remaining vowels, but position 2 can also take these.

We want a valid English word that fits _ _ A _ E and only uses allowed letters. Common words that come to mind:

- GRAZE – G and Z allowed, fits G R A Z E, but R is forbidden.
- GLADE – G allowed, L forbidden.
- GRADE – R forbidden.
- FLAKE – F allowed, L forbidden.
- SKATE – S and K allowed, S is forbidden, K is allowed.
- STAKE – S and T allowed, S is forbidden.
- DWALE – D, W, L, E; L forbidden.
- QUAKE – Q, U, A, K, E – Q, U, K allowed, fits pattern _ _ A _ E.

So let's try QUAKE: Q, U, A, K, E.
- Q in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (already confirmed)
- K in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (already confirmed)

QUAKE is a valid word and uses none of the forbidden letters.
