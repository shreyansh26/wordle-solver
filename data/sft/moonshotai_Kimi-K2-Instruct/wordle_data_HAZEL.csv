Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help identify multiple possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first word should contain several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It uses each letter only once
3. It covers all vowels except U and the very common consonants R and S
4. It can help identify many possible word patterns

This will give us maximum information about what letters are in the word and their possible positions.

A strong candidate is “EARTH”, but it has R (eliminated).
Another candidate is “HEART”, but again it has R.
“LATEX” has X (less common).
“MEANT” uses M, N, T (all common) and puts A in position 2 and E in position 1.

- HEADY – H, D, Y untested; A in pos 2 (allowed), E in pos 1 (allowed) → looks good.
- BEACH – B, C, H untested; A in pos 3 (ruled out) → invalid.
- DEALT – uses T (already ruled out) → invalid.

HEADY satisfies all constraints:
Letters: H, E, A, D, Y  
- A in position 3 is ruled out, but here A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E in position 1 is allowed (only position 2 and 5 ruled out).  
- Uses three new consonants (H, D, Y) to maximize info gain.

From HEADY we now know:

Present letters: H, A, E
Absent letters: R, O, S, M, N, T, D, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
A – cannot be 1, 3
E – cannot be 2, 5
H – is in position 1 (✓)

So the word must start with H.

We still need to place A and E in their allowed slots:
- A may be in positions 2, 4, 5
- E may be in positions 1, 3, 4   (but 1 is already H, so 3 or 4)

Allowed consonants left to try (common ones): B, C, F, G, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s consider patterns:

H _ _ _ _
Known we must use A and E somewhere after the first letter.

Possibilities:
H A E _ _   (E in 3rd; A in 2nd) – check if words exist
H _ A E _   (A in 3rd – ruled out for A) – invalid
H _ _ A E   (A in 4th, E in 5th – E in 5th is ruled out) – invalid
H _ E A _   (E in 3rd, A in 4th) – valid
H _ _ E A   (E in 4th, A in 5th) – valid

So candidate forms:
H A E _ _
H _ E A _
H _ _ E A

Tentative words:
HAE?? – no common 5-letter word starting HAE.
H B E A ? – HEAVE? uses V (allowed) but has V in 5th and A in 4th – valid.
H C E A ? – CHEAP? uses P (allowed) – but C is 2nd, H is 1st – HCEAP – invalid.
H E A _ _ – HEARD? uses R (ruled out) – invalid.
H E _ A _ – H E L A ? – HELIX? uses X – but A is 4th? HELIX has I not A.
H _ _ E A – H P L E A – H P L E A – not a word.

Let me list real words that fit:
- HEAVE: H E A V E – but E is 2nd (ruled out) – invalid.
- HEAPS: H E A P S – E 2nd (ruled out), S absent – invalid.
- HEALY – not valid.
- HEART – R absent – invalid.
- HEAVY – V allowed, Y absent – invalid.
- H E A L Y – Y absent – invalid.

Alternative approach: H _ E A _
H B E A M – BEAM not starting H.
H C E A P – invalid order.
H L E A F – LEAF part but not starting H.
H P E A K – PEAK not starting H.

Wait, let’s list 5-letter words starting with H and containing both A and E in allowed positions.

Valid candidates:
HEAVE – E 2nd (ruled out)
HEAPS – E 2nd (ruled out)
HEALTH – 6 letters
HEATH – 5 letters: H E A T H – T absent, E 2nd (ruled out)
HEAVE – same
HEAVY – same
HEADY – already tried
HEARD – R absent
HEART – R absent
H E A L D – not common

Hmm, let’s consider H _ _ E A – A in 5th is allowed for A, E in 4th is allowed.
Words:
H E L E A – invalid
H E N E A – invalid
H E P E A – invalid
H E C E A – invalid
H E B E A – invalid
H E F E A – invalid

Actually, let’s try H E L P A – but P, L, A – valid letters, but not a word.

Real word search: H _ _ E A
- HAKEA – uses K, A in 5th, E in 4th – but K is allowed, and it’s a real word (type of Australian shrub) – may be obscure.
- HYENA – Y absent – invalid.

Another form: H A _ E _ – A in 2nd allowed, E in 4th allowed.
- H A V E N – H A V E N – positions:
  H ✓ (1st)
  A (-) but in 2nd – allowed
  V – allowed
  E (-) in 4th – allowed
  N – absent – invalid
- H A Z E L – Z allowed, L allowed – but L not yet ruled out – but N is absent, Z is allowed.
  H A Z E L – letters: H, A, Z, E, L – all allowed (Z not tested, L not tested).  
  Positions:
  A in 2nd – allowed
  E in 4th – allowed
  H in 1st – correct
  Z, L – new consonants.

This seems the most promising real word.
