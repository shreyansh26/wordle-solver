For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting some feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct letters from these common ones. 

Some good options include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters and no repeats.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain the letters C, R, N, or E.

Next, I still want to use common letters we haven’t tried yet. Good remaining common letters include S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

Since A is definitely present and can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, I’ll try a word that uses A along with other untested common letters. A good candidate is “STOAL” but that’s not a common word. A better choice is “STOMA” (common letters S, T, O, M, A), but that uses A in the 5th position, which is allowed. Another solid option is “PLAID” – but we’ve already ruled out D? No, D hasn’t been used yet. However, “PLAID” has D, which is fine, but we haven’t ruled it in or out. 

Let me pick “PLAID” – it contains A (allowed), and introduces P, L, I, D, none of which have been ruled out yet.

Wait, actually “PLAID” has A in the 3rd position, which is where it was marked wrong (-) in CRANE, so A cannot be in position 3. So “PLAID” is invalid for A placement. 

A better word is “PLASM” but M hasn’t been ruled out, and A is in the 4th position, which is allowed. However, “PLASM” is a bit obscure. 

Another good word is “SLANT” but N is already ruled out. 

A better option is “SALTY” – but Y is less common. 

Let me go with “PLASH” – but H is less common. 

Actually, “STOMA” is the best choice – S, T, O, M, A – all common letters, A is in the 5th position (allowed), and none of C, R, N, E are used. 

But “STOMA” is a bit technical. 

Another option is “COAST” – but C is ruled out. 

“BOAST” is good – B, O, A, S, T – all common, none ruled out, and A is in position 3 which is where it was marked (-) in CRANE, so A cannot be in position 3. Thus “BOAST” is invalid for A placement. 

“ADIOS” – A in position 1, which is allowed, and introduces D, I, O, S. 

I’ll go with “ADIOS”.

Wait, but A is in position 1 here, which is allowed, and we haven’t tried D, I, O, S. 

However, “STOMA” is more common, and A is in position 5 – allowed. 

I think “STOMA” is better. 

But “STOMA” is not a common word, so I’ll choose “STAMP” – S, T, A, M, P – all common, A in position 3 which is disallowed. 

“SWATH” – W is less common. 

“STALK” – L, K – K is less common. 

“STOMA” seems best despite being technical. 

But let me think of another: “PASTA” – A in positions 2 and 5, but 3 is disallowed, so positions 2 and 5 are fine.

From the new feedback on PASTA:

- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- A(-) → The second A (position 5) is in the word but not in position 5.  
  (This tells us the word must have an A somewhere other than position 5, but we already have A fixed in position 2, so this is redundant.)

So far we know:
- Word starts with P A _ _ _
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S
- Letters we haven’t ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and maybe others.

Next, I want a word that starts with P A and uses common remaining letters. Good candidates include:
- PAINT – but N is out.
- PATTY – but S is out and Y is less common.
- PARTY – R is out.
- PASTE – S, E are out.
- PATCH – H is possible.
- PATIO – I and O are possible.
- PATLY – L and Y, but Y is less common.
- PATSY – S is out.
- PAWNS – W, N are out or less common.
- PAYED – Y is less common.

The best common word seems “PATCH” – but let’s confirm:
- Starts with P A (matches ✓✓).
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (in PATCH, T is in position 3, which satisfies T(-)).
- H has not been ruled out.
- C, R, N, E, S are not used.

Another good option is “PATIO” – but I is in position 4, T is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 5.

But “PATCH” tests H and C (but C is already out). Actually C is out, so “PATCH” is invalid due to C.

Next best is “PATIO” – no ruled-out letters.

Another is “PATLY” – Y is possible.

I’ll go with “PATIO” as it introduces I and O, common vowels.

<guess>PATIO</guess>",PATIO,"From the new feedback on PASTA:
- P(✓) → P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- A(-) → The second A (position 5) is in the word but not in position 5.  
  (This tells us the word must have an A somewhere other than position 5, but we already have A fixed in position 2, so this is redundant.)

So far we know:
- Word starts with P A _ _ _
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S
- Letters we haven’t ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and maybe others.

Next, I want a word that starts with P A and uses common remaining letters. Good candidates include:
- PAINT – but N is out.
- PATTY – but S is out and Y is less common.
- PARTY – R is out.
- PASTE – S, E are out.
- PATCH – H is possible.
- PATIO – I and O are possible.
- PATLY – L and Y, but Y is less common.
- PATSY – S is out.
- PAWNS – W, N are out or less common.
- PAYED – Y is less common.

The best common word seems “PATCH” – but let’s confirm:
- Starts with P A (matches ✓✓).
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (in PATCH, T is in position 3, which satisfies T(-)).
- H has not been ruled out.
- C, R, N, E, S are not used.
