For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and has a good chance of matching some letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, P, M, H

A strong first word should cover these common letters. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of both vowels and consonants, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and L are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
Position 5 = T  
Letters somewhere in the word: A, E  
Letters definitely absent: S, L

For the second guess we want to:
1. keep T in position 5.
2. place A and E in new positions.
3. avoid S and L entirely.
4. introduce new common consonants to test.

Possible consonants to test now: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these conditions is “EARTH”:
- Uses A and E in new spots.
- Ends with T (✓).
- Introduces R and H.
- No S or L.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.
