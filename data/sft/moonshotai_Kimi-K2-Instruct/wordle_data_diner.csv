For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Some great starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it uses C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters in English words. C and R are common consonants, A and E are the two most common vowels, and N is also frequently used. This should give me good information about several letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but **not** C or A.  
Positions we know:
- R is not in position 2
- N is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

We need a word that uses R, N, E and avoids C and A.  
Good candidates:  
- R is allowed in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)  
- N is allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)  
- E is allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)  

Possible next guesses:  
- “SNORE” – uses S, N, O, R, E  
- “NERVE” – uses N, E, R, V, E (but repeats E)  
- “TREND” – uses T, R, E, N, D  

I'll choose “SNORE” because it reuses R, N, E and introduces two new letters (S and O) to test more possibilities.

Recap the new information after the second guess:

Letters still known to be in the word (somewhere, positions unknown):
- R  
- N  
- E  

Letters now known **not** in the word:
- C, A, S, O

So our third guess must:
- contain R, N, and E exactly once each  
- not contain C, A, S or O  
- not put R in position 2 or 4 (because in CRANE and SNORE it was “-”, indicating wrong position)  
- not put N in position 2 or 4 (same reason)  
- not put E in position 3 or 5 (same reason)  

We also need a five-letter word that satisfies all of these constraints.

Possible placements:
R can go in 1, 3, 5 (but not 2,4)
N can go in 1, 3, 5 (but not 2,4)
E can go in 1, 2, 4 (but not 3,5)

A good word that fits is “INNER” — but it repeats N, which might not help.
How about “ENTRY”? It contains E, N, R (each once), and adds T and Y which are new. Let’s check positions:
E is in position 1 – allowed (not 3 or 5)  
N is in position 2 – **not allowed** (N was “-” in position 2 in SNORE).  
So that fails.

Try “NERVE” – V is new; positions:
N(1) – allowed  
E(2) – allowed  
R(3) – allowed  
V(4) – new  
E(5) – **not allowed** (E was “-” in position 5 in SNORE).  
Fails.

Try “FRENZ” – Z is new, but positions:  
F(1) new  
R(2) – **not allowed**  
Fails.

Try “RENTS” – S already excluded.

Try “UNDER” – U and D are new; positions:
U(1) new  
N(2) – **not allowed**  
Fails.

Try “DINER” – D and I are new; positions:
D(1) new  
I(2) new  
N(3) – allowed  
E(4) – allowed  
R(5) – allowed  

This word uses R, N, E exactly once each, avoids all excluded letters, and respects all positional constraints.

Therefore, a valid third guess is “DINER”.
