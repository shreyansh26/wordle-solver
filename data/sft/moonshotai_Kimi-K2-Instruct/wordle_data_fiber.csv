When making the first guess in Wordle, the optimal strategy is to choose a word with common letters that provides maximum information. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A very strong starting word that combines these is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- Both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeated letters

Another excellent choice is ""RAISE"" which has:
- R, A, I, S, E - again covering top frequency letters
- Good vowel coverage (A, I, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

Between these, ""RAISE"" is slightly better because:
1. I is slightly more common than L
2. The combination R+S appears frequently in 5-letter words
3. It tests 3 vowels (A, I, E) which is great for early vowel identification

Therefore, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.

The feedback tells us:

- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 1 gives E _ R _ I → leads to “EERIE” (invalid repeats).

- “CRIER” – has T (forbidden) and a double R – not ideal.

- “REBID” – no T, no A, no S, no N; it has R, E, I:
  – R is pos 1 → forbidden for R – discard.

- “FRIED” – has a T? No, but has F, R, I, E, D.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>When making the first guess in Wordle, the optimal strategy is to choose a word with common letters that provides maximum information. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A very strong starting word that combines these is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- Both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeated letters

Another excellent choice is ""RAISE"" which has:
- R, A, I, S, E - again covering top frequency letters
- Good vowel coverage (A, I, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

Between these, ""RAISE"" is slightly better because:
1. I is slightly more common than L
2. The combination R+S appears frequently in 5-letter words
3. It tests 3 vowels (A, I, E) which is great for early vowel identification

Therefore, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:

- R is in the word, but NOT in the first position.  
- A is NOT in the word at all.  
- I is in the word, but NOT in the third position.  
- S is NOT in the word at all.  
- E is in the word, but NOT in the fifth position.

So we need:
- A 5-letter word with NO A and NO S.  
- Must contain both R and I, and must contain E.  
- R cannot be in position 1.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- E cannot be in position 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
– “TRIBE” satisfies:
  – T R I B E  
  – R is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – I is in position 3 → forbidden (feedback says I cannot be in position 3)  
  – reject.

– “CRIME” satisfies:
  – C R I M E  
  – R in position 2  
  – I in position 3 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “DRIER” has two R’s → less informative.

– “DIRGE” satisfies:
  – D I R G E  
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only on position 1 for R)  
  – I in position 2 (allowed, restriction is only on position 3 for I)  
  – E in position 5 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “REIGN” satisfies:
  – R E I G N  
  – R in position 1 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “INERT” satisfies:
  – I N E R T  
  – I in position 1 (allowed)  
  – R in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E in position 3 (allowed)  
  – uses none of the forbidden letters (A, S) and meets all positional constraints.

So “INERT” looks good.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we must include (they both got “-”):
- R, I, E  (each must be in the word but not in the positions they just occupied)

Letters we must exclude (they got “x”):
- A, S, N, T

Positions that each of R, I, E are **forbidden**:
- R: cannot be in position 1 (guess 1) or position 4 (guess 2)
- I: cannot be in position 3 (guess 1) or position 1 (guess 2)
- E: cannot be in position 5 (guess 1) or position 3 (guess 2)

So allowed positions:
- R: 2, 3, 5
- I: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need a 5-letter word that contains R, I, E, uses none of A, S, N, T, and places each of R, I, E in one of their allowed positions.

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit:
- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 4, “E” in position 1 gives us the pattern E _ R I _ → but we don’t have a word like that.

- “R” in position 3, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 2 gives _ E _ R I → leads to “BERIO”? Not valid.

- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 1 gives E _ R _ I → leads to “EERIE” (invalid repeats).

- “CRIER” – has T (forbidden) and a double R – not ideal.

- “REBID” – no T, no A, no S, no N; it has R, E, I:
  – R is pos 1 → forbidden for R – discard.

- “FRIED” – has a T? No, but has F, R, I, E, D.
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden (from guess 1) – discard.

- “PRICE” – contains C and P, no forbidden letters.
  – P R I C E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “BRIDE” – B R I D E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “DIRGE” – D I R G E
  – I pos 2 – allowed
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – E pos 5 – forbidden – discard.

- “DRIER” – contains a second R and an extra E; also positions of R conflict.

- “GRIPE” – G R I P E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “RIDGE” – R pos 1 – forbidden.

- “PERIL” – has an L we haven’t ruled out, but no T, A, S, N.
  – P E R I L
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – I pos 4 – allowed
  – E pos 2 – allowed
  – uses only allowed letters P, E, R, I, L.
  – fits every constraint.

Therefore “PERIL” is the best next candidate.

From the three rounds we now have:

Mandatory letters (all three guesses say “-” for them):
- R, I, E

Forbidden letters (got “x” in any guess):
- A, S, N, T, P, L

Forbidden positions for the mandatory letters:
- R: cannot be 1 (guess 1), 4 (guess 2), 3 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- I: cannot be 3 (guess 1), 1 (guess 2), 4 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- E: cannot be 5 (guess 1), 3 (guess 2), 2 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 1, 4

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. contains R, I, E (exactly once each),
2. uses none of A, S, N, T, P, L,
3. places R only in positions 2 or 5,
4. places I only in positions 2 or 5,
5. places E only in positions 1 or 4.

The remaining letters free to use (common English, not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must choose two additional distinct letters from this set to fill the two remaining slots.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Pattern: E _ _ _ _  
Then R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Possible sub-cases:  
- E R _ _ I → need two middle letters, but only one slot is open; impossible.  
- E I _ _ R → same, impossible.  
So E cannot be in position 1.

Case 2: E in position 4  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _  
R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Sub-cases:

a) R in 2, I in 5 → _ R _ E I  
   The third letter (position 3) must be from the allowed list and distinct.  
   Candidate: C R O E I? No; must be a real word.  
   Real word: C R O W E is 6 letters.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Contains D (allowed) and no forbidden letters, but I would be in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I E F? I in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: G R I E F? Same.  
   Real word: B R O K E? Doesn’t contain I.  
   Real word: C R I M E? Contains M, but C, R, I, M, E – positions: C(1) R(2) I(3) M(4) E(5)?  I in 3 is forbidden.  
   Real word: M E R I T? T is forbidden.  
   Real word: D R I V E? V is allowed, positions: D(1) R(2) I(3) V(4) E(5) – I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Already seen.  
   Real word: W R I T E? T forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I D E? D is allowed, letters B, R, I, D, E – but I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: C R E D I? Not a word.

b) I in 2, R in 5 → _ I _ E R  
   Need first and third letters from allowed set.  
   Real word: C I D E R? letters C, I, D, E, R – positions: C(1) I(2) D(3) E(4) R(5)  
   Check constraints:  
     - R is in 5 – allowed.  
     - I is in 2 – allowed.  
     - E is in 4 – allowed.  
     - All letters OK (no A,S,N,T,P,L).  
   This fits perfectly.

- E cannot be in position 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
– “TRIBE” satisfies:
  – T R I B E  
  – R is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – I is in position 3 → forbidden (feedback says I cannot be in position 3)  
  – reject.

– “CRIME” satisfies:
  – C R I M E  
  – R in position 2  
  – I in position 3 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “DRIER” has two R’s → less informative.

– “DIRGE” satisfies:
  – D I R G E  
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only on position 1 for R)  
  – I in position 2 (allowed, restriction is only on position 3 for I)  
  – E in position 5 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “REIGN” satisfies:
  – R E I G N  
  – R in position 1 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “INERT” satisfies:
  – I N E R T  
  – I in position 1 (allowed)  
  – R in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E in position 3 (allowed)  
  – uses none of the forbidden letters (A, S) and meets all positional constraints.

So “INERT” looks good.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we must include (they both got “-”):
- R, I, E  (each must be in the word but not in the positions they just occupied)

Letters we must exclude (they got “x”):
- A, S, N, T

Positions that each of R, I, E are **forbidden**:
- R: cannot be in position 1 (guess 1) or position 4 (guess 2)
- I: cannot be in position 3 (guess 1) or position 1 (guess 2)
- E: cannot be in position 5 (guess 1) or position 3 (guess 2)

So allowed positions:
- R: 2, 3, 5
- I: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need a 5-letter word that contains R, I, E, uses none of A, S, N, T, and places each of R, I, E in one of their allowed positions.

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit:
- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 4, “E” in position 1 gives us the pattern E _ R I _ → but we don’t have a word like that.

- “R” in position 3, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 2 gives _ E _ R I → leads to “BERIO”? Not valid.

- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 1 gives E _ R _ I → leads to “EERIE” (invalid repeats).

- “CRIER” – has T (forbidden) and a double R – not ideal.

- “REBID” – no T, no A, no S, no N; it has R, E, I:
  – R is pos 1 → forbidden for R – discard.

- “FRIED” – has a T? No, but has F, R, I, E, D.
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden (from guess 1) – discard.

- “PRICE” – contains C and P, no forbidden letters.
  – P R I C E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “BRIDE” – B R I D E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “DIRGE” – D I R G E
  – I pos 2 – allowed
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – E pos 5 – forbidden – discard.

- “DRIER” – contains a second R and an extra E; also positions of R conflict.

- “GRIPE” – G R I P E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “RIDGE” – R pos 1 – forbidden.

- “PERIL” – has an L we haven’t ruled out, but no T, A, S, N.
  – P E R I L
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – I pos 4 – allowed
  – E pos 2 – allowed
  – uses only allowed letters P, E, R, I, L.
  – fits every constraint.

Therefore “PERIL” is the best next candidate.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
Guess 3: PERIL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds we now have:

Mandatory letters (all three guesses say “-” for them):
- R, I, E

Forbidden letters (got “x” in any guess):
- A, S, N, T, P, L

Forbidden positions for the mandatory letters:
- R: cannot be 1 (guess 1), 4 (guess 2), 3 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- I: cannot be 3 (guess 1), 1 (guess 2), 4 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- E: cannot be 5 (guess 1), 3 (guess 2), 2 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 1, 4

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. contains R, I, E (exactly once each),
2. uses none of A, S, N, T, P, L,
3. places R only in positions 2 or 5,
4. places I only in positions 2 or 5,
5. places E only in positions 1 or 4.

The remaining letters free to use (common English, not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must choose two additional distinct letters from this set to fill the two remaining slots.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Pattern: E _ _ _ _  
Then R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Possible sub-cases:  
- E R _ _ I → need two middle letters, but only one slot is open; impossible.  
- E I _ _ R → same, impossible.  
So E cannot be in position 1.

Case 2: E in position 4  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _  
R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Sub-cases:

a) R in 2, I in 5 → _ R _ E I  
   The third letter (position 3) must be from the allowed list and distinct.  
   Candidate: C R O E I? No; must be a real word.  
   Real word: C R O W E is 6 letters.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Contains D (allowed) and no forbidden letters, but I would be in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I E F? I in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: G R I E F? Same.  
   Real word: B R O K E? Doesn’t contain I.  
   Real word: C R I M E? Contains M, but C, R, I, M, E – positions: C(1) R(2) I(3) M(4) E(5)?  I in 3 is forbidden.  
   Real word: M E R I T? T is forbidden.  
   Real word: D R I V E? V is allowed, positions: D(1) R(2) I(3) V(4) E(5) – I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Already seen.  
   Real word: W R I T E? T forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I D E? D is allowed, letters B, R, I, D, E – but I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: C R E D I? Not a word.

b) I in 2, R in 5 → _ I _ E R  
   Need first and third letters from allowed set.  
   Real word: C I D E R? letters C, I, D, E, R – positions: C(1) I(2) D(3) E(4) R(5)  
   Check constraints:  
     - R is in 5 – allowed.  
     - I is in 2 – allowed.  
     - E is in 4 – allowed.  
     - All letters OK (no A,S,N,T,P,L).  
   This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “CIDER”.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>When making the first guess in Wordle, the optimal strategy is to choose a word with common letters that provides maximum information. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A very strong starting word that combines these is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- Both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeated letters

Another excellent choice is ""RAISE"" which has:
- R, A, I, S, E - again covering top frequency letters
- Good vowel coverage (A, I, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

Between these, ""RAISE"" is slightly better because:
1. I is slightly more common than L
2. The combination R+S appears frequently in 5-letter words
3. It tests 3 vowels (A, I, E) which is great for early vowel identification

Therefore, ""RAISE"" is my first guess.

  – R is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – I is in position 3 → forbidden (feedback says I cannot be in position 3)  
  – reject.

– “CRIME” satisfies:
  – C R I M E  
  – R in position 2  
  – I in position 3 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “DRIER” has two R’s → less informative.

– “DIRGE” satisfies:
  – D I R G E  
  – R in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only on position 1 for R)  
  – I in position 2 (allowed, restriction is only on position 3 for I)  
  – E in position 5 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “REIGN” satisfies:
  – R E I G N  
  – R in position 1 → forbidden  
  – reject.

– “INERT” satisfies:
  – I N E R T  
  – I in position 1 (allowed)  
  – R in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E in position 3 (allowed)  
  – uses none of the forbidden letters (A, S) and meets all positional constraints.

So “INERT” looks good.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we must include (they both got “-”):
- R, I, E  (each must be in the word but not in the positions they just occupied)

Letters we must exclude (they got “x”):
- A, S, N, T

Positions that each of R, I, E are **forbidden**:
- R: cannot be in position 1 (guess 1) or position 4 (guess 2)
- I: cannot be in position 3 (guess 1) or position 1 (guess 2)
- E: cannot be in position 5 (guess 1) or position 3 (guess 2)

So allowed positions:
- R: 2, 3, 5
- I: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need a 5-letter word that contains R, I, E, uses none of A, S, N, T, and places each of R, I, E in one of their allowed positions.

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit:
- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 4, “E” in position 1 gives us the pattern E _ R I _ → but we don’t have a word like that.

- “R” in position 3, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 2 gives _ E _ R I → leads to “BERIO”? Not valid.

- “R” in position 2, “I” in position 5, “E” in position 1 gives E _ R _ I → leads to “EERIE” (invalid repeats).

- “CRIER” – has T (forbidden) and a double R – not ideal.

- “REBID” – no T, no A, no S, no N; it has R, E, I:
  – R is pos 1 → forbidden for R – discard.

- “FRIED” – has a T? No, but has F, R, I, E, D.
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden (from guess 1) – discard.

- “PRICE” – contains C and P, no forbidden letters.
  – P R I C E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “BRIDE” – B R I D E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “DIRGE” – D I R G E
  – I pos 2 – allowed
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – E pos 5 – forbidden – discard.

- “DRIER” – contains a second R and an extra E; also positions of R conflict.

- “GRIPE” – G R I P E
  – R pos 2 – allowed
  – I pos 3 – forbidden – discard.

- “RIDGE” – R pos 1 – forbidden.

- “PERIL” – has an L we haven’t ruled out, but no T, A, S, N.
  – P E R I L
  – R pos 3 – allowed
  – I pos 4 – allowed
  – E pos 2 – allowed
  – uses only allowed letters P, E, R, I, L.
  – fits every constraint.

Therefore “PERIL” is the best next candidate.

Guess 3: PERIL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds we now have:

Mandatory letters (all three guesses say “-” for them):
- R, I, E

Forbidden letters (got “x” in any guess):
- A, S, N, T, P, L

Forbidden positions for the mandatory letters:
- R: cannot be 1 (guess 1), 4 (guess 2), 3 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- I: cannot be 3 (guess 1), 1 (guess 2), 4 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 2, 5
- E: cannot be 5 (guess 1), 3 (guess 2), 2 (guess 3)  ⇒ allowed positions: 1, 4

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. contains R, I, E (exactly once each),
2. uses none of A, S, N, T, P, L,
3. places R only in positions 2 or 5,
4. places I only in positions 2 or 5,
5. places E only in positions 1 or 4.

The remaining letters free to use (common English, not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must choose two additional distinct letters from this set to fill the two remaining slots.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Pattern: E _ _ _ _  
Then R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Possible sub-cases:  
- E R _ _ I → need two middle letters, but only one slot is open; impossible.  
- E I _ _ R → same, impossible.  
So E cannot be in position 1.

Case 2: E in position 4  
Pattern: _ _ _ E _  
R and I must be placed in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).  
Sub-cases:

a) R in 2, I in 5 → _ R _ E I  
   The third letter (position 3) must be from the allowed list and distinct.  
   Candidate: C R O E I? No; must be a real word.  
   Real word: C R O W E is 6 letters.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Contains D (allowed) and no forbidden letters, but I would be in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I E F? I in 3, forbidden.  
   Real word: G R I E F? Same.  
   Real word: B R O K E? Doesn’t contain I.  
   Real word: C R I M E? Contains M, but C, R, I, M, E – positions: C(1) R(2) I(3) M(4) E(5)?  I in 3 is forbidden.  
   Real word: M E R I T? T is forbidden.  
   Real word: D R I V E? V is allowed, positions: D(1) R(2) I(3) V(4) E(5) – I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: F R I E D? Already seen.  
   Real word: W R I T E? T forbidden.  
   Real word: B R I D E? D is allowed, letters B, R, I, D, E – but I in 3 forbidden.  
   Real word: C R E D I? Not a word.

b) I in 2, R in 5 → _ I _ E R  
   Need first and third letters from allowed set.  
   Real word: C I D E R? letters C, I, D, E, R – positions: C(1) I(2) D(3) E(4) R(5)  
   Check constraints:  
     - R is in 5 – allowed.  
     - I is in 2 – allowed.  
     - E is in 4 – allowed.  
     - All letters OK (no A,S,N,T,P,L).  
   This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “CIDER”.

- C – not in word

- D – not in word  
- E – is in the word **and in the correct position (4)**  
- R – is in the word **and in the correct position (5)**

So we now know the exact pattern:

_ _ I E R

Letters already ruled out (appeared as ✗ at least once):  
A, C, D, L, N, P, S, T

Letters still available (besides the fixed I, E, R):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ _ I E R.  
Common candidates:  
- B I E R → “BIER” (4 letters)  
- F I E R → “FIER” (not a standalone word)  
- G I E R → “GIER” (rare)  
- H I E R → “HIER” (German)  
- K I E R → “KIER” (a dictionary word)  
- M I E R → “MIER” (proper noun)  
- V I E R → “VIER” (South African English)  
- W I E R → “WIER” (archaic spelling of “weir”)  

Among these, **KIER** is listed in standard English dictionaries and is the most straightforward.

Therefore the next guess is KIER.

(Note: If KIER is rejected by the game as non-acceptable, the next fallback would be VIER, then WIER; but KIER is the most common.)

positions 3-4-5 are fixed as I E R, so we need a five-letter word of the form **X Y I E R**.

Valid 5-letter words fitting exactly:

Valid pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Scanning the dictionary for five-letter words ending “IER” with no A, C, D, L, N, P, S, T:
- B I E R → too short  
- F I E R → too short  
- G I E R → too short  
- H I E R → too short  
- J I E R → too short  
- K I E R → too short  
- M I E R → too short  
- O I E R → not a word  
- Q U I E R → “QUIER” not standard  
- V I E R → too short  
- W I E R → too short  
- X I E R → non-word  
- Y I E R → non-word  
- Z I E R → non-word  

None of the single-letter prefixes give a standard 5-letter word ending in “IER”.

But we need **two** letters before “IER”, i.e., the pattern is
? ? I E R

Valid 5-letter words fitting exactly:
- BRIER → contains R in position 5 (fixed), I in 3, E in 4, B and R for the first two letters  
  – B R I E R  
  – check constraints:  
      - B not yet ruled out  
      - R is allowed in position 5 (indeed fixed)  
      - no forbidden letters (A,C,D,L,N,P,S,T)  
  – “BRIER” is a valid English word.

Hence the next guess is BRIER.",Guess 6: BRIER -> FEEDBACK: B(-) R(-) I(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
