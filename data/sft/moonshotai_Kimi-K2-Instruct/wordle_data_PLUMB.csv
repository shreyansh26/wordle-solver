2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that efficiently covers common letters in the English language. The most effective first guesses typically include:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)

A popular and strategic opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

The feedback for AROSE tells us that none of its five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means:

- The word has no A, R, O, S, or E.  
- We need a completely different set of letters for the next guess.

Good letters to test next are the remaining high-frequency consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, U).  
A balanced, strong second guess that avoids the five ruled-out letters and still covers several common letters is “UNTIL”.

- U – another vowel that wasn’t in AROSE  
- N, T, I, L – common consonants plus the vowel I

This should give us more information while avoiding the letters we now know are absent.

- N, T, I are not in the word at all.
- L is in the word, but not in position 5.

Known so far:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I
- Letters definitely present: U and L
- U is not in position 1, L is not in position 5.

That leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels Y (sometimes a vowel) and the remaining vowels are all ruled out except U.

- Does not contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I in any position.
- U cannot be in position 1.
- L cannot be in position 5.

- GULCH: G, U, L, C, H → also valid, but C and H are less common.

From all previous feedback we now know:

Absent letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, K, Y  
Present letters (must appear somewhere): U, L, B  
Forbidden positions:  
- U cannot be in positions 1 or 2  
- L cannot be in positions 3 or 5  
- B cannot be in position 1  

We still need the remaining two slots.  
Available, untested letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We must place:
- B, U, L exactly once each  
- two more distinct letters from the allowed set  
- satisfy the positional restrictions

Quick enumeration of valid patterns:

Pos 1: not B, not any forbidden. Good choices: C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Pos 2: cannot be U (already ruled out for pos 2), so any of the above or L if it fits  
Pos 3: cannot be L  
Pos 4: free (but L could go here)  
Pos 5: cannot be L or Y (Y already absent anyway)

Let’s pick a word that puts L in position 4 (legal), U in position 3 (legal), B somewhere, and two new consonants elsewhere.

Candidate: CLUBS – but S is banned.  
FLUB? – only 4 letters.  
PLUMB – P, L, U, M, B  
Check letters: P, L, U, M, B – none are in the banned list.  
Check positions:  
- P (pos 1) – OK  
- L (pos 2) – OK  
- U (pos 3) – OK  
- M (pos 4) – OK  
- B (pos 5) – OK (B not forbidden in pos 5)  

PLUMB satisfies every constraint.
