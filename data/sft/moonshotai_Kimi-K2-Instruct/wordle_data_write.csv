### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to start eliminating possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE we know:

- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word and is in the correct 4th position (✓)
- E is in the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ T E

Letters known to be absent: S, L, A

We still need information about the first three positions. Good letters to try now are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place T and E in their now-known correct positions
2. Use other letters that haven't been tested to gather information
3. Avoid S, L, A

Possible candidates: ROUTE, CHUTE, MUTED, QUIET, etc.

I'll choose ""CHUTE"" because:
- It keeps T and E in their confirmed positions
- Tests C, H, U - all new letters that haven't been tested yet
- Common word

We need a word that ends in ‑TE and uses three different, still-allowed letters in spots 1-2-3.  
Good next letters to test: R, N, I, O, D, G, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- WRITE – tests W, R, I  
- PRIME – but that ends in ‑ME, not ‑TE  
- BRITE – but B and R are fine, I is fine  
- GRATE – G, R, A – but A was already ruled out  
- MOUNT – ends in ‑NT  
- FRITE – not common
