- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, making it likely to hit at least one correct letter early on.

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the secret word.
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (it appeared in position 4 of CRANE, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 in the secret word).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter N (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

Good next-step candidates often include the remaining high-frequency consonants such as T, L, S, D, M, P, and vowels O, I, U.  
Let’s try a word that satisfies the constraints: “POINT”.
- P, O, I, N, T.
- N is in position 4 of POINT, so that’s allowed (since in CRANE it was position 4 and now it’s allowed to be anywhere except 4).
- None of C, R, A, E appear.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word: C, R, A, E, P, T.  
2. Letters that **are** in the word (in some position): N, O, I.  
   • N is present but **not** in position 4 or 5 (it was position 4 in CRANE and 4 in POINT and both times got “-”).  
   • O and I are confirmed present, but we still don’t know their correct positions.  

So our new guess must:
- Use only letters from {N, O, I} plus any other letters **not yet ruled out** (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Place N somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Take advantage of the confirmed O and I.

A good candidate is “JOIN” — but that’s only four letters.  
We need a 5-letter word that includes N, O, I and keeps N in spots 1-3.  
Let’s try “NIXON”:
- Contains N, I, O.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Uses X (not yet ruled out).

But it repeats N, which might waste info.  
A cleaner word is “IONIC” but C is already ruled out.  
Another option is “DONKI” — but K is rare.  
Let’s pick “NOISY”:
- N (1), O (2), I (3), S (4), Y (5).  
- Uses S and Y which haven’t been ruled out.  
- N is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Gives fresh info on S and Y.

So the next guess is “NOISY”.
