1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is my first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains commonly used letters in English to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters while avoiding repeats to test as many letters as possible. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a great starting word because it contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

From the first feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).

So the secret word:
- Contains both R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, I, or S.

We next want a word that:
- Keeps R and E but moves them to new, untested positions.
- Avoids A, I, S.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, Y.

Possible candidate: ""TREND""
- T: common, untested.
- R: now in position 2 (was position 1 before).
- E: now in position 3 (was position 5 before).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters while avoiding repeats to test as many letters as possible. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a great starting word because it contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).

So the secret word:
- Contains both R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, I, or S.

We next want a word that:
- Keeps R and E but moves them to new, untested positions.
- Avoids A, I, S.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, Y.
Let’s build a word with R and E in new slots. Try putting R in position 2 and E in position 3.

Possible candidate: ""TREND""
- T: common, untested.
- R: now in position 2 (was position 1 before).
- E: now in position 3 (was position 5 before).
- N, D: common, untested.

No A, I, or S are used, satisfying the feedback.

So E must be in position 2 or 4.

Letters we know are **not** in the word: A, I, S, T, N, D.

Common unused letters: O, U, L, C, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, P, W.

We want a new word that:
- Places R in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Places E in positions 2 or 4.
- Uses only letters **not** yet eliminated.

Let’s try R in position 4 and E in position 2.

- C: untested.

Current confirmed pattern and constraints:

1. Positions 2, 3, 5 are locked: _ E R _ Y
2. Letters used (and therefore excluded from positions 1 and 4):  
   A, C, D, F, I, L, M, N, O, S, T
3. Additional rule: B is in the word but NOT in position 1 (feedback B(-)).

So B must appear in position 4; no other letter can go there because:
- Position 4 has never received ✓ or x before, so any unused letter could go there.  
- But B is now known to be present and the only spot left for it is position 4.

Therefore the secret word is unambiguous: B E R B Y.  
Since BERBY is the only 5-letter English word fitting these constraints, that must be the solution.
