Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. I want to include vowels (especially E, A, O) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).

Some popular first guesses in Wordle are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters and covers the most frequent consonants and vowels in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-) – specifically, not in the 5th position.

That means:
1. We must avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
2. The word must contain **E**, but **not as the last letter**.
3. The remaining letters to consider are common ones like R, N, I, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

I want a word that:
- Has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""NERDY"":
- Contains E in the 2nd position (testing a new spot).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Uses N, R, D, Y – all common and distinct.

From Guess 2 (NERDY) we now know:

- N is not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the exact 2nd position (✓).
- R is in the exact 3rd position (✓).
- D is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).  
- Y is in the exact 5th position (✓).

So the word looks like: _ E R _ Y  
and it must also contain D somewhere, but NOT in position 4.

Letters we must still avoid: S, L, A, T, N  
Letters we know are in the word: E, R, D, Y (positions fixed except D)  

The missing letters are positions 1 and 4.  
Position 4 can’t be D (because D is somewhere else), so D must be in position 1 or already in position 1.

Let’s test D in position 1: D E R _ Y → we need a 4th letter that isn’t any of the eliminated ones (S, L, A, T, N) and keeps the word valid.

Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U (since E is already used).

Try putting I in position 4: D E R I Y. Is that a valid word? Yes, “DERIY” isn’t, but “DERRY” or “PERKY”?

“PERKY” fits:
- Meets known letters: P (1st), E (2nd), R (3rd), Y (5th).  
- Doesn’t use any eliminated letters.  
- D must still be in the word but hasn’t been placed. Wait, we haven’t placed D yet.

We need to place D. Since we know D must be present but wasn’t in position 4 (and PERKY doesn’t have D), this word won’t work.

Alternative: place D in position 1. So D E R _ Y. The missing 4th letter should be a vowel or consonant not yet used.

Common choice: D E R R Y (but R is already in position 3 and can’t repeat?). Actually, letters can repeat in Wordle. DERRY is a valid word.

Let’s try DERRY.

But wait: we already have Y in position 5, and DERRY uses R twice. That’s allowed.

But another valid word: M E R R Y. That uses M (valid), E at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5. Still no D.

We must use D. So best is D E R _ Y. Possible: D E R V Y (but not a word), D E R B Y → “DERBY” – valid and includes D in position 1.

DERBY:
- D in 1st (satisfies D must be present).
- E in 2nd (✓).
- R in 3rd (✓).
- B in 4th (new letter, not eliminated).
- Y in 5th (✓).

No conflicts and uses D. DERBY is a valid guess.
