For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The best starting words typically include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and gather useful information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE we know:
- S is correct in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are all absent from the word.

So the unknown positions (2-5) can use any letters except L, A, T, E.  
We still need to cover the remaining vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, etc.).  
A good next word to test several new letters while keeping S fixed is “SIRUP” (or “SPORT” if we prefer to test R, O, P together).  
Both avoid the eliminated letters and include fresh common letters.  
I’ll pick “SIRUP” because it introduces the remaining vowels I and U plus the consonant R and P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The best starting words typically include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and gather useful information for subsequent guesses.

We still need to cover the remaining vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, etc.).

Current known facts:

Pattern: S _ O _ P   (positions 1-3-5 locked)

Letters **not** in the word (eliminated):
L, A, T, E, I, R, U, C, M, N

Letters whose status is only “wrong position”:
W (from SNOWP) – it appears in the word but not at position 4.

Thus the two blanks (positions 2 and 4) must be filled only from letters **not yet eliminated** and not conflicting with W’s placement.

Available letters (common ones in priority order):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since W must appear somewhere, and the only open slot for W is position 2 (because it can’t be at 4), let’s place it there first.

That leaves position 4. The remaining unused consonant that is common enough and hasn’t been tested is D, G, H, K, etc.

Try the word S W O _ P with each candidate:

- SWODP – not valid  
- SWOGP – not valid  
- SWOHP – not valid  
- SWOKP – not valid  

But we must form a valid English five-letter word.  
Let’s list valid **S W O _ P** words:

“SWOOP” – valid and common.  
“SWOP”  – four letters, too short.  
“SWOUP” – invalid (U already out).  

“SWOOP” is the only real candidate.  
Check constraints:
- S, O, P already confirmed in positions 1,3,5  
- W is allowed in position 2 because we know W exists but isn’t at position 4  
- The second O (position 4) is allowed (O is confirmed in the word), and it hasn’t been eliminated from that slot.

Thus the two blanks (positions 2 and 4) must be filled only from letters **not yet eliminated** and not conflicting with W’s placement.

Available letters (common ones in priority order):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since W must appear somewhere, and the only open slot for W is position 2 (because it can’t be at 4), let’s place it there first.

That leaves position 4. The remaining unused consonant that is common enough and hasn’t been tested is D, G, H, K, etc.

Try the word S W O _ P with each candidate:

- SWODP – not valid  
- SWOGP – not valid  
- SWOHP – not valid  
- SWOKP – not valid  

But we must form a valid English five-letter word.  
Let’s list valid **S W O _ P** words:

“SWOOP” – valid and common.  
“SWOP”  – four letters, too short.  
“SWOUP” – invalid (U already out).  

“SWOOP” is the only real candidate.  
Check constraints:
- S, O, P already confirmed in positions 1,3,5  
- W is allowed in position 2 because we know W exists but isn’t at position 4  
- The second O (position 4) is allowed (O is confirmed in the word), and it hasn’t been eliminated from that slot.

Therefore the next logical guess is:

<guess>SWOOP</guess>",Guess 5: SWOOP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(✓) O(✓) O(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
