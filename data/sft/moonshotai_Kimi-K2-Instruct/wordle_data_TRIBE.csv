For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can provide good feedback. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at potential 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us a strong starting position to gather information about which vowels and consonants might be present in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- R is correct and in position 2.
- E is correct and in position 5.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ E and we know A, O, S are excluded.

Common letters left to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, etc.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has E in position 5
3. Doesn't contain A, O, or S
4. Uses new letters to gather more info

Possible candidates: BRIBE (but has B twice), TRICE (but has C), DRIFT (but has F), etc.

""TRIBE"" seems good because:
- T, I, B are new letters
- Fits the pattern _ R _ _ E
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (A,O,S)

Let's go with TRIBE.
