For the first guess, I want to choose a word that provides maximum information by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, N, I, S, H, R. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  (with constraints that R ≠ 1, E ≠ 5, no S or I).

To maximize new information, I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. The remaining common letters include T, N, L, O, C, H, D, U, P, M, B, G.

Since A is locked in position 2, I’ll look for a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) to test R’s location.
- Uses E in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test E’s location.
- Introduces new common letters like T, N, L, O, etc.

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is in position 1 (new position; checks if E can be first).
- R is in position 3 (new position; checks if R can be third).
- Introduces new letters L and Y (Y is less common, but L is good to test).
However, Y is not among the most common letters, and we might want to test more frequent consonants first.

Another candidate is “EARNT”:
- A is in position 2.
- E is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- N and T are both very common and new to test.
This seems better.

Alternatively, “EARNS” would be good, but S is already ruled out.

So “EARNT” is a strong next guess.

Wait—let me double-check: EARNT is a valid word, though less common. A better common word is “EARLY” (but Y is less useful). Alternatively, “CARTE” has A in position 2, but C and T are new, and E is in position 5 (which was ruled out). Not ideal.

Another option: “PARTY” – but A is in position 2, P is new, R is in position 3 (allowed), T is new, Y is less useful. But E hasn’t been placed yet.

I think “EARNT” is the best balance, even if slightly less common. Alternatively, “EARLY” is acceptable. But let me find a more common word.

“LARGE”:
- A in position 2 (matches).
- R in position 3 (new position).
- E in position 5 (was ruled out by feedback: E is not in position 5). So this is invalid.

“BARGE”:
- Same issue, E in position 5.

“CABLE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“DANCE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“RAVEN”:
- A in position 2.
- R in position 1 (invalid; R cannot be in position 1).
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“WAGER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CATER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“PAPER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“LAYER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CARER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Hmm, many common words with A in position 2 end with E in position 5, which is ruled out. So I need a word with A in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Good candidates:
- “MARCH”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3 (new position).
  - E is not included, so we’d miss testing E’s position, but we still need to place E somewhere.
  - Not ideal.

- “BARON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3.
  - E is not included.

- “RACON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 1 (invalid).

- “EARLY”:
  - E in position 1 (new).
  - A in position 2 (correct).
  - R in position 3 (new).
  - L and Y are new letters.
  - This seems the best so far, even if Y isn’t the most common.

“EARLY” fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- R is not in position 1 (it’s in position 3).
- Introduces new letters L and Y.

I’ll go with “EARLY”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,cater,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that provides maximum information by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, N, I, S, H, R. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  (with constraints that R ≠ 1, E ≠ 5, no S or I).

To maximize new information, I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. The remaining common letters include T, N, L, O, C, H, D, U, P, M, B, G.

Since A is locked in position 2, I’ll look for a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) to test R’s location.
- Uses E in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test E’s location.
- Introduces new common letters like T, N, L, O, etc.

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is in position 1 (new position; checks if E can be first).
- R is in position 3 (new position; checks if R can be third).
- Introduces new letters L and Y (Y is less common, but L is good to test).
However, Y is not among the most common letters, and we might want to test more frequent consonants first.

Another candidate is “EARNT”:
- A is in position 2.
- E is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- N and T are both very common and new to test.
This seems better.

Alternatively, “EARNS” would be good, but S is already ruled out.

So “EARNT” is a strong next guess.

Wait—let me double-check: EARNT is a valid word, though less common. A better common word is “EARLY” (but Y is less useful). Alternatively, “CARTE” has A in position 2, but C and T are new, and E is in position 5 (which was ruled out). Not ideal.

Another option: “PARTY” – but A is in position 2, P is new, R is in position 3 (allowed), T is new, Y is less useful. But E hasn’t been placed yet.

I think “EARNT” is the best balance, even if slightly less common. Alternatively, “EARLY” is acceptable. But let me find a more common word.

“LARGE”:
- A in position 2 (matches).
- R in position 3 (new position).
- E in position 5 (was ruled out by feedback: E is not in position 5). So this is invalid.

“BARGE”:
- Same issue, E in position 5.

“CABLE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“DANCE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“RAVEN”:
- A in position 2.
- R in position 1 (invalid; R cannot be in position 1).
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“WAGER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CATER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“PAPER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“LAYER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CARER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Hmm, many common words with A in position 2 end with E in position 5, which is ruled out. So I need a word with A in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Good candidates:
- “MARCH”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3 (new position).
  - E is not included, so we’d miss testing E’s position, but we still need to place E somewhere.
  - Not ideal.

- “BARON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3.
  - E is not included.

- “RACON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 1 (invalid).

- “EARLY”:
  - E in position 1 (new).
  - A in position 2 (correct).
  - R in position 3 (new).
  - L and Y are new letters.
  - This seems the best so far, even if Y isn’t the most common.

“EARLY” fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- R is not in position 1 (it’s in position 3).
- Introduces new letters L and Y.

I’ll go with “EARLY”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that provides maximum information by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, N, I, S, H, R. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  (with constraints that R ≠ 1, E ≠ 5, no S or I).

To maximize new information, I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. The remaining common letters include T, N, L, O, C, H, D, U, P, M, B, G.

Since A is locked in position 2, I’ll look for a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) to test R’s location.
- Uses E in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test E’s location.
- Introduces new common letters like T, N, L, O, etc.

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is in position 1 (new position; checks if E can be first).
- R is in position 3 (new position; checks if R can be third).
- Introduces new letters L and Y (Y is less common, but L is good to test).
However, Y is not among the most common letters, and we might want to test more frequent consonants first.

Another candidate is “EARNT”:
- A is in position 2.
- E is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- N and T are both very common and new to test.
This seems better.

Alternatively, “EARNS” would be good, but S is already ruled out.

So “EARNT” is a strong next guess.

Wait—let me double-check: EARNT is a valid word, though less common. A better common word is “EARLY” (but Y is less useful). Alternatively, “CARTE” has A in position 2, but C and T are new, and E is in position 5 (which was ruled out). Not ideal.

Another option: “PARTY” – but A is in position 2, P is new, R is in position 3 (allowed), T is new, Y is less useful. But E hasn’t been placed yet.

I think “EARNT” is the best balance, even if slightly less common. Alternatively, “EARLY” is acceptable. But let me find a more common word.

“LARGE”:
- A in position 2 (matches).
- R in position 3 (new position).
- E in position 5 (was ruled out by feedback: E is not in position 5). So this is invalid.

“BARGE”:
- Same issue, E in position 5.

“CABLE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“DANCE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“RAVEN”:
- A in position 2.
- R in position 1 (invalid; R cannot be in position 1).
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“WAGER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CATER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“PAPER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“LAYER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CARER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Hmm, many common words with A in position 2 end with E in position 5, which is ruled out. So I need a word with A in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Good candidates:
- “MARCH”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3 (new position).
  - E is not included, so we’d miss testing E’s position, but we still need to place E somewhere.
  - Not ideal.

- “BARON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3.
  - E is not included.

- “RACON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 1 (invalid).

- “EARLY”:
  - E in position 1 (new).
  - A in position 2 (correct).
  - R in position 3 (new).
  - L and Y are new letters.
  - This seems the best so far, even if Y isn’t the most common.

“EARLY” fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- R is not in position 1 (it’s in position 3).
- Introduces new letters L and Y.

I’ll go with “EARLY”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - R is present but not in position 1.
   - E is present but not in position 5.
   - I, S are absent.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - E is present but not in position 1.
   - R is present but not in position 3.
   - L, Y are absent.

Combining them:
- A is locked in position 2.
- Word contains R and E but:
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: I, S, L, Y.

The remaining common letters: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, O, H, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a word of the form: _ A _ _ _
with E and R somewhere in the remaining three slots, and no I, S, L, Y, and satisfying the positional bans.

Possible positions for R: positions 2, 4, 5.  
But A is in 2, so R can be in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for E: positions 2, 3, 4.  
A is in 2, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Let’s list valid patterns:

Case 1: R in 4
   Then E must be in 3 or 5, but 5 is banned for E, so E in 3.
   Pattern: _ A E R _

Case 2: R in 5
   Then E can be in 3 or 4.
   Sub-cases:
   a) _ A E _ R
   b) _ A _ E R (but then R is in 5 – allowed)

We can now pick a common word fitting one of these patterns and using the remaining allowed letters.

From Case 1: _ A E R _
Possible letters: consonants left: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, etc.
Try “C A E R _” → “CAERN” – not a word.
Try “M A E R _” → “MAERO” – not in standard dictionary.
Try “T A E R N” – “TAERN” – no.
Real word: “TAERN” is not common; the valid common English word is “TAE” (3 letters). Instead, “CAERN” doesn’t exist. Let’s look for real words.

Real word fitting _ A E R _ : None common.

Case 2a: _ A E _ R
Real word candidates:
- “BAE KR” – no.
- “C A E D R” – “CAEDR” – no.
- “P A E R R” – “PAERR” – no.
- “D A E R R” – “DAERR” – no.
- “T A E D R” – “TAEDR” – no.

Case 2b: _ A _ E R
Now R is in 5, E in 4, A in 2, so pattern: _ A _ E R

We need a consonant for positions 1 and 3, avoiding I, S, L, Y, and using letters not yet tested.

Popular choices left: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, O, H, K, etc.

Examples:
- “C A M E R” – “CAMER” – not standard.
- “C A N E R” – “CANER” – valid (one who canes).
- “G A M E R” – “GAMER” – valid.
- “P A P E R” – but P and P, and R in 5 – valid.
- “B A N E R” – “BANER” – not standard.
- “T A P E R” – “TAPER” – valid.
- “W A T E R” – but W hasn’t been used, and pattern fits.

Among these, the most common word is “TAPER”.

Check constraints for “TAPER”:
- A in position 2 – matches.
- E in position 4 – allowed (not 1 or 5).
- R in position 5 – allowed (not 1 or 3).
- No I, S, L, Y.
- Uses new letters T, P.

Therefore, “TAPER” is a good third guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that provides maximum information by using common letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, N, I, S, H, R. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  (with constraints that R ≠ 1, E ≠ 5, no S or I).

To maximize new information, I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. The remaining common letters include T, N, L, O, C, H, D, U, P, M, B, G.

Since A is locked in position 2, I’ll look for a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) to test R’s location.
- Uses E in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test E’s location.
- Introduces new common letters like T, N, L, O, etc.

A good candidate is “EARLY”:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is in position 1 (new position; checks if E can be first).
- R is in position 3 (new position; checks if R can be third).
- Introduces new letters L and Y (Y is less common, but L is good to test).
However, Y is not among the most common letters, and we might want to test more frequent consonants first.

Another candidate is “EARNT”:
- A is in position 2.
- E is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- N and T are both very common and new to test.
This seems better.

Alternatively, “EARNS” would be good, but S is already ruled out.

So “EARNT” is a strong next guess.

Wait—let me double-check: EARNT is a valid word, though less common. A better common word is “EARLY” (but Y is less useful). Alternatively, “CARTE” has A in position 2, but C and T are new, and E is in position 5 (which was ruled out). Not ideal.

Another option: “PARTY” – but A is in position 2, P is new, R is in position 3 (allowed), T is new, Y is less useful. But E hasn’t been placed yet.

I think “EARNT” is the best balance, even if slightly less common. Alternatively, “EARLY” is acceptable. But let me find a more common word.

“LARGE”:
- A in position 2 (matches).
- R in position 3 (new position).
- E in position 5 (was ruled out by feedback: E is not in position 5). So this is invalid.

“BARGE”:
- Same issue, E in position 5.

“CABLE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“DANCE”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“RAVEN”:
- A in position 2.
- R in position 1 (invalid; R cannot be in position 1).
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“WAGER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CATER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“PAPER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“LAYER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

“CARER”:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Hmm, many common words with A in position 2 end with E in position 5, which is ruled out. So I need a word with A in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Good candidates:
- “MARCH”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3 (new position).
  - E is not included, so we’d miss testing E’s position, but we still need to place E somewhere.
  - Not ideal.

- “BARON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 3.
  - E is not included.

- “RACON”:
  - A in position 2.
  - R in position 1 (invalid).

- “EARLY”:
  - E in position 1 (new).
  - A in position 2 (correct).
  - R in position 3 (new).
  - L and Y are new letters.
  - This seems the best so far, even if Y isn’t the most common.

“EARLY” fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).
- E is not in position 5 (it’s in position 1).
- R is not in position 1 (it’s in position 3).
- Introduces new letters L and Y.

I’ll go with “EARLY”.

<guess>EARLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - R is present but not in position 1.
   - E is present but not in position 5.
   - I, S are absent.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - E is present but not in position 1.
   - R is present but not in position 3.
   - L, Y are absent.

Combining them:
- A is locked in position 2.
- Word contains R and E but:
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: I, S, L, Y.

The remaining common letters: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, O, H, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a word of the form: _ A _ _ _
with E and R somewhere in the remaining three slots, and no I, S, L, Y, and satisfying the positional bans.

Possible positions for R: positions 2, 4, 5.  
But A is in 2, so R can be in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for E: positions 2, 3, 4.  
A is in 2, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Let’s list valid patterns:

Case 1: R in 4
   Then E must be in 3 or 5, but 5 is banned for E, so E in 3.
   Pattern: _ A E R _

Case 2: R in 5
   Then E can be in 3 or 4.
   Sub-cases:
   a) _ A E _ R
   b) _ A _ E R (but then R is in 5 – allowed)

We can now pick a common word fitting one of these patterns and using the remaining allowed letters.

From Case 1: _ A E R _
Possible letters: consonants left: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, etc.
Try “C A E R _” → “CAERN” – not a word.
Try “M A E R _” → “MAERO” – not in standard dictionary.
Try “T A E R N” – “TAERN” – no.
Real word: “TAERN” is not common; the valid common English word is “TAE” (3 letters). Instead, “CAERN” doesn’t exist. Let’s look for real words.

Real word fitting _ A E R _ : None common.

Case 2a: _ A E _ R
Real word candidates:
- “BAE KR” – no.
- “C A E D R” – “CAEDR” – no.
- “P A E R R” – “PAERR” – no.
- “D A E R R” – “DAERR” – no.
- “T A E D R” – “TAEDR” – no.

Case 2b: _ A _ E R
Now R is in 5, E in 4, A in 2, so pattern: _ A _ E R

We need a consonant for positions 1 and 3, avoiding I, S, L, Y, and using letters not yet tested.

Popular choices left: T, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, U, O, H, K, etc.

Examples:
- “C A M E R” – “CAMER” – not standard.
- “C A N E R” – “CANER” – valid (one who canes).
- “G A M E R” – “GAMER” – valid.
- “P A P E R” – but P and P, and R in 5 – valid.
- “B A N E R” – “BANER” – not standard.
- “T A P E R” – “TAPER” – valid.
- “W A T E R” – but W hasn’t been used, and pattern fits.

Among these, the most common word is “TAPER”.

Check constraints for “TAPER”:
- A in position 2 – matches.
- E in position 4 – allowed (not 1 or 5).
- R in position 5 – allowed (not 1 or 3).
- No I, S, L, Y.
- Uses new letters T, P.

Therefore, “TAPER” is a good third guess.

The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, N, I, S, H, R. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.\n\nSome good starting words include:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many positions. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A is in the word and in position 2.\n- I is not in the word.\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  (with constraints that R ≠ 1, E ≠ 5, no S or I).\n\nTo maximize new information, I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used yet. The remaining common letters include T, N, L, O, C, H, D, U, P, M, B, G.\n\nSince A is locked in position 2, I’ll look for a word that:\n- Keeps A in position 2.\n- Uses R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) to test R’s location.\n- Uses E in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test E’s location.\n- Introduces new common letters like T, N, L, O, etc.\n\nA good candidate is “EARLY”:\n- A is in position 2 (matches feedback).\n- E is in position 1 (new position; checks if E can be first).\n- R is in position 3 (new position; checks if R can be third).\n- Introduces new letters L and Y (Y is less common, but L is good to test).\nHowever, Y is not among the most common letters, and we might want to test more frequent consonants first.\n\nAnother candidate is “EARNT”:\n- A is in position 2.\n- E is in position 1.\n- R is in position 3.\n- N and T are both very common and new to test.\nThis seems better.\n\nAlternatively, “EARNS” would be good, but S is already ruled out.\n\nSo “EARNT” is a strong next guess.\n\nWait—let me double-check: EARNT is a valid word, though less common. A better common word is “EARLY” (but Y is less useful). Alternatively, “CARTE” has A in position 2, but C and T are new, and E is in position 5 (which was ruled out). Not ideal.\n\nAnother option: “PARTY” – but A is in position 2, P is new, R is in position 3 (allowed), T is new, Y is less useful. But E hasn’t been placed yet.\n\nI think “EARNT” is the best balance, even if slightly less common. Alternatively, “EARLY” is acceptable. But let me find a more common word.\n\n“LARGE”:\n- A in position 2 (matches).\n- R in position 3 (new position).\n- E in position 5 (was ruled out by feedback: E is not in position 5). So this is invalid.\n\n“BARGE”:\n- Same issue, E in position 5.\n\n“CABLE”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“DANCE”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“RAVEN”:\n- A in position 2.\n- R in position 1 (invalid; R cannot be in position 1).\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“WAGER”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“CATER”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“PAPER”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“LAYER”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\n“CARER”:\n- A in position 2.\n- E in position 5 (invalid).\n\nHmm, many common words with A in position 2 end with E in position 5, which is ruled out.
