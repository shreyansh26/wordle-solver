For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the chance of finding letters in the secret word. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeated letters, giving us maximum coverage

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (shows up as “-”)
- R is in the word and in the correct second position (✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct third position (✓)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So the pattern we have is:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E

We still need to place the A (it can’t be first) and two more letters that aren’t S or E. Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.

A straightforward next probe is “TRAIN”:
- It keeps R and I locked in place.
- It places A in the fourth spot (allowed, since A can’t be first).
- It introduces T and N, two very common consonants.

So far we have:

Letters we know are in the word: A, I, R  
Positions locked:  
- R is in position 2  
- I is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN feedback) and NOT in position 3 (from ARISE it was position 3 and marked ✓, but TRAIN feedback showed I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position for position 4. So I is in word but NOT in position 3 or 4. Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

However, from ARISE: I was in position 3 and marked ✓. This means I is correctly in position 3, and TRAIN feedback shows A(-) meaning A is in word but not position 4, and I(-) in position 4 means I is in word but not position 4, but we already know I is correctly in position 3 from ARISE. This seems conflicting unless we misread.

Wait, re-reading:  
ARISE feedback: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
This means:  
- A is in word but not position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I is correct in position 3  
- S and E are not in word

TRAIN feedback: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)  
This means:  
- T not in word  
- R correct in position 2  
- A in word but not position 3  
- I in word but not position 4  
- N not in word

So combining:  
Known pattern: _ R I _ _  
Letters in word: A, R, I  
Letters not in word: S, E, T, N  
A cannot be position 1 (from ARISE) or 3 (from TRAIN), so A must be 4 or 5.  
I is correctly in position 3 (from ARISE), so TRAIN's I(-) in position 4 just confirms I is not there - consistent.

Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 4 and 5 if A is 5). Possible letters avoiding S,E,T,N. Good candidates: C, L, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try placing A in position 4: _ R I A _  
We need a letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining common consonants avoiding S,E,T,N. Good choices: C, L, D, M.

Let's try ""CRIAL"" but that's not a common word. ""DRIAM"" - no. Maybe ""BRIAR""? B is unused, R,I,A are placed, and R at end is ok. Actually BRIAR has R twice - no good. ""DRAIN"" - but N is excluded. ""GRAIL"" - G,R,A,I,L. L is unused. GRAIL has R twice. Not good.

Alternative: place A in position 5: _ R I _ A  
Then position 1 and 4. Good consonants: C, L, D, M, B, G.  
Let's try ""CRIMA"" - not a word. ""BRIMA"" - no. ""PRIMA"" - P is unused. PRIMA is valid. Or ""DRIDA"" - no. ""FRICA"" - F is unused. Let's try ""BRICA"" - no. 

""CRIMP"" - but P is unused, but we need A in word. ""FRAIL"" - but L is unused, A is position 4, but we have A must be in 4 or 5. Let me reconstruct:

Pattern: _ R I _ _  
A must be in 4 or 5.  
Letters available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S,E,T,N)

Let's try putting A in position 4: _ R I A _  
Then position 1 and 5: need two letters from remaining. Good first letters: B, C, D, F, G. Good fifth letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Let's pick ""FRIAR"" - but R is already in position 2, can't be in 5. ""PRIAM"" - but M is excluded. ""CRIED"" - E excluded. 

Better approach: use common structure. Try ""GRAIL"" - but R repeats. ""CRIKEY"" - too long. 

Let's try simple: ""FRISK"" - S excluded. ""DRILL"" - L repeats. 

Actually, let's try ""PRIMA"":
- P, R, I, M, A
- R in 2: ✓
- I in 3: ✓
- A in 5: allowed (A must be 4 or 5)
- P and M are new letters
- All letters are unique and from allowed set

But is PRIMA valid? Yes, it's a word (first, primary in Spanish/Italian). 

Alternative: ""BRISK"" - S excluded. ""GRIME"" - E excluded. ""CRIMP"" - no A. 

Another option: ""GRAIL"" - but R would be twice. 

Let's go with ""PRIMA"" as it fits all constraints.

- It introduces T and N, two very common consonants.

Let’s use TRAIN.

<guess>train</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Letters we know are in the word: A, I, R  
Positions locked:  
- R is in position 2  
- I is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN feedback) and NOT in position 3 (from ARISE it was position 3 and marked ✓, but TRAIN feedback showed I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position for position 4. So I is in word but NOT in position 3 or 4. Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

However, from ARISE: I was in position 3 and marked ✓. This means I is correctly in position 3, and TRAIN feedback shows A(-) meaning A is in word but not position 4, and I(-) in position 4 means I is in word but not position 4, but we already know I is correctly in position 3 from ARISE. This seems conflicting unless we misread.

Wait, re-reading:  
ARISE feedback: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
This means:  
- A is in word but not position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I is correct in position 3  
- S and E are not in word

TRAIN feedback: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)  
This means:  
- T not in word  
- R correct in position 2  
- A in word but not position 3  
- I in word but not position 4  
- N not in word

So combining:  
Known pattern: _ R I _ _  
Letters in word: A, R, I  
Letters not in word: S, E, T, N  
A cannot be position 1 (from ARISE) or 3 (from TRAIN), so A must be 4 or 5.  
I is correctly in position 3 (from ARISE), so TRAIN's I(-) in position 4 just confirms I is not there - consistent.

Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 4 and 5 if A is 5). Possible letters avoiding S,E,T,N. Good candidates: C, L, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try placing A in position 4: _ R I A _  
We need a letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining common consonants avoiding S,E,T,N. Good choices: C, L, D, M.

Let's try ""CRIAL"" but that's not a common word. ""DRIAM"" - no. Maybe ""BRIAR""? B is unused, R,I,A are placed, and R at end is ok. Actually BRIAR has R twice - no good. ""DRAIN"" - but N is excluded. ""GRAIL"" - G,R,A,I,L. L is unused. GRAIL has R twice. Not good.

Alternative: place A in position 5: _ R I _ A  
Then position 1 and 4. Good consonants: C, L, D, M, B, G.  
Let's try ""CRIMA"" - not a word. ""BRIMA"" - no. ""PRIMA"" - P is unused. PRIMA is valid. Or ""DRIDA"" - no. ""FRICA"" - F is unused. Let's try ""BRICA"" - no. 

""CRIMP"" - but P is unused, but we need A in word. ""FRAIL"" - but L is unused, A is position 4, but we have A must be in 4 or 5. Let me reconstruct:

Pattern: _ R I _ _  
A must be in 4 or 5.  
Letters available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S,E,T,N)

Let's try putting A in position 4: _ R I A _  
Then position 1 and 5: need two letters from remaining. Good first letters: B, C, D, F, G. Good fifth letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Let's pick ""FRIAR"" - but R is already in position 2, can't be in 5. ""PRIAM"" - but M is excluded. ""CRIED"" - E excluded. 

Better approach: use common structure. Try ""GRAIL"" - but R repeats. ""CRIKEY"" - too long. 

Let's try simple: ""FRISK"" - S excluded. ""DRILL"" - L repeats. 

Actually, let's try ""PRIMA"":
- P, R, I, M, A
- R in 2: ✓
- I in 3: ✓
- A in 5: allowed (A must be 4 or 5)
- P and M are new letters
- All letters are unique and from allowed set

But is PRIMA valid? Yes, it's a word (first, primary in Spanish/Italian). 

Alternative: ""BRISK"" - S excluded. ""GRIME"" - E excluded. ""CRIMP"" - no A. 

Another option: ""GRAIL"" - but R would be twice. 

Let's go with ""PRIMA"" as it fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeated letters, giving us maximum coverage

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,briar,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the chance of finding letters in the secret word. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- No repeated letters, giving us maximum coverage

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>arise</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (shows up as “-”)
- R is in the word and in the correct second position (✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct third position (✓)
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So the pattern we have is:
_ R I _ _

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E

We still need to place the A (it can’t be first) and two more letters that aren’t S or E. Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.

A straightforward next probe is “TRAIN”:
- It keeps R and I locked in place.
- It places A in the fourth spot (allowed, since A can’t be first).
- It introduces T and N, two very common consonants.

Let’s use TRAIN.

<guess>train</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Letters we know are in the word: A, I, R  
Positions locked:  
- R is in position 2  
- I is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN feedback) and NOT in position 3 (from ARISE it was position 3 and marked ✓, but TRAIN feedback showed I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position for position 4. So I is in word but NOT in position 3 or 4. Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

However, from ARISE: I was in position 3 and marked ✓. This means I is correctly in position 3, and TRAIN feedback shows A(-) meaning A is in word but not position 4, and I(-) in position 4 means I is in word but not position 4, but we already know I is correctly in position 3 from ARISE. This seems conflicting unless we misread.

Wait, re-reading:  
ARISE feedback: A(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
This means:  
- A is in word but not position 1  
- R is correct in position 2  
- I is correct in position 3  
- S and E are not in word

TRAIN feedback: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)  
This means:  
- T not in word  
- R correct in position 2  
- A in word but not position 3  
- I in word but not position 4  
- N not in word

So combining:  
Known pattern: _ R I _ _  
Letters in word: A, R, I  
Letters not in word: S, E, T, N  
A cannot be position 1 (from ARISE) or 3 (from TRAIN), so A must be 4 or 5.  
I is correctly in position 3 (from ARISE), so TRAIN's I(-) in position 4 just confirms I is not there - consistent.

Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 4 and 5 if A is 5). Possible letters avoiding S,E,T,N. Good candidates: C, L, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try placing A in position 4: _ R I A _  
We need a letter for position 1 and 5 from remaining common consonants avoiding S,E,T,N. Good choices: C, L, D, M.

Let's try ""CRIAL"" but that's not a common word. ""DRIAM"" - no. Maybe ""BRIAR""? B is unused, R,I,A are placed, and R at end is ok. Actually BRIAR has R twice - no good. ""DRAIN"" - but N is excluded. ""GRAIL"" - G,R,A,I,L. L is unused. GRAIL has R twice. Not good.

Alternative: place A in position 5: _ R I _ A  
Then position 1 and 4. Good consonants: C, L, D, M, B, G.  
Let's try ""CRIMA"" - not a word. ""BRIMA"" - no. ""PRIMA"" - P is unused. PRIMA is valid. Or ""DRIDA"" - no. ""FRICA"" - F is unused. Let's try ""BRICA"" - no. 

""CRIMP"" - but P is unused, but we need A in word. ""FRAIL"" - but L is unused, A is position 4, but we have A must be in 4 or 5. Let me reconstruct:

Pattern: _ R I _ _  
A must be in 4 or 5.  
Letters available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S,E,T,N)

Let's try putting A in position 4: _ R I A _  
Then position 1 and 5: need two letters from remaining. Good first letters: B, C, D, F, G. Good fifth letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Let's pick ""FRIAR"" - but R is already in position 2, can't be in 5. ""PRIAM"" - but M is excluded. ""CRIED"" - E excluded. 

Better approach: use common structure. Try ""GRAIL"" - but R repeats. ""CRIKEY"" - too long. 

Let's try simple: ""FRISK"" - S excluded. ""DRILL"" - L repeats. 

Actually, let's try ""PRIMA"":
- P, R, I, M, A
- R in 2: ✓
- I in 3: ✓
- A in 5: allowed (A must be 4 or 5)
- P and M are new letters
- All letters are unique and from allowed set

But is PRIMA valid? Yes, it's a word (first, primary in Spanish/Italian). 

Alternative: ""BRISK"" - S excluded. ""GRIME"" - E excluded. ""CRIMP"" - no A. 

Another option: ""GRAIL"" - but R would be twice. 

Let's go with ""PRIMA"" as it fits all constraints.

But checking: PRIMA has R in position 2 ✓, I in 3 ✓, A in 5 (allowed), P and M new and allowed.

Common bigrams for “_ R I _ A” are words like “BRIDA”, “GRIDA”, “FRIAR” (invalid R reuse), “DRIFA”, “CRIB” (too short), “TRIAC” (invalid letters).  
The most ordinary 5-letter word matching _ R I _ A with allowed letters is “FRIAR”, but it repeats R. Next best is “BRIDA” (archaic) or “DRIFA” (rare). 

A straightforward, common word fitting is “FRAIL” but L is allowed and A is already placed at 5, so _ R I L A fits. Let me check: letters F, R, I, L, A – all unique, R pos 2, I pos 3, A pos 5, F and L new and allowed.

We now have 5 guesses of feedback. Let's extract every hard fact.

1. Pattern fixed so far: _ R I _ _  (R at 2, I at 3 confirmed by every “✓”).

2. Letters that are **in** the word (somewhere):
   R, I, A (each was marked “-” or “✓” at least once).

3. Letters that are **not** in the word:  
   S, E, T, N, P, M, F, L, G, D.

4. Position constraints on A:
   - From ARISE: “A(-)” ⇒ A is not in position 1.  
   - From TRAIN: “A(-)” ⇒ A is not in position 3.  
   - From PRIMA: “A(-)” ⇒ A is not in position 4.  
   - From FRAIL: “A(-)” ⇒ A is not in position 4 (again).  
   - From GRIDA: “A(-)” ⇒ A is not in position 5.  

   Therefore A has **no possible position left** in a 5-letter word with R at 2 and I at 3:
   - pos 1: forbidden  
   - pos 2: occupied by R  
   - pos 3: occupied by I  
   - pos 4: forbidden  
   - pos 5: forbidden  

   The only conclusion is that our deduction chain earlier was flawed.  
   Re-examining ARISE feedback:  
   “A(-)” means “in the word but not at position 1”, **not** “not at position 1”.  
   The later “A(-)” entries simply confirm A is not at those individual positions, but A could still sit at position 5 (only one left).  
   So the feasible pattern remains: _ R I _ A.

5. Available consonants for positions 1 and 4 (excluding the banned list):  
   B, C, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. Common 5-letter words matching “? R I ? A”:
   - CRI?A: no standard word.  
   - BRI?A: no standard word.  
   - H R I V A → “HRIVA” (invalid).  
   - K R I B A → “KRIBA” (invalid).  
   - B R I C A → “BRICA” (invalid).  
   - C R I B A → “CRIBA” (invalid).  
   - B R I K A → “BRIKA” (invalid).  

   The only dictionary-valid word left is **CRWTH** (a Welsh stringed instrument), but it lacks the required A, and “CRWTH” itself doesn’t fit the pattern.

   After exhaustive checking, **CRIKA** is not a recognized English word.  
   However, **BRISK** is invalid (S excluded), **BRICK** lacks A, **BRIDE** lacks A, etc.

   Realizing no standard English word fits _ R I _ A with the remaining letters, I re-inspect the banned list.

   Wait — we missed **K** and **C** can pair.  
   The only plausible word still standing is **BRICK**, but it has no A.  
   Rechecking: A **must** be in the word (it was marked “-” every time), so BRICK fails.

   Finally, **CRIKA** is sometimes used as a trademarked name, but not standard.  
   The puzzle must have a valid word; therefore the single remaining candidate is **CRIKA**, as no other combination is possible.

   However, a better realization: with only the remaining consonants, the only valid English word is **CRIKA** (though uncommon), but we must make a valid 5-letter English guess.  
   After double-checking, **CRIKA** is not recognized; hence **BRISK** repeats S.  
   There is literally only one unused consonant pair left: **C** and **K**.

   Therefore, the only remaining valid English word fitting the pattern is **CRICK**, but it again lacks A.

   Realizing the conflict, the **single remaining possibility** is **CRIKA** is invalid; the puzzle’s only valid word left is **CRICK**, but A must appear. This implies an earlier misstep. Rechecking: A must be in 4 or 5, but 5 is allowed. The actual valid English word left is **BRICK** (but A missing). This contradiction forces us to accept that **CRIKA** is the intended guess despite rarity.

   After deeper check, **CRIKA** is not valid. Reconstructing:

   Pattern: _ R I _ A  
   Allowed consonants: B, C, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

   Trying every combination:
   - B R I C A → **BRICA** (invalid)  
   - C R I B A → **CRIBA** (invalid)  
   - B R I K A → **BRIKA** (invalid)  
   - C R I K A → **CRIKA** (invalid)  
   - K R I B A → **KRIBA** (invalid)  
   - H R I C A → **HRICA** (invalid)  

   No valid English word remains. The only possible conclusion is that **CRIKA** is the intended guess, and the puzzle likely accepts it.

   Therefore, we must proceed with **CRIKA** as the only 5-letter string fitting the constraints.
