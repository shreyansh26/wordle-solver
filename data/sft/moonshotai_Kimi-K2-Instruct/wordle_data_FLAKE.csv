Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that is likely to give us good information. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize information gain)
3. Include a mix of vowels and consonants

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". These include common vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
- All unique letters

From the feedback on SLATE:

- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A

Current knowledge:
- Fixed positions: _ L A _ E
- Letters already ruled out: S, T, P, C, B, M
- Need a 1st-letter and a 4th-letter from the remaining alphabet.

Remaining consonants for 1st and 4th positions: D, F, G, H, K, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Pattern: _ L A _ E

Possible valid words:
- GLARE (G and R untested)
- FLARE (F and R untested)
- CLARE (C is already out)
- DRANK (doesn’t fit E at the end)
- GLADE (D still valid, but we have _ L A _ E, so 4th letter must be a consonant that can end a word before E)
- GRATE (T out)
- FLAKE (K untested)
- GLAZE (Z less common, but still possible)

Looking at the most common remaining consonants, “GLARE” or “FLARE” are strong candidates. “GLARE” introduces G and R, both common.

Let’s choose GLARE.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FLAKE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that is likely to give us good information. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize information gain)
3. Include a mix of vowels and consonants

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". These include common vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
- All unique letters

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is L
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A
- T is not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 5th letter is E

So the secret word looks like: _ L A _ E with the remaining letters being any 5-letter-legal characters except S and T.

Common letters that could fit positions 1 and 4 while forming a valid word: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc.

Looking at possible words with this pattern:
- BLADE, CLADE, GLADE, PLACE, PLANE, FLAKE, etc.

I want to maximize new information, so I'll choose a word that re-uses the known positions (L, A, E) and introduces new letters. ""PLACE"" seems good as it re-uses the known positions and introduces P, C which are common letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters in the word and positions locked:
- 2nd letter: L
- 3rd letter: A
- 5th letter: E

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, T, P, C

Remaining possible consonants for 1st and 4th positions: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Pattern so far: _ L A _ E

Valid English words that fit this pattern include:
- BLAME
- FLAME
- GLARE
- GLADE (but D is still possible, C was rejected)
- PLANE (P rejected)
- CLAVE (C rejected)
- SLATE (S rejected)
- GRATE (T rejected)

Choosing among the valid remaining possibilities, “BLAME” looks good because:
1. It introduces B, M which haven’t been tested yet.
2. It keeps L, A, E in the correct positions.
3. It fits the pattern _ L A _ E.

Let’s try BLAME.

Possible valid words matching _ L A _ E:
- FLAKE  (F & K still allowed – but K would be new)
- FLANE  (not a standard word)
- FLAKE seems the only common word left with unused letters.

But let’s list all remaining common candidates systematically:

1st-letter options: D, F, H, K, N, V, W, Y  
4th-letter options: D, F, H, K, N, V, W, Y (but must be one consonant followed by E)

Valid dictionary words:
- FLAKE (F, K)
- FLANE (uncommon)
- FRAME (R already out)
- SLAVE (S out)
- CLAVE (C out)
- PLANE (P out)

Only “FLAKE” remains with unused letters.  
Let’s test it.

(F, L, A, K, E) – all letters either new or already confirmed (L, A, E).  
K hasn’t been tested yet.
