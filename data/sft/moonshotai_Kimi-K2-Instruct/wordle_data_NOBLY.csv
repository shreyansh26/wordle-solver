For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to gather as much information as possible. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'm choosing ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)
This should provide a good spread of letters to see which ones might be in the secret word and their potential positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means:
1. O must appear somewhere other than the 3rd spot.
2. We completely ignore A, R, S, E for future guesses.
3. We need five new letters never tried before.

Popular consonants that haven’t been tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y.
Vowels left: I, U (and the already-known O).

A good strategy is to pick a new set of five distinct, high-frequency letters that include O in a different position.

   - Eliminated letters add: P, I, T
   - O is fixed in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

3. BOUND → B(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - Eliminated letters add: U, D
   - B is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (already known) or 5.

So far we know:
- Second letter is O
- Must contain B and N (positions unknown, but not 1 for B, not 4 or 5 for N)
- Eliminated letters: A, D, E, I, P, R, S, T, U

Remaining candidate letters (excluding those eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

With O fixed in position 2, and needing B and N somewhere else, let's look for valid positions:
- B cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5

Possible positions:
- N could be in position 1, 3
- B could be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is O), so positions 3,4,5

Let's try to construct a word:
- _ O _ _ _ (with N and B somewhere)
Possible combinations:
- N O B _ _ → but N is in position 1 (allowed), B in position 3
  Looking for 5-letter words: NOBLY fits this pattern.
  Checking letters: N, O, B, L, Y - all not eliminated.
  Also, N is in position 1 (new), B in position 3 (new), O in 2 (fixed).

This seems like a good next guess.

   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)
   - Eliminated letters add: P, I, T
