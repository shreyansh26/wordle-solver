For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters. A good choice is ""ARISE"" because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, I, S, E)
2. Uses 4 of the most common English letters (A, R, I, E)
3. Includes S which is also very common
4. Has no repeated letters, giving maximum feedback per letter

We know:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word and correctly in position 2.
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

We want a second guess that:
1. Keeps R in position 2.
2. Uses A in a different slot (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
4. Avoids I, S, E.

Remaining common letters: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, F, W, Y

A good choice is “R” in second place plus “A” somewhere else plus new high-frequency consonants. A word like “CRANK” would fit:
- C (new)
- R (confirmed in place)
- A (new position, third)
- N (new)
- K (new)

But let me think of one less obscure. “DRANK” uses D, A, N, K. “FRANK” uses F, A, N, K. “GRANT” uses G, A, N, T. “BRAND” uses B, A, N, D. “CRAMP” uses C, A, M, P.

Among these, “GRANT” uses G, A, N, T – all common and none excluded.

So: G R A N T.

Check: positions 1-5: G, R, A, N, T. Uses R in 2, A in 3, all new letters, and avoids I, S, E.

Good remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, W

Good remaining vowels: O, U, Y (only 5-letter words often end with a vowel or common consonant).
