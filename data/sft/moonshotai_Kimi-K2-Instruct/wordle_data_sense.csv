Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, I'm going to choose a word with common letters that are frequently used in English words. This helps maximize the amount of information we can gain from the feedback. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words, and it tests for some of the most frequent vowels and consonants.

Let me break this down:
- C: Very common starting letter
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This will give us good coverage regardless of what the secret word is.

A(x) – A is not in the word  
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4

- end with E (position 5 is fixed)  
- include N somewhere other than the 4th position

Good letters to try next are common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). I’ll pick a word like ""STONE"" which:

- contains N in position 3  
- uses S, T, O (none of which are ruled out yet).

Let's summarize everything we know after three guesses.

1. From CRANE (C, R, A ruled out; N is in the word but not in position 4; E is in position 5).
2. From STONE (S is in position 1; T, O ruled out; N is in word but not in position 3 or 4).
3. From SPINE (S confirmed in position 1; P is not in the word; I is not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4 or 3).

So now we have:
- Position 1: must be S.
- Position 5: must be E.
- N must be in position 2 (since it can't be 3 or 4 and E is fixed at 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, T, O, P, I.

Thus the word looks like: S N _ _ E.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that are not yet ruled out. The remaining consonants/vowels that haven't been forbidden include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid English word that fits S N _ _ E. Common words that fit this pattern include:

- SNUKE (though 'U' is allowed, 'K' is allowed)
- SNAKE (but A is ruled out)
- SNARE (A and R ruled out)
- SNEER (R ruled out)
- SNIPE (I and P ruled out)
- SNIDE (D and I: but I is ruled out)
- SNORE (O and R ruled out)
- SNURE (U is allowed, but R is ruled out)

Looking carefully, let's see possible combinations:
- Position 3: Could be U, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: Similarly, any of these

The only common word I can think of is ""SNUKE"" but that seems obscure. Another is ""SNAKE"" but A is ruled out. ""SNARE"" has A and R ruled out. ""SNEER"" has R ruled out. 

Wait, let's try ""SHINE"" but I is ruled out. ""SLIDE"" has I ruled out. ""SNIDE"" has I ruled out. 

Hmm, let's think differently. The remaining letters are quite limited. Let's list possible letters for positions 3 and 4:

From the alphabet excluding forbidden letters (C,R,A,T,O,P,I) and including that S,N,E are already used, possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common combinations:
- Position 3: Could be H, L, M, D, G, F, U, etc.
- Position 4: Similarly

Let me think of valid words:
- ""SNUKE"" seems obscure, but fits S N U K E
- ""SNOWE"" – but W is allowed, O is ruled out
- ""SNUGE"" – not a word
- ""SNARE"" – A and R ruled out
- ""SNAKE"" – A and K: A ruled out
- ""SNIDE"" – I ruled out
- ""SMILE"" – M and L are allowed, but I is ruled out
- ""SMOKE"" – O is ruled out

Actually, the only remaining plausible word seems to be ""SNUKE"" even if it's less common. But let me check if there's another.

Another angle: Position 3 and 4 must make a valid English word with S N _ _ E. Let's think of known words:

- ""SNAKE"" – A ruled out
- ""SNARE"" – A, R ruled out
- ""SNIDE"" – I ruled out
- ""SNOKE"" – O ruled out
- ""SNUKE"" – seems valid
- ""SHINE"" – I ruled out
- ""SPINE"" – already tried, P and I ruled out
- ""SWINE"" – I ruled out
- ""STONE"" – already tried, T and O ruled out
- ""SLIME"" – I ruled out
- ""SLIDE"" – I ruled out

Given the constraints, ""SNUKE"" appears to be the only possible word that fits all the letter positions and restrictions. 

Thus, the next logical guess is ""SNUKE"".

3. From SPINE (S confirmed in position 1; P is not in the word; I is not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4 or 3).

So now we have:
- Position 1: must be S.
- Position 5: must be E.
- N must be in position 2 (since it can't be 3 or 4 and E is fixed at 5).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sense,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, I'm going to choose a word with common letters that are frequently used in English words. This helps maximize the amount of information we can gain from the feedback. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words, and it tests for some of the most frequent vowels and consonants.

Let me break this down:
- C: Very common starting letter
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This will give us good coverage regardless of what the secret word is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)

C(x) – C is not in the word

A(x) – A is not in the word  
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5  

So, any new word must:
- end with E (position 5 is fixed)  
- include N somewhere other than the 4th position  
- exclude C, R, and A entirely  

Good letters to try next are common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). I’ll pick a word like ""STONE"" which:
- ends with E  
- contains N in position 3  
- uses S, T, O (none of which are ruled out yet).

STONE satisfies all the constraints we know so far.

2. From STONE:

   - N is still “in but wrong place” (now we know it’s not 3 or 4).
   - S is in position 1.
   - E is confirmed again in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be present: S, N, E (with E locked at 5).
- S must be in position 1.
- N must be in position 2 (positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, T, O.

So far we have:
S _ N _ E

The two missing letters (positions 2 and 4) can come only from the remaining alphabet, excluding the six letters already ruled out. A quick scan of common consonants/vowels left gives D, I, L, P, U, etc. A plausible word that fits S _ N _ E is “SPINE”:
- S in 1 ✓
- P in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 ✓
- I in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 ✓

Let’s use SPINE.

- Position 2: N showed “-” in STONE, so it’s not there.

- Position 4 has never been tried for N yet.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,sense,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, I'm going to choose a word with common letters that are frequently used in English words. This helps maximize the amount of information we can gain from the feedback. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words, and it tests for some of the most frequent vowels and consonants.

Let me break this down:
- C: Very common starting letter
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This will give us good coverage regardless of what the secret word is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess CRANE we got:

C(x) – C is not in the word  
R(x) – R is not in the word  
A(x) – A is not in the word  
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5  

So, any new word must:
- end with E (position 5 is fixed)  
- include N somewhere other than the 4th position  
- exclude C, R, and A entirely  

Good letters to try next are common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). I’ll pick a word like ""STONE"" which:
- ends with E  
- contains N in position 3  
- uses S, T, O (none of which are ruled out yet).

STONE satisfies all the constraints we know so far.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>1. From CRANE:
   - C, R, A are not in the word at all.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in position 5.

2. From STONE:
   - T and O are not in the word at all.
   - N is still “in but wrong place” (now we know it’s not 3 or 4).
   - S is in position 1.
   - E is confirmed again in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be present: S, N, E (with E locked at 5).
- S must be in position 1.
- N must be in position 2 (positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, T, O.

So far we have:
S _ N _ E

The two missing letters (positions 2 and 4) can come only from the remaining alphabet, excluding the six letters already ruled out. A quick scan of common consonants/vowels left gives D, I, L, P, U, etc. A plausible word that fits S _ N _ E is “SPINE”:
- S in 1 ✓
- P in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 ✓
- I in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 ✓

Let’s use SPINE.

<guess>SPINE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: SPINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize everything we know after three guesses.

1. From CRANE (C, R, A ruled out; N is in the word but not in position 4; E is in position 5).
2. From STONE (S is in position 1; T, O ruled out; N is in word but not in position 3 or 4).
3. From SPINE (S confirmed in position 1; P is not in the word; I is not in the word; N is in the word but not in position 4 or 3).

So now we have:
- Position 1: must be S.
- Position 5: must be E.
- N must be in position 2 (since it can't be 3 or 4 and E is fixed at 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, T, O, P, I.

Thus the word looks like: S N _ _ E.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that are not yet ruled out. The remaining consonants/vowels that haven't been forbidden include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid English word that fits S N _ _ E. Common words that fit this pattern include:

- SNUKE (though 'U' is allowed, 'K' is allowed)
- SNAKE (but A is ruled out)
- SNARE (A and R ruled out)
- SNEER (R ruled out)
- SNIPE (I and P ruled out)
- SNIDE (D and I: but I is ruled out)
- SNORE (O and R ruled out)
- SNURE (U is allowed, but R is ruled out)

Looking carefully, let's see possible combinations:
- Position 3: Could be U, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: Similarly, any of these

The only common word I can think of is ""SNUKE"" but that seems obscure. Another is ""SNAKE"" but A is ruled out. ""SNARE"" has A and R ruled out. ""SNEER"" has R ruled out. 

Wait, let's try ""SHINE"" but I is ruled out. ""SLIDE"" has I ruled out. ""SNIDE"" has I ruled out. 

Hmm, let's think differently. The remaining letters are quite limited. Let's list possible letters for positions 3 and 4:

From the alphabet excluding forbidden letters (C,R,A,T,O,P,I) and including that S,N,E are already used, possible letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common combinations:
- Position 3: Could be H, L, M, D, G, F, U, etc.
- Position 4: Similarly

Let me think of valid words:
- ""SNUKE"" seems obscure, but fits S N U K E
- ""SNOWE"" – but W is allowed, O is ruled out
- ""SNUGE"" – not a word
- ""SNARE"" – A and R ruled out
- ""SNAKE"" – A and K: A ruled out
- ""SNIDE"" – I ruled out
- ""SMILE"" – M and L are allowed, but I is ruled out
- ""SMOKE"" – O is ruled out

Actually, the only remaining plausible word seems to be ""SNUKE"" even if it's less common. But let me check if there's another.

Another angle: Position 3 and 4 must make a valid English word with S N _ _ E. Let's think of known words:

- ""SNAKE"" – A ruled out
- ""SNARE"" – A, R ruled out
- ""SNIDE"" – I ruled out
- ""SNOKE"" – O ruled out
- ""SNUKE"" – seems valid
- ""SHINE"" – I ruled out
- ""SPINE"" – already tried, P and I ruled out
- ""SWINE"" – I ruled out
- ""STONE"" – already tried, T and O ruled out
- ""SLIME"" – I ruled out
- ""SLIDE"" – I ruled out

Given the constraints, ""SNUKE"" appears to be the only possible word that fits all the letter positions and restrictions. 

Thus, the next logical guess is ""SNUKE"".

Let’s list every hard constraint we now have.

1. Positions locked:
   - Position 1 must be S.
   - Position 5 must be E.

2. Letter N must appear **exactly once** in the word, and every place it has been tried so far has shown “-”:
   - Position 2: N(-) in STONE → not 2.
   - Position 3: N(-) in SPINE → not 3.
   - Position 4: N(-) in SHYNE → not 4.

3. Forbidden letters that have produced “x” so far:
   C, R, A, T, O, P, I, U, K, H, Y.

4. We now know **N cannot fit anywhere** in the remaining open positions (2, 3, 4) because each has already returned “-”.  
   This contradicts the earlier conclusion that N must be in the word. The only resolution is that **N must be in none of the positions 2, 3, 4, 5**—but the word is only five letters, so **position 1 is already S**.  

Therefore the feedback chain is internally inconsistent; **there is no 5-letter English word that satisfies all of the above constraints**.  
The puzzle as presented cannot have a valid solution under the rules of Wordle/this game.

In a real game one would declare the puzzle impossible, but the rules require a 5-letter guess, so I will simply give the closest placeholder word that still obeys the locked S…E pattern while using only still-allowed letters.  
Allowed letters remaining (excluding the banned set) include, e.g., B, D, F, G, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A word that fits S _ _ _ E with none of the banned letters is “SWEDE”:
- S ✓  
- W allowed  
- E allowed (already known in 5)  
- D allowed  
- E ✓  

Even though we know N cannot fit anywhere, the prompt still demands a guess, so:

2. Letter N must appear **exactly once** in the word, and every place it has been tried so far has shown “-”:
   - Position 2: N(-) in STONE → not 2.
   - Position 3: N(-) in SPINE → not 3.
   - Position 4: N(-) in SHYNE → not 4.

3. Forbidden letters that have produced “x” so far:
   C, R, A, T, O, P, I, U, K, H, Y.

4. We now know **N cannot fit anywhere** in the remaining open positions (2, 3, 4) because each has already returned “-”.  
   This contradicts the earlier conclusion that N must be in the word. The only resolution is that **N must be in none of the positions 2, 3, 4, 5**—but the word is only five letters, so **position 1 is already S**.  

Therefore the feedback chain is internally inconsistent; **there is no 5-letter English word that satisfies all of the above constraints**.  
The puzzle as presented cannot have a valid solution under the rules of Wordle/this game.

In a real game one would declare the puzzle impossible, but the rules require a 5-letter guess, so I will simply give the closest placeholder word that still obeys the locked S…E pattern while using only still-allowed letters.  
Allowed letters remaining (excluding the banned set) include, e.g., B, D, F, G, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A word that fits S _ _ _ E with none of the banned letters is “SWEDE”:
- S ✓  
- W allowed  
- E allowed (already known in 5)  
- D allowed  
- E ✓  

Even though we know N cannot fit anywhere, the prompt still demands a guess, so:",Guess 6: SWEDE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) E(-) D(x) E(✓),FAIL
