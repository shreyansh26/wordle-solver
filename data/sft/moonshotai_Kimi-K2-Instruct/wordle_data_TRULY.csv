Since this is the first guess, I don't have any feedback to go on. My goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word with common letters and good letter distribution. I'll use a strategic first word that includes several of the most frequent letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C). 

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters (to test more letters)
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage across common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word AND in the correct position (second letter, “✓”)

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E (plus any others we might want to avoid repeating until we know more).

I need a 5-letter word with R in the second position and none of C, A, N, E.

Good letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that
1. Has R in position 2
2. Avoids C, A, N, E
3. Uses common, untested letters
4. Has no repeats to maximize information

Candidate words that fit: BRIEF, BRICK (but C is banned), BROKE (O, K, E – but E is banned), DRIPS, FROST, GRIND (N banned), PRISM, TRIPE.

The word “BROTH” meets the criteria (B, R, O, T, H – none of C, A, N, E), but contains H, which is moderately common.

Another good option is “DRIVE” – but it contains E, which is banned.

“BRISK” is excellent: B, R, I, S, K. No banned letters, uses common consonants B, S, K and vowel I.

Therefore, I’ll guess BRISK.

Avoid repeating letters (to test more letters)\n3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants\n\nPopular strategic first guesses include words like:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)\n- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage across common consonants and vowels.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)\n- R is in the word AND in the correct position (second letter, “✓”)\n\nSo the pattern is: _ R _ _ _\n\nLetters already ruled out: C, A, N, E (plus any others we might want to avoid repeating until we know more).\n\nI need a 5-letter word with R in the second position and none of C, A, N, E.\n\nGood letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nI’ll pick a word that\n1.

Key take-aways from all feedback:

Pattern locked: _ R _ _ _

Letters ruled out: C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, P, O, D  
Letters still available (common ones in bold): **F, G, H, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y**  
Only vowel left that is confirmed in the word: **U**  
Position of U: can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (it was marked “-” in PROUD).

So we need a 5-letter word that is:
- _ R U _ _  or  _ R _ U _  or  _ R _ _ U
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (no banned letters)
- Uses no repeats

Scanning for such words:

- FRUIT – F, R, U, I, T → I is banned → no  
- GRUNT – G, R, U, N, T → N is banned → no  
- TRULY – T, R, U, L, Y → all allowed  
- FUROR – double R and double U pattern issues → no  
- CRUSH – C banned → no  
- DRUMS – D, S banned → no  
- TRUCK – C banned → no  

TRULY fits perfectly: T, R, U, L, Y – none are banned, R is in position 2, U is in position 3 (still conforms to possible U locations), and it tests four new letters.
