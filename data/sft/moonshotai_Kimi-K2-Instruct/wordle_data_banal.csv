### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting some feedback. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover as many of these common letters as possible. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), and is a valid English word. This should give us good initial coverage to work with in subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

We now know:

- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

Since all four of those letters are out, we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Good letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong next candidate should introduce several new common letters. Keeping the known constraints in mind, a word like ""CLAMP"" would introduce C, L, M, P, and place A in position 2. Another possibility is ""FLANK"" with F, L, N, K and A in position 2.

From all the feedback so far we can extract:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, F, K, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, L, N, B (from the ✓ on B and the “-” marks on the others)  
- Positional constraints we now know:
  – B is in position 1 and must stay there (✓)  
  – L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
  – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3  
  – N is in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the word looks like:  
B _ _ _ _

We still need three more letters chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding the already-eliminated set R, O, S, E, F, K, D).  
Remaining useful letters: C, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z  

We also have to place A, L, N somewhere among positions 2-5 while respecting the positional bans:
- A cannot be in 3 → allowed positions: 2, 4, 5  
- L cannot be in 2 → allowed positions: 3, 4, 5  
- N cannot be in 4 → allowed positions: 2, 3, 5  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep B in position 1 (already locked).  
2. Place A, L, N in still-allowed spots.  
3. Introduce one new letter in the remaining slot to maximize information.

Let’s try:
B L A N ?  
But L in position 2 is banned (from Guess 2 feedback), so this is invalid.

Try:
B A L N ?  
A in position 2 is allowed; L in position 3 is allowed; N in position 4 is banned. Skip.

Try:
B A N L ?  
A in position 2 is allowed; N in position 3 is allowed; L in position 4 is allowed.  
We still need a fifth letter. Among unused consonants, T is common.  
→ B A N L T → “BANLT” (invalid). Swap to legal word “BLANT”? Not valid.

Re-evaluate: we need a real word. Let’s list 5-letter words that:
- Start with B
- Contain A, L, N (each in allowable positions)

Candidate:  
B A N A L  
Positions:  
B (1) fixed  
A (2) – allowed  
N (3) – allowed  
A (4) – allowed  
L (5) – allowed  
All constraints satisfied and it’s a real word.

Therefore, “BANAL” is a strong next guess.
