For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Uses vowels and consonants commonly found in English words

Some good options include: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters
- It has both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many English words
- No repeated letters

From the feedback on SLATE, we know:
- S, L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word at all.

So we must choose a 5-letter word that excludes these five letters.

Letters left that are common in English: R, I, N, D, C, O, U, M, P, etc.

I need a word with no S, L, A, T, E.

Some candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)
- CRIMP (but C, R, I, M, P - but I need to check for S,L,A,T,E: none appear)
- DUNNO (but has N twice)
- MURKY (M, U, R, K, Y - none of S,L,A,T,E)

I’ll choose ROUND because it uses very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- U, N, D are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D
- Letters confirmed: O is in position 2
- Letter to use somewhere else: R must appear in positions 2-5 (since it was wrong at 1), but position 2 is already O, so R must be in 3, 4, or 5

Common 5-letter words fitting these constraints:
- O is fixed at position 2
- Must include R at 3,4, or 5
- Must exclude: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find a word:
- _ O _ _ _ with R at 3,4, or 5
Possible patterns:
- _ O R _ _
- _ O _ R _
- _ O _ _ R

Examples:
- FORGO (but G and O are allowed, but has F, O, R, G, O - but O is already confirmed at position 2, but this has O twice which might be okay? Wait, we don't know O repeats)
- MORPH (M, O, R, P, H - none of banned letters)
- CORGI (but G, I are allowed)
- BORIC (B, O, R, I, C)

Best choice seems MORPH because:
- M, O, R, P, H - none of the banned letters appear

Let's digest the new feedback from MORPH:

Position 1 2 3 4 5  
Guess:   M O R P H  
Feedback x ✓ ✓ - ✓  

Interpretation:
1. M – not in the word (x)
2. O – correct position (✓) – position 2 locked
3. R – correct position (✓) – position 3 locked
4. P – in the word but wrong position (-) – must appear elsewhere (cannot be at 4)
5. H – correct position (✓) – position 5 locked

Known pattern so far:
- _ O R _ H
- P must appear somewhere in the remaining blanks (positions 1 or 4)

Letters already excluded: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, M

Remaining common unused letters: B, C, F, G, I, K, V, W, Y, Z plus P

We need a word that:
- Starts with P or has P in position 4
- Must fit P O R _ H or _ O R P H

Any valid word must also use letters not yet excluded.

Possibilities:
- P O R _ H: needs a letter for position 4 from remaining list
- _ O R P H: needs a letter for position 1 from remaining list

Let's list viable options:

1. P O R C H – letters P, O, R, C, H (all allowed so far)
2. P O R K H – but K is allowed
3. F O R P H – but F is allowed
4. C O R P H – but C is allowed

Among these, ""PORCH"" is a common English word and uses all known constraints:
- O in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 ✓
- H in position 5 ✓
- P in position 1 (new placement, but not in 4) ✓
- All letters allowed (no banned letters)

Therefore, ""PORCH"" is the logical next guess.
