For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Ideally, it should include several vowels and high-frequency consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. 

The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C - common consonant
- R - very common consonant
- A - most common vowel
- N - common consonant
- E - most common letter overall

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and should provide helpful feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Word shape: C A _ _ E
2. Letters that are definitely in the word and locked positions:
   - C in position 1
   - A in position 2
   - E in position 5
3. Letters that are in the word but NOT in their tested positions:
   - S must be in the word, but NOT in position 3 (because it was marked ""-"" in CASTE).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - R, N (from CRANE)
   - H (from CHASE)
   - T (from CASTE)

So the remaining unknown positions are 3 and 4. We know:
- S has to go into either position 3 or 4 (but cannot be 3), so S must be in position 4.
- That leaves position 3 to be filled with any letter not yet ruled out.

Thus the word must be:
C A _ S E

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with CA, ends with SE, and has one letter in the middle (position 3). The middle letter must not be any of R, N, H, T.

Common letters to try: L, D, B, M, P, etc.

Valid words that fit:
- CABLE (but B is allowed, and L is allowed) – but CABLE ends with E, but is C A B L E – this is 5 letters but the L is position 4 and E position 5, which would make it C A B L E – but our structure is C A _ S E. So CABLE is not matching.
- CADSE – not a word
- CAMSE – not a word
- CAPSE – not a word
- CAUSE – this fits: C A U S E. Let's check the letters:
   - C, A, U, S, E – none of R, N, H, T are used. And U is an allowed letter.
   - S is in position 4, which is allowed.
   - Meets all constraints.

CAUSE seems valid and fits all the feedback.
