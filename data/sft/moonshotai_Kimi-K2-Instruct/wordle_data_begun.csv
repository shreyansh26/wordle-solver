- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in English. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in the last position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E somewhere, but not as the final letter.
2. The word does NOT contain R, A, I, or S.

Goal: pick a 5-letter word without R, A, I, or S, that includes E somewhere other than the 5th position, and that is common enough to be discoverable in six turns.

A good strategy is to use letters that are common but weren’t used in the first guess, such as T, N, L, C, O, D, etc., together with the E that we now know is in the word.

A solid second-guess candidate is ""TENTE"", but that’s not an English word. ""TENET"" is a word, but it repeats T and E twice, which wastes letters. ""LEMON"" is possible, but lacks E in position 1–4. ""BENCH"" has E in position 2 and no forbidden letters. Or ""MELON"" (E in position 2). Another good common word is ""BLOKE"" (E in position 5, but we know E is not in position 5). So avoid that. ""DETER"" repeats E twice. 

Let’s pick ""BENCH"" because:
- It has E in position 2.
- It introduces B, N, C, H, none of which were in the first guess.
- It has no R, A, I, or S.

2. Contains N somewhere in positions 3-5
3. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S, C, H
4. From first guess: E is in word but NOT in position 5 (but we now know it's in position 2)

Possible letters for positions 3-5: from remaining alphabet excluding R,A,I,S,C,H. Common letters left: T, N, L, D, G, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Since N must appear in positions 3-5, possible structures:

- B E _ _ N

- B E _ N _ : ""BEGIN"" (but G not tested), ""BETON"" (not common)
