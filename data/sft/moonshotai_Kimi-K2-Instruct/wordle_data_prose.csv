For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify possible vowels and consonants in the word. The goal is to eliminate as many possible letters as quickly as possible. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R and S. However, since I don't have any prior information, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has a mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should help narrow down possibilities.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

1. The word has the form _ R O _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed: R, O, E).
2. Letters already ruled out anywhere: C, A, N, F, I, D, B, K.
3. We still need to find letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining alphabet: G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any other letters not listed as ruled out).

We need a common 5-letter word that matches the pattern ? R O ? E and only uses allowed letters.

Common words that fit:
- GROPE (but P is allowed)
- GROVE
- GROME (valid but uncommon)
- TROPE
- PROBE (but B is ruled out)
- CROME (C ruled out)

Let me choose ""GROVE"" because it's common and all its letters (G, R, O, V, E) are still allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Pattern: _ R O _ E  (positions 2 = R, 3 = O, 5 = E)
- Letters already eliminated anywhere: C, A, N, F, I, D, B, K, G, V
- Remaining consonants that can appear in positions 1 or 4: H, J, L, M, P, Q, S, T, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: none, because E and O are already placed and A, I are ruled out.

Possible combinations for the two blanks (position 1 and 4):

We need common English words fitting the pattern ? R O ? E.

Try common endings:
- ST in 4th position rarely appears before E.
- TH in 4th position: 4th letter T, 5th letter E – but we need 5th to be E, so 4th could be T giving TROTE? Not common.
- SL? Not common.
- SP? Not common.
- Let me list possible 4th letters with remaining consonants and see which make common words.

For 4th letter, possible common endings:
- TH, LE, SE, ME, NE, PE, RE, TE

But from eliminated letters, N and K are already out. So consider:
- LE: gives _ R O L E —> T R O L E? Not a word.
- ME: gives _ R O M E —> P R O M E? Not common.
- SE: gives _ R O S E —> T R O S E? Not a word.
- TE: gives _ R O T E —> P R O T E? Not common; but W R O T E is a word (past of write) but W is still available.
- H: _ R O H E —> T R O H E? Not a word.
- L: _ R O L E —> T R O L E? No.
- M: _ R O M E —> P R O M E? No.
- P: _ R O P E —> T R O P E? Not common, but G R O P E? G is ruled out.

Wait, let's list possible common words with pattern ? R O ? E and letters allowed:

- TROPE (P is allowed, T is allowed)
- WROTE (W is allowed, T is allowed)
- STROE? Not a word.
- From remaining letters, W and T are still allowed.

""WROTE"" uses W, R, O, T, E – all still allowed.
