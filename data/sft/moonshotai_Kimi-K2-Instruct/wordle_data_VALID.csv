For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. The letters C, R, N are consonants that could be in various positions, while A and E are common vowels. This should give good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback:

- C : x → not in word
- R : x → not in word
- A : - → in word, but wrong position (position 3)
- N : x → not in word
- E : x → not in word

So the word definitely contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 3.  
We know the letters C, R, N, E are NOT present.  
That means the remaining alphabet letters available include:  
B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z (plus A, which we know is somewhere).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
3. Uses letters from the remaining pool.

A good follow-up strategy is to test additional common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.  
I’ll try “FOALS” because:
- It has A (position 3 is now excluded for A, so A must be in 1,2,4, or 5 – here it’s in position 4).
- It omits C, R, N, E.
- It introduces O, L, S, F to test more letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Letters we know are NOT in the word  
C, R, N, E, F, O, S

Letters still untested that are common in 5-letter words  
B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Constraints for the next guess  
- Must include both A and L.  
- Must not use any of C, R, N, E, F, O, S.  
- Must place A in a different position than 3 (because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and marked “-”).  
- Must place L in a different position than 4 (because in FOALS, L was in position 4 and marked “-”).

One common English word that satisfies these constraints is “PLAID”, but P and I are still legal.  
However, P hasn’t been eliminated yet, and “PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D – none of the forbidden letters.  
But A would again be in position 3 and we already know A is NOT in position 3, so PLAID is invalid.

Next candidate: “GLADY” — but Y is rare and G, D, Y aren’t ruled out. Better to stick with more common letters.

Better choice: “PLANK” — but N is already out.

This should give good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n\n- C : x → not in word\n- R : x → not in word\n- A : - → in word, but wrong position (position 3)\n- N : x → not in word\n- E : x → not in word\n\nSo the word definitely contains the letter A, but A is NOT in position 3.  \nWe know the letters C, R, N, E are NOT present.  \nThat means the remaining alphabet letters available include:  \nB D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z (plus A, which we know is somewhere).\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 3).\n2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses letters from the remaining pool.\n\nA good follow-up strategy is to test additional common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.  \nI’ll try “FOALS” because:\n- It has A (position 3 is now excluded for A, so A must be in 1,2,4, or 5 – here it’s in position 4).\n- It omits C, R, N, E.\n- It introduces O, L, S, F to test more letters.\n\n<guess>FOALS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FOALS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(x) A(-) L(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\nLetters we know are NOT in the word  \nC, R, N, E, F, O, S\n\nLetters we know ARE in the word (but positions still unknown)  \nA, L (both showed “-”: present, but wrong spot in their guesses)\n\nLetters still untested that are common in 5-letter words  \nB, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nConstraints for the next guess  \n- Must include both A and L.  \n- Must not use any of C, R, N, E, F, O, S.  \n- Must place A in a different position than 3 (because in CRANE, A was in position 3 and marked “-”).  \n- Must place L in a different position than 4 (because in FOALS, L was in position 4 and marked “-”).\n\nOne common English word that satisfies these constraints is “PLAID”, but P and I are still legal.  \nHowever, P hasn’t been eliminated yet, and “PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D – none of the forbidden letters.  \nBut A would again be in position 3 and we already know A is NOT in position 3, so PLAID is invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “GLADY” — but Y is rare and G, D, Y aren’t ruled out.

From the latest feedback:
- BALMY → B(x) A(✓) L(✓) M(x) Y(x)

This tells us:
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- B, M, Y are not in the word.

Combining with earlier feedback:
Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E, F, O, S, B, M, Y.
Letters definitely present and fixed: A (pos 2), L (pos 3).
Letters still untested that are common: D, G, H, I, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We now know the word has the pattern:
- Position 1: any of the allowed letters (must not be in the forbidden list)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: any allowed letter

Common words fitting this pattern: D, G, H, I, K, P, T, U, W could fit in positions 1, 4, 5.

A good candidate is ""HALVE"" but V and E are already forbidden (E was out from CRANE).
Next: ""TALKS"" – but S is out.
Next: ""PALSY"" – S and Y are out.
Next: ""GALAX"" – but X is rare.
Next: ""DAHLI"" – but H and I and D could fit.
Actually ""DAHLI"" isn't a valid word.

Better: ""VALID"" – but D is allowed, and V is allowed. But A and L are already fixed in positions 2 and 3, so the word must be _ A L _ _.

Looking for _ A L _ _:
- D A L E Y – but E is out.
- D A L T Y – but Y is out.
- G A L L Y – Y out.
- P A L L Y – Y out.
- H A L L S – S out.

- D A L L Y – Y out.
- D A L T O – O out.
- K A L E S – E and S out.
- D A L K A – not a word.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter English words with _ A L _ _:
- D A L K Y – invalid.
- D A L L S – invalid (S out).
- G A L L S – invalid (S).
- H A L L S – invalid (S).

- G A L L Y – Y out.
- H A L L Y – Y out.
- P A L L Y – Y out.
- W A L L Y – Y out.
- D A L I A – not a word.

Hmm, it seems most _ A L _ _ words end with Y or S or contain forbidden letters. Maybe look at _ A L _ with other endings.

Real words:
- D A L I Y – not valid.
- W A L K S – S out.
- T A L K S – S out.
- T A L K Y – Y out.
- D A L K S – S out.
- G A L K I – not a word.
- H A L K I – not a word.
- P A L K I – not a word.
- D A L K I – not a word.
- K A L I D – not _ A L _ _.
Wait, K A L I D is K A L I D, positions don't match.

Actually, valid _ A L _ _ words:
- D A L T O – not a word.
- G A L L A – not common.
- H A L L A – not common.
- P A L L A – not common.
- T A L C A – not a word.
- D A L E K – not a word.

- G A L L S – S out.
- H A L L S – S out.
- P A L L S – S out.
- W A L K S – S out.
- T A L K S – S out.

This is surprising. Maybe the word ends with a letter we haven't tried. Let's list all letters not yet excluded:
Allowed letters in positions 1,4,5: D, G, H, I, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible _ A L _ _ words:
- D A L E Y – E out.
- D A L I Y – Y out.
- D A L K Y – Y out.
- D A L L Y – Y out.
- G A L L Y – Y out.
- H A L L Y – Y out.
- P A L L Y – Y out.
- T A L L Y – Y out.
- W A L L Y – Y out.
- D A L K A – not a word.
- K A L I D – positions don't match _ A L _ _.
- T A L K Y – Y out.
- D A L K I – not a word.
- H A L V E – E out.
- W A L K Y – Y out.

It seems many end with Y or S or contain E. Let's try ""D A L K I"" – not a word.
""G A L L Y"" – Y out.
""K A L I D"" – positions don't match.

Wait, ""DALAI"" is a word (as in Dalai Lama), but I is in position 4 and D in 1 and 5, but let's see:
- D A L A I – but A is already in position 2, so this would be D A L A I, but L is in position 3, so pattern is _ A L _ _. So D A L A I fits, but A is already used in position 2, so the second A is allowed as long as it's not the same A. However, ""DALAI"" is 5 letters: D A L A I, positions 1=D, 2=A, 3=L, 4=A, 5=I. Letters D, A, L, A, I – but A is already fixed in position 2, so this is acceptable as it uses A in position 4, which is allowed.

But is ""DALAI"" a valid English word? It’s a proper noun (Dalai Lama), usually capitalized, so might not count.

Next: ""DALTI"" – not a word.
""HALID"" – as in halide, but that's 6 letters.
""KALIF"" – F is allowed? F is not forbidden, but from earlier, F was in FOALS and marked x, so F is out.
""VALID"" – V is allowed, D is allowed, I is allowed. Pattern is V A L I D, which fits _ A L _ _.

So ""VALID"" is a valid word: V A L I D. Let's check letters:
- V: allowed (not in forbidden list)
- A: position 2, correct (from BALMY)
- L: position 3, correct (from BALMY)
- I: allowed
- D: allowed

No forbidden letters. This seems the most plausible.

Thus, the next guess is VALID.
