For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in the English language. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One of the best starter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- No repeated letters, maximizing coverage of the alphabet

Current known information:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  

Positions ruled out for those letters:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) or position 2 again (from TRIES) → R ≠ 2
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from TRIES) → S ≠ 4,5
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 4 (from TRIES) → E ≠ 4,5

We still need two more letters (positions 1 and 2 or 3) that haven’t been tried yet and are not in the forbidden set {A,O,T,I}. Preferably common consonants.

Good candidates for the unknown letters: N, L, H, C, D, B, M …

A word that places R, S, E in new possible positions and introduces new common letters is “NERDS”.

Check positions:
- N – new, position 1
- E – position 2 (hasn’t been ruled out)
- R – position 3 (hasn’t been ruled out)
- D – new, position 4
- S – position 5 (but S ≠ 5 is already ruled out) → conflict, so NERDS won’t work.

Try “CREST”:
- C – new, position 1
- R – position 2 (but R ≠ 2 is ruled out) → conflict.

Try “PRESS” – duplicates S and P hasn’t been ruled out, but repeats S which may not help.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). \n\nOne of the best starter words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common\n- Two common consonants (R, S) \n- No repeated letters, maximizing coverage of the alphabet\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.\n- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo we know the word:\n- Does NOT contain A or O.\n- Does contain R, S, E, each in some position other than the one they occupied in AROSE.\n- Needs two more letters.\n\nA good next guess should:\n1. Confirm the positions of R, S, E.\n2. Introduce new common letters.\n\n""TRIES"" fits:\n- Keeps R, S, E.\n- Adds T and I (common new letters).\n- Moves R to position 3, S to position 5, E to position 4 (none in their previous positions).\n\n<guess>TRIES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current known information:\n\nLetters that are definitely IN the word: R, S, E  \nLetters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  \n\nPositions ruled out for those letters:\n- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) or position 2 again (from TRIES) → R ≠ 2\n- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 5 (from TRIES) → S ≠ 4,5\n- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 4 (from TRIES) → E ≠ 4,5\n\nWe still need two more letters (positions 1 and 2 or 3) that haven’t been tried yet and are not in the forbidden set {A,O,T,I}.

From the new feedback:

- S(✓) – S is in the word and is in position 1.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- M(✓) – M is in the word and is in position 5.

So we now know the word structure:  
S _ _ _ M  

And we still have these letters definitely in the word: R, E  
And these letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I, U  

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2, 3
- E ≠ 2, 4, 5

We need two more consonants for positions 2 and 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are taken by S and M).

Possible consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We must place E somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 3 or 4). But E ≠ 4 (from AROSE feedback), so E must be in position 3.

Therefore the word structure is:
S _ E _ M

Position 2 and 4 need two different consonants from the allowed set, and position 2 must allow R (since R is in the word, and R ≠ 2,3 is already ruled out, but R could be in position 4). Wait, let's list possibilities:

Letters left to fill: positions 2 and 4.  
Known letters to place: R must go somewhere, and we have no other letters known to be in the word.

Since we have S E M already, and R must be in the word, R must occupy either position 2 or 4.  
But R ≠ 2 (from AROSE feedback), so R must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: S _ E R M

Only position 2 remains. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (not A, O, T, I, U, and not S, E, R, M).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
