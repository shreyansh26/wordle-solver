For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Good vowel coverage
3. Common consonants

Looking at letter frequency data, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: A, E, S, O, R, I, L, T, N, D, etc. 

A strong initial word would be one that combines these frequent letters, with both vowels and consonants. 

Some good candidates are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers 3 top consonants and 2 top vowels
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers common consonants and vowels
- AUDIO - but this has 4 vowels, which might not be ideal
- AROSE - covers 3 vowels and 2 common consonants

I'll go with SLATE as it's often recommended as an optimal starting word, containing S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters that appear in many positions across 5-letter words.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - T is fixed in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - S, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From CLINT:
   - C is NOT in the word (x).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) ‑- already known.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - N is NOT in the word (x).
   - T is NOT in position 5 (-) but we already knew it was fixed in position 4.

So current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T _
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- I must appear somewhere other than position 3.
- No S, A, E, C, N.
- T is fixed in position 4.

Remaining common letters to draw from:
- Consonants: R, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y
- Vowels: I, O, U

Since L must appear and cannot be in position 2, possible positions for L are 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 5 might be awkward because T is already fixed in position 4, so consonants often end words. Let’s try L in position 1 or 3.

Also, I must appear but not in position 3, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.

Candidate words:
- L _ I T _  (positions 1,3,4 fixed-ish)
- _ L _ T _
- _ _ L T _

Let me think of valid words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

Examples:
- LIMIT – but I would be in position 3, which is disallowed.
- BUILT – has U, I, L, T; but T is not in position 4 (it’s position 4 here, ok), but B, U, I, L, T – check pattern:
   - B, U, I, L, T  → _ U I L T – no, T must be position 4 only, so fails.
- PILOT – P, I, L, O, T – but T is position 5 here, not allowed.
- GUILT – G, U, I, L, T – T is position 5 – no.
- BUILT – same issue.
- FLIRT – F, L, I, R, T – positions: 1=F, 2=L, 3=I, 4=R, 5=T – T must be 4, so no.
- BULIT – invalid, not a word.
- BLOUT – not standard.
- BLIPT – T is position 5 – no.
- QUILT – invalid, Q not allowed.
- DRIVE – no, doesn’t fit pattern.

Instead, let’s try:
- _ L _ T _ with I in position 1 or 2 or 5, and L in position 2 is disallowed.

Wait, L can’t be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), but in CLINT L was in position 2 and marked (-), so L cannot be in position 2.

So L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s try L in position 3:
- _ _ L T _ – but then we need a vowel in positions 1,2,5, and I must appear somewhere (not 3).
Possible word: D R I L T – no.
B R I L T – not a word.
P R I L T – no.

L in position 1:
- L _ _ T _ – need vowels/consonants, I must appear somewhere (not 3), so positions 2,3,5.
Possible: L I _ T _ – but I can’t be in position 3, so:
L I R T _ – but need 5 letters, and T is position 4, so:
L I R T ? – last letter must be consonant, but N is out, S out, E out, A out, C out.
Options: L I R T H / L I R T Y / L I R T D / etc. – LIRTH not a word, LIRTY no, LIRTD no.
L I V T Y – no.

L in position 5:
- _ _ _ T L – then positions 1,2,3 must include I somewhere (not 3 if we put I in 3, but 3 is allowed for I since restriction was I not in 3 from CLINT, but in CLINT I was in 3 marked (-), so I cannot be in 3.
So I must be in 1 or 2.
Possible word: I _ _ T L – I R D T L – no.
B I _ T L – B I R T L – not standard.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words with T in 4th and see which fit:
- BUILT – T is 5th – no.
- DROIT – T is 4th? D R O I T – yes, T is 5th – no.
- FRUIT – T is 5th – no.
- AMBIT – T is 5th – no.
- VOMIT – T is 5th – no.
- LIMIT – T is 4th? L I M I T – T is 5th – no.
- SPLIT – T is 5th – no.
- FLIRT – T is 5th – no.
- SHIFT – T is 5th – no.
- GUILT – T is 5th – no.

Actually, let me think differently: words ending T _ are less common, but T is 4th, so last letter is 5th.

Better word: B R I D T – no.
Wait, let’s think of words like:

- B L I T H – B L I T H – but T is 4th, H 5th. Check constraints:
   - Has B, L, I, T, H.
   - L is in position 2 – but from SLATE, L was in position 2 marked (-), so L cannot be in position 2. So BLITH is invalid.

- F L I T H – same issue with L in 2.

- M U L C T – no, C is out.

- P U L I T – P U L I T – T is 5th – no.

- R U D T Y – no, D, U, R, T, Y – T is 4th. Check:
   - Letters: R, U, D, T, Y.
   - L is missing – we know L must be in word.

- D R U L T – no.

- G R I L T – G R I L T – T is 5th – no.

- H I L T Y – no.

- P R I L T – no.

I need to find a valid word with:
- T at 4th.
- L somewhere (1,3,5).
- I somewhere (1,2,5).
- No S, A, E, C, N.

Let me construct systematically:

Option 1: L _ _ T _
   - L I _ T _ – I in 2nd: L I R T H – L I R T H – is this a word? LIRTH doesn’t seem valid.
   - L O _ T _ – L O R T H – no.
   - L U _ T _ – L U R T H – no.

Option 2: _ _ L T _
   - _ I L T _ – B I L T _ – but D, H possible: B I L T H – B I L T H – T is 4th, H 5th. Check:
      - Letters: B, I, L, T, H.
      - L is in 3rd – allowed (was only restricted from 2).
      - I is in 2nd – allowed.
      - No forbidden letters.
      - BILTH – is this a word? No, seems not.

   - D I L T Y – D I L T Y – T is 4th. Check:
      - D, I, L, T, Y – valid letters, meets constraints.
      - DILTY – is this a word? Not standard.

   - F I L T H – F I L T H – T is 4th, H 5th. Check:
      - F, I, L, T, H – all allowed.
      - FILTH is a valid word.

Let me check FILTH against all constraints:
1. T is 4th – yes (✓).
2. L is in word (position 3) – allowed (not in 2).
3. I is in word (position 2) – allowed (not in 3).
4. No S, A, E, C, N – correct.
5. All letters valid.

Thus, FILTH is a valid candidate.

</think>

Current deductions:
- T is fixed in position 4.
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- I must appear somewhere other than position 3.
- Forbidden letters: S, A, E, C, N.

The word that satisfies all these checks and is valid is **FILTH**.

<guess>FILTH</guess>",FILTH,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - T is fixed in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - S, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From CLINT:
   - C is NOT in the word (x).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) ‑- already known.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - N is NOT in the word (x).
   - T is NOT in position 5 (-) but we already knew it was fixed in position 4.

So current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ T _
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- I must appear somewhere other than position 3.
- No S, A, E, C, N.
- T is fixed in position 4.

Remaining common letters to draw from:
- Consonants: R, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y
- Vowels: I, O, U

Since L must appear and cannot be in position 2, possible positions for L are 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 5 might be awkward because T is already fixed in position 4, so consonants often end words. Let’s try L in position 1 or 3.

Also, I must appear but not in position 3, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.

Candidate words:
- L _ I T _  (positions 1,3,4 fixed-ish)
- _ L _ T _
- _ _ L T _

Let me think of valid words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

Examples:
- LIMIT – but I would be in position 3, which is disallowed.
- BUILT – has U, I, L, T; but T is not in position 4 (it’s position 4 here, ok), but B, U, I, L, T – check pattern:
   - B, U, I, L, T  → _ U I L T – no, T must be position 4 only, so fails.
- PILOT – P, I, L, O, T – but T is position 5 here, not allowed.
- GUILT – G, U, I, L, T – T is position 5 – no.
- BUILT – same issue.
- FLIRT – F, L, I, R, T – positions: 1=F, 2=L, 3=I, 4=R, 5=T – T must be 4, so no.
- BULIT – invalid, not a word.
- BLOUT – not standard.
- BLIPT – T is position 5 – no.
- QUILT – invalid, Q not allowed.
- DRIVE – no, doesn’t fit pattern.

Instead, let’s try:
- _ L _ T _ with I in position 1 or 2 or 5, and L in position 2 is disallowed.

Wait, L can’t be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback), but in CLINT L was in position 2 and marked (-), so L cannot be in position 2.

So L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s try L in position 3:
- _ _ L T _ – but then we need a vowel in positions 1,2,5, and I must appear somewhere (not 3).
Possible word: D R I L T – no.
B R I L T – not a word.
P R I L T – no.

L in position 1:
- L _ _ T _ – need vowels/consonants, I must appear somewhere (not 3), so positions 2,3,5.
Possible: L I _ T _ – but I can’t be in position 3, so:
L I R T _ – but need 5 letters, and T is position 4, so:
L I R T ? – last letter must be consonant, but N is out, S out, E out, A out, C out.
Options: L I R T H / L I R T Y / L I R T D / etc. – LIRTH not a word, LIRTY no, LIRTD no.
L I V T Y – no.

L in position 5:
- _ _ _ T L – then positions 1,2,3 must include I somewhere (not 3 if we put I in 3, but 3 is allowed for I since restriction was I not in 3 from CLINT, but in CLINT I was in 3 marked (-), so I cannot be in 3.
So I must be in 1 or 2.
Possible word: I _ _ T L – I R D T L – no.
B I _ T L – B I R T L – not standard.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words with T in 4th and see which fit:
- BUILT – T is 5th – no.
- DROIT – T is 4th? D R O I T – yes, T is 5th – no.
- FRUIT – T is 5th – no.
- AMBIT – T is 5th – no.
- VOMIT – T is 5th – no.
- LIMIT – T is 4th? L I M I T – T is 5th – no.
- SPLIT – T is 5th – no.
- FLIRT – T is 5th – no.
- SHIFT – T is 5th – no.
- GUILT – T is 5th – no.

Actually, let me think differently: words ending T _ are less common, but T is 4th, so last letter is 5th.

Better word: B R I D T – no.
Wait, let’s think of words like:

- B L I T H – B L I T H – but T is 4th, H 5th. Check constraints:
   - Has B, L, I, T, H.
   - L is in position 2 – but from SLATE, L was in position 2 marked (-), so L cannot be in position 2. So BLITH is invalid.

- F L I T H – same issue with L in 2.

- M U L C T – no, C is out.

- P U L I T – P U L I T – T is 5th – no.

- R U D T Y – no, D, U, R, T, Y – T is 4th. Check:
   - Letters: R, U, D, T, Y.
   - L is missing – we know L must be in word.

- D R U L T – no.

- G R I L T – G R I L T – T is 5th – no.

- H I L T Y – no.

- P R I L T – no.

I need to find a valid word with:
- T at 4th.
- L somewhere (1,3,5).
- I somewhere (1,2,5).
- No S, A, E, C, N.

Let me construct systematically:

Option 1: L _ _ T _
   - L I _ T _ – I in 2nd: L I R T H – L I R T H – is this a word? LIRTH doesn’t seem valid.
   - L O _ T _ – L O R T H – no.
   - L U _ T _ – L U R T H – no.

Option 2: _ _ L T _
   - _ I L T _ – B I L T _ – but D, H possible: B I L T H – B I L T H – T is 4th, H 5th. Check:
      - Letters: B, I, L, T, H.
      - L is in 3rd – allowed (was only restricted from 2).
      - I is in 2nd – allowed.
      - No forbidden letters.
      - BILTH – is this a word? No, seems not.

   - D I L T Y – D I L T Y – T is 4th. Check:
      - D, I, L, T, Y – valid letters, meets constraints.
      - DILTY – is this a word? Not standard.

   - F I L T H – F I L T H – T is 4th, H 5th. Check:
      - F, I, L, T, H – all allowed.
      - FILTH is a valid word.

Let me check FILTH against all constraints:
1. T is 4th – yes (✓).
2. L is in word (position 3) – allowed (not in 2).
3. I is in word (position 2) – allowed (not in 3).
4. No S, A, E, C, N – correct.
5. All letters valid.

Thus, FILTH is a valid candidate.Current deductions:
- T is fixed in position 4.
- L must appear somewhere other than position 2.
- I must appear somewhere other than position 3.
- Forbidden letters: S, A, E, C, N.

The word that satisfies all these checks and is valid is **FILTH**.",Guess 3: FILTH -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
