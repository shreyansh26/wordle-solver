For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me good coverage of common letters in the English language. Words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are often good choices. 

One classic starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - giving good coverage of both vowels and consonants. However, since I have no feedback yet, any 5-letter word is equally valid as a starting point. 

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 distinct letters that are very common in English words.

Let me analyze the feedback from the first guess AROSE:

A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st letter)
R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd letter)
O(x): O is not in the word
S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th letter)
E(x): E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, and S, but they're not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain O or E
- This leaves positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with constraints:
  - Position 1: Not A, O, E
  - Position 2: Not R, O, E
  - Position 3: No constraints on A, R, S since they could move here
  - Position 4: Not S, O, E
  - Position 5: No constraints on A, R, S since they could move here

Since A, R, and S must be placed in new positions, and we need to avoid O and E entirely, let's think of words that use these letters plus some other common consonants.

Good candidates would be:
- Words rearranging A, R, S with common consonants like T, L, N, etc.
- Examples: ""STARS"" (but S is in position 4 which we know is wrong), ""RATES"" (but E is excluded), ""TRASH"" (but H is uncommon), ""START"" (but E is excluded)

Let me try ""STRAP"" - this uses S, T, R, A, P. T and P are common consonants, and this rearranges our known letters A, R, S into new positions.

Let’s consolidate the information gathered so far.

1. From AROSE:
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are NOT in the word.

2. From STRAP:
   - S is correctly placed in position 1.  
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - P is NOT in the word.

So the target word looks like:

S _ _ _ _

and must include the letters A, R, T somewhere in positions 2-5, with the following constraints:

- A cannot be in position 4.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- T cannot be in position 2.
- No O, E, or P anywhere.

Let’s list the remaining letters we can use: consonants we haven’t tried yet include C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We already know A, T, R must appear among positions 2-5.

A good strategy is to slot the required letters into positions that satisfy the constraints.  
R cannot be in 2 or 3, so R can only be in position 4 or 5.  
A cannot be in position 4, so A can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
T cannot be in position 2, so T can be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to fill a pattern that respects these rules.  
One promising pattern is S A R T _ or S A _ R T or S _ A R T etc.

In particular, S A R T _ would require a fifth letter (position 5) that we haven’t excluded.  
But we already have S, A, R, T and need one more letter.  
We could insert a common consonant like L or N.

Let’s test S A R T N → “SARTN” – wait, that’s not a valid word.

Try S T A R _ → but T cannot be in position 2, so “ST...” is okay for S(1) T(2) only if T is allowed in position 2.  
But feedback says T is in the word but NOT in position 2, so T must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

Try S _ A T _ where R still needs to be placed.  
For example, S A T R _ → “SATRN” – again not valid.

Let’s pick valid words instead of forcing patterns.  
A common word that starts with S and contains A, R, T is “START” – but E is excluded, so “START” is valid since it has no E or O or P.

Check constraints:
- S is correct in position 1 (matches feedback).
- T is in position 2 – but the feedback said T is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
  So “START” would fail here.

Next, “STARS” – but no T.

“STRAW” – but W hasn’t been eliminated, but we already know P is excluded and we have no info on W yet.  
However, we need to include T, and “STRAW” lacks T.

“STRAND” is 6 letters – too long.

“STRAIN” – 6 letters.

“STARK” – this has S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), K(5).  
Check constraints:
- S is correct in 1.  
- T is in position 2 – but feedback said T is NOT in position 2.  
  So “STARK” is invalid.

“STARL” – not a valid word.

“STARY” – not a word.

“CARST” – doesn’t start with S.

“SWART” – starts with S, has W, A, R, T.  
Check positions: S(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), T(5).  
Constraints:
- S is correct in 1.  
- T is in position 5 – allowed (not position 2).  
- A is in position 3 – allowed (not position 4).  
- R is in position 4 – allowed (not positions 2 or 3).  
- W hasn’t been excluded.  

But we haven’t eliminated W yet, and we need to confirm that SWART is a valid word – it is, though obscure.

A better, more common word is “SCART” – but C hasn’t been excluded, and it’s a bit rare.

“SATYR” – has S, A, T, Y, R – Y hasn’t been excluded.  
Positions: S(1), A(2), T(3), Y(4), R(5).  
Check constraints:
- S is correct in 1.  
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not position 4).  
- T is in position 3 – allowed (not position 2).  
- R is in position 5 – allowed (not positions 2 or 3).  
- Y hasn’t been excluded.

“SATYR” is a valid word and fits all constraints.

So my next guess is SATYR.
