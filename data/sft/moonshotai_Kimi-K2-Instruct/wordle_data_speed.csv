Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A common strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that uses a variety of frequently occurring letters. This helps gather maximum information early. 

Good choices often include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is a classic first guess because it contains five unique, common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This maximizes the chance of getting some hits or partial matches to guide subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE we know:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word at all (x on each).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word definitely contains both S and E, and does not contain A, R, or O.

Since S and E are misplaced, we need to move them to new positions while introducing new letters. Common consonants that haven’t been eliminated are N, T, L, I, D, etc. We also still need to place E somewhere else.

A good next step is to test new positions for S and E while adding other common letters. A word like “STEIN” would reuse S and E in new spots and add T, I, N—none of which have been ruled out yet. However, checking quickly: STEIN uses S in position 1 (same as AROSE’s position 4 for S), so S might still be misplaced here. 

A better choice is “TENSE”: it keeps E in a new position (2 or 4), moves S to a new spot (1 or 5), and adds T, N—both high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet. This maximizes new information.

Let’s go with “TENSE” where:

- In TENSE, the first E (position 2) and the last E (position 5) both got “-”, yet we know a 5-letter word can’t contain two E’s unless the puzzle allows repeats (standard Wordle rules do not).  That contradiction means the word must contain exactly one E, and it is NOT in positions 2 or 5.

So correct positions for S and E are still open (except they’re not in the spots already marked).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Good choices often include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is a classic first guess because it contains five unique, common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words.

- A, R, O are NOT in the word at all (x on each).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word definitely contains both S and E, and does not contain A, R, or O.

Since S and E are misplaced, we need to move them to new positions while introducing new letters. Common consonants that haven’t been eliminated are N, T, L, I, D, etc. We also still need to place E somewhere else.

A good next step is to test new positions for S and E while adding other common letters. A word like “STEIN” would reuse S and E in new spots and add T, I, N—none of which have been ruled out yet. However, checking quickly: STEIN uses S in position 1 (same as AROSE’s position 4 for S), so S might still be misplaced here. 

A better choice is “TENSE”: it keeps E in a new position (2 or 4), moves S to a new spot (1 or 5), and adds T, N—both high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet. This maximizes new information.

Let’s go with “TENSE” where:

From the feedback:
- In TENSE, the first E (position 2) and the last E (position 5) both got “-”, yet we know a 5-letter word can’t contain two E’s unless the puzzle allows repeats (standard Wordle rules do not).  That contradiction means the word must contain exactly one E, and it is NOT in positions 2 or 5.

  E : not in positions 2 or 5 (from TENSE)

Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A compact choice is “SLICE”:

  E : not in positions 2 or 5 (from TENSE)

We need a new word that:
1. Contains S and E once each.
2. Places S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
3. Places E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
4. Introduces only letters that haven’t been eliminated yet (no A, R, O, T, N).

Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
To maximize information, pick a word that tests several fresh consonants while obeying the placement rules for S and E.

A compact choice is “SLICE”:
- S in position 1 (new spot)
- L, I, C new consonants/vowel
- E in position 4 (new spot and satisfies the constraints)

This tests three new letters and re-tests S and E in permissible locations.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters eliminated: A, R, O, T, N, L, I, C  
Letters confirmed in the word (exact counts):  
 S – must be in position 1 (✓)  
 E – must appear once, and may not be in positions 2,3,5  

Therefore the hidden pattern is:

S _ _ E _

Only positions 2 and 3 remain to be filled; they must be letters not yet ruled out.
Available letters (common, not eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word beginning with S and ending with E that has one additional letter in position 2 and one in position 3, drawn from the available set.

Candidate words:
- SPUME  (P, U)
- SWEDE  (W, D)
- SMOTE  (M, O) – but O is eliminated
- SPIKE  (P, I) – but I is eliminated
- SHADE  (H, A) – A eliminated
- SUEDE  (U, D) – valid letters

SUEDE fits all constraints: S-fixed, E in position 4, and letters U, D are both still allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 ✓).
2. It contains exactly one E, and that E is in position 3 (✓).
3. Position 5 has NOT been E in either of the two placements we tried (E at 5 was rejected twice), so position 5 is **not E**.
4. Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, T, N, L, I, C, U, D.
5. Remaining letters still available: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus any vowels not yet tested (none left except the single E already placed).

Therefore the pattern is:
S _ E _ _

We need a valid 5-letter English word conforming to S _ E _ _ that uses only the still-allowed letters for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s scan common S _ E _ _ words:

- SHELF – F and L: L is eliminated → invalid
- SHERE – R eliminated → invalid
- SHREW – W still allowed, H still allowed → valid
- SMEAR – A and R eliminated → invalid
- SMERK – K still allowed, but “smerk” is not a recognized word
- SPERM – P, M still allowed → valid word
- SWEPT – T eliminated → invalid
- SWELL – L eliminated → invalid
- SWEET – T eliminated → invalid
- SWEEP – P still allowed → valid word

Among the valid candidates (SHREW, SPERM, SWEEP), SHREW is the most neutral, testing H and W—neither of which has been used yet—so it brings maximal new information.

A common strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that uses a variety of frequently occurring letters. This helps gather maximum information early. \n\nGood choices often include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is a classic first guess because it contains five unique, common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words.

A word like “STEIN” would reuse S and E in new spots and add T, I, N—none of which have been ruled out yet. However, checking quickly: STEIN uses S in position 1 (same as AROSE’s position 4 for S), so S might still be misplaced here. \n\nA better choice is “TENSE”: it keeps E in a new position (2 or 4), moves S to a new spot (1 or 5), and adds T, N—both high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet.
