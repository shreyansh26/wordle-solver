For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. Common starting strategies include words with high-frequency letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good first guess should include a mix of vowels and consonants to test both types. 

Some popular first guesses are words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which gives good coverage across common letters.

Next, I want to test other common letters that weren’t tried yet: T, O, N, L, D, U, C, etc. A good second-guess word that meets these criteria and uses mostly new letters is “UNITE”.

Let me verify:
- It has E (not at the end).  
- Uses U, N, I, T, E – but I was already ruled out, so scratch that.  

Another option: “TONEY” (but Y is less common).  

A better choice: “DONUT” – but it doesn’t have E.  

How about “OCEAN”?  
- O: new  
- C: new  
- E: confirmed in word (good)  
- A: already ruled out – so no good.  

Try “ELUDE” next? But E is already known, and L, U, D are new.  

However, E could be in position 2, 3, or 4. To maximize info, I’ll pick a word with E in a new spot and fresh consonants.  

A great candidate: “ELBOW”  
- E: moves to position 1 (new spot)  
- L, B, O, W: all new letters and common enough  

I’ll go with this to test E in position 1 and gather info on L, B, O, W.

Current facts about the secret word:
1. It contains the letter E, and E is in position 1 (feedback: E✓).
2. It does NOT contain: R, A, I, S, L, B, W.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (feedback: O-).
4. All other letters tested so far (E, L, B, O, W) have been placed or eliminated.

Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z plus O (which must appear somewhere other than position 4).

Structure so far: E _ _ _ _

Since O must appear and cannot be in position 4, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

I need a new word that:
- Starts with E.
- Contains O in a new spot (not position 4).
- Uses all-new consonants (none of R, A, I, S, L, B, W).

Good consonants to test next: N, T, C, D, G, H, K, M, P.

A word that satisfies these constraints is E N O T E, but E is already in position 1 and repeating it in position 5 might not give new info. Another option: E N O C H – but that uses H and C which are fine.

However, the simplest word that uses O in a new spot and tests new consonants is E N T O N – but that repeats N.

Let me pick E N O T E (ENOTE):
- E is already known at position 1, so position 5 being E is allowed (dupes are okay).
- N, T are new consonants.
- O is in position 3 (new spot).

But ENOTE isn't a common word. A better valid word is E N O C H (ENOCH), but that might be a proper noun.

- O: new  
- C: new  
- E: confirmed in word (good)  
- A: already ruled out – so no good.  

Try “ELUDE” next? But E is already known, and L, U, D are new.  

However, E could be in position 2, 3, or 4. To maximize info, I’ll pick a word with E in a new spot and fresh consonants.  

A great candidate: “ELBOW”  
- E: moves to position 1 (new spot)  
- L, B, O, W: all new letters and common enough  

I’ll go with this to test E in position 1 and gather info on L, B, O, W.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts about the secret word:
1. It contains the letter E, and E is in position 1 (feedback: E✓).
2. It does NOT contain: R, A, I, S, L, B, W.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (feedback: O-).
4. All other letters tested so far (E, L, B, O, W) have been placed or eliminated.

Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z plus O (which must appear somewhere other than position 4).

Structure so far: E _ _ _ _

Since O must appear and cannot be in position 4, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

I need a new word that:
- Starts with E.
- Contains O in a new spot (not position 4).
- Uses all-new consonants (none of R, A, I, S, L, B, W).

Good consonants to test next: N, T, C, D, G, H, K, M, P.

A word that satisfies these constraints is E N O T E, but E is already in position 1 and repeating it in position 5 might not give new info. Another option: E N O C H – but that uses H and C which are fine.

However, the simplest word that uses O in a new spot and tests new consonants is E N T O N – but that repeats N.

Let me pick E N O T E (ENOTE):
- E is already known at position 1, so position 5 being E is allowed (dupes are okay).
- N, T are new consonants.
- O is in position 3 (new spot).

But ENOTE isn't a common word. A better valid word is E N O C H (ENOCH), but that might be a proper noun. 

Another valid word: E N O T E is not standard. How about E N T O Y (ENTOY)? Also not standard.

Actually, let me choose E N O T E is not valid. Let me pick E N O C T (ENOCT) – also not standard.

I need a valid English 5-letter word starting with E and avoiding R, A, I, S, L, B, W.

Valid options: E N T E R – but R is excluded. E N T E R is invalid.

E N T E R is out (R). E N T E R is invalid.

Looking for valid words:
- E N T E R – invalid (R).
- E N T E L – invalid.
- E N T E A – invalid.
- E N T E C – invalid.
- E N T E X – invalid.

Let me try E N T E M – invalid.

Another approach: use O in position 2. Then word is E O _ _ _. 

Possible words: E O N E T – not standard. E O M E T – not standard.

E N O D E (ENODE) – not standard. E N O T E – not standard.

Actually, E N O T E is not valid. Let me pick E N O C T – not standard.

I need to pick a valid word. Let me use E M O T E (EMOTE):
- E is in position 1 (confirmed).
- M, T are new consonants.
- O is in position 2 (new spot).
- E at position 5 is allowed even if it's a repeat.

EMOTE is a valid word and fits all constraints.
