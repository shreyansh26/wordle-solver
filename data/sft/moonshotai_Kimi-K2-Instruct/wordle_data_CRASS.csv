Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are A, E, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. Some optimal starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""RAISE"" (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give us good coverage across possible words.

From the feedback:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the correct position (position 2).  
- O is not in the word.  
- S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is not in the word.  

So we know:  
- _ R _ _ _  (fixed: R in second spot)  
- Must contain A and S elsewhere.  
- Must not contain O or E anywhere.  
- A cannot be first.  

Good candidate letters to use next: A, S, plus common remaining letters like I, T, N, L, D, U, etc.  
We also want to test new letters while respecting the constraints above.

A strong second guess: ""BRISK""  
- B is new and common.  
- R is already confirmed correct in position 2.  
- I is new and common.  
- S is known to be in the word, we test it in position 4 (but position 4 was marked wrong earlier, so let's adjust).  

Better: ""CRISP""  
- C is new.  
- R correct in position 2.

From the new feedback on TRAMS:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word  
- R(✓) → R is in the correct spot (position 2) — already known  
- A(✓) → A is in the correct spot (position 3)  
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- S(✓) → S is in the correct spot (position 5)  

So now we know the exact pattern:

_ R A _ S   (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed)

Letters used so far:
- Present and placed: R, A, S  
- Absent: O, E, T, M  

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding the absent letters and using only valid English letters.

Good candidate letters remaining (common and not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y  

Let’s pick plausible combinations:
- Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.  
- Position 4: same pool, must form a valid word ending in “R A _ S”.

Possible words fitting this pattern:
- BRASS → but A is already fixed in position 3, so this would require A in 3 and 4? No, BRASS is B-R-A-S-S → invalid because S is already fixed at 5, but second S would not fit.  
- CRASS → same issue with double S.  
- DRABS → but B in 4, S fixed in 5, but A is in 3, so D-R-A-B-S → valid 5-letter word.  
- FRASS → same S issue.  
- GRASP → S is at 4 in GRASP, but we know S is at 5, so invalid.  
- GRAYS → G-R-A-Y-S → fits perfectly: G(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5).  

GRAYS is valid and tests new letters G and Y.  

Alternatively, DRABS is also valid. Between these, GRAYS is more likely as it uses Y which is less common but still plausible.

I’ll go with GRAYS.

- BRASS → but A is already fixed in position 3, so this would require A in 3 and 4? No, BRASS is B-R-A-S-S → invalid because S is already fixed at 5, but second S would not fit.  
- CRASS → same issue with double S.  
- DRABS → but B in 4, S fixed in 5, but A is in 3, so D-R-A-B-S → valid 5-letter word.  
- FRASS → same S issue.  
- GRASP → S is at 4 in GRASP, but we know S is at 5, so invalid.  
- GRAYS → G-R-A-Y-S → fits perfectly: G(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5).  

GRAYS is valid and tests new letters G and Y.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are A, E, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. Some optimal starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""RAISE"" (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give us good coverage across possible words.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the correct position (position 2).  
- O is not in the word.  
- S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is not in the word.  

So we know:  
- _ R _ _ _  (fixed: R in second spot)  
- Must contain A and S elsewhere.  
- Must not contain O or E anywhere.  
- A cannot be first.  

Good candidate letters to use next: A, S, plus common remaining letters like I, T, N, L, D, U, etc.  
We also want to test new letters while respecting the constraints above.

A strong second guess: ""BRISK""  
- B is new and common.  
- R is already confirmed correct in position 2.  
- I is new and common.  
- S is known to be in the word, we test it in position 4 (but position 4 was marked wrong earlier, so let's adjust).  

Better: ""CRISP""  
- C is new.  
- R correct in position 2.  
- I new.  
- S known in word, test in position 3.  
- P new.

Another: ""DRAIN""  
- D new.  
- R correct in position 2.  
- A known in word, test in position 3.  
- I new.  
- N new.

But ""A"" cannot be in position 1, and we have it in position 3 now.  
Also ""S"" must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,5.

Let's try ""TRASH"":  
- T new.  
- R correct.  
- A known, test in 3.  
- S known, test in 4 (but 4 was wrong). Oops.

Best seems ""DRAIS"" but it's not a valid word.  
Valid option: ""GRASP""  
- G new.  
- R fixed.  
- A known, test in 3.  
- S known, test in 4 (but 4 was wrong).  

""CRASS"" repeats S.  
""FRASS"" not ideal.  

Let's use ""TRUSS"": S in 5 is new, but repeats S.  
""CRUST"": S in 4 was wrong, so bad.  

Good candidate: ""URSAE"" - but E is invalid.  

Recap:  
- _ R _ _ _  
- Must have A (not position 1) and S (not position 4).  
- Avoid O, E.  

Valid word: ""GRASP"" is no good (S in 4).  
""FRISK"" - S in 4 again.  
""TRAMS"" - S in 5 is new, A in 3 is new.  

""TRAMS"":  
- T new.  
- R fixed.  
- A test in 3.  
- M new.  
- S test in 5.  

This tests new letters while respecting constraints.

Guess 2: TRAMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TRAMS:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word

- A(✓) → A is in the correct spot (position 3)  
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- S(✓) → S is in the correct spot (position 5)  

So now we know the exact pattern:

_ R A _ S   (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed)

Letters used so far:
- Present and placed: R, A, S  
- Absent: O, E, T, M  

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding the absent letters and using only valid English letters.

Good candidate letters remaining (common and not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y  

Let’s pick plausible combinations:
- Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.  
- Position 4: same pool, must form a valid word ending in “R A _ S”.

Possible words fitting this pattern:
- BRASS → but A is already fixed in position 3, so this would require A in 3 and 4? No, BRASS is B-R-A-S-S → invalid because S is already fixed at 5, but second S would not fit.  
- CRASS → same issue with double S.  
- DRABS → but B in 4, S fixed in 5, but A is in 3, so D-R-A-B-S → valid 5-letter word.

- GRASP → S is at 4 in GRASP, but we know S is at 5, so invalid.  
- GRAYS → G-R-A-Y-S → fits perfectly: G(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5).  

GRAYS is valid and tests new letters G and Y.  

Alternatively, DRABS is also valid. Between these, GRAYS is more likely as it uses Y which is less common but still plausible.

I’ll go with GRAYS.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words matching the pattern _ R A _ S:

- BRASS → invalid (double S and S is already at 5)
- CRASS → invalid (double S)
- DRABS → D R A B S → uses D and B (both still possible)
- FRASS → invalid (double S)
- PRANK → pattern mismatch
- TRASH → T is excluded
- CRAMS → M is excluded
- BRADS → D R A D S → double D, invalid
- BRANS → B R A N S → uses B and N (both still possible)
- DRAPS → not a valid word
- FRAPS → not a valid word
- KRANS → valid (S African currency) but obscure
- PRAMS → M is excluded
- CRANS → C R A N S → uses C and N (both still possible)

The best remaining common words are:
- DRABS
- BRANS
- CRANS

Between these, ""DRABS"" and ""BRANS"" are more common.  
I'll choose ""DRABS"" first as it tests D and B.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are A, E, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters. Some optimal starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""RAISE"" (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give us good coverage across possible words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the correct position (position 2).  
- O is not in the word.  
- S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is not in the word.  

So we know:  
- _ R _ _ _  (fixed: R in second spot)  
- Must contain A and S elsewhere.  
- Must not contain O or E anywhere.  
- A cannot be first.  

Good candidate letters to use next: A, S, plus common remaining letters like I, T, N, L, D, U, etc.  
We also want to test new letters while respecting the constraints above.

A strong second guess: ""BRISK""  
- B is new and common.  
- R is already confirmed correct in position 2.  
- I is new and common.  
- S is known to be in the word, we test it in position 4 (but position 4 was marked wrong earlier, so let's adjust).  

Better: ""CRISP""  
- C is new.  
- R correct in position 2.  
- I new.  
- S known in word, test in position 3.  
- P new.

Another: ""DRAIN""  
- D new.  
- R correct in position 2.  
- A known in word, test in position 3.  
- I new.  
- N new.

But ""A"" cannot be in position 1, and we have it in position 3 now.  
Also ""S"" must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,5.

Let's try ""TRASH"":  
- T new.  
- R correct.  
- A known, test in 3.  
- S known, test in 4 (but 4 was wrong). Oops.

Best seems ""DRAIS"" but it's not a valid word.  
Valid option: ""GRASP""  
- G new.  
- R fixed.  
- A known, test in 3.  
- S known, test in 4 (but 4 was wrong).  

""CRASS"" repeats S.  
""FRASS"" not ideal.  

Let's use ""TRUSS"": S in 5 is new, but repeats S.  
""CRUST"": S in 4 was wrong, so bad.  

Good candidate: ""URSAE"" - but E is invalid.  

Recap:  
- _ R _ _ _  
- Must have A (not position 1) and S (not position 4).  
- Avoid O, E.  

Valid word: ""GRASP"" is no good (S in 4).  
""FRISK"" - S in 4 again.  
""TRAMS"" - S in 5 is new, A in 3 is new.  

""TRAMS"":  
- T new.  
- R fixed.  
- A test in 3.  
- M new.  
- S test in 5.  

This tests new letters while respecting constraints.

<guess>TRAMS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TRAMS:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word  
- R(✓) → R is in the correct spot (position 2) — already known  
- A(✓) → A is in the correct spot (position 3)  
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- S(✓) → S is in the correct spot (position 5)  

So now we know the exact pattern:

_ R A _ S   (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed)

Letters used so far:
- Present and placed: R, A, S  
- Absent: O, E, T, M  

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding the absent letters and using only valid English letters.

Good candidate letters remaining (common and not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y  

Let’s pick plausible combinations:
- Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.  
- Position 4: same pool, must form a valid word ending in “R A _ S”.

Possible words fitting this pattern:
- BRASS → but A is already fixed in position 3, so this would require A in 3 and 4? No, BRASS is B-R-A-S-S → invalid because S is already fixed at 5, but second S would not fit.  
- CRASS → same issue with double S.  
- DRABS → but B in 4, S fixed in 5, but A is in 3, so D-R-A-B-S → valid 5-letter word.  
- FRASS → same S issue.  
- GRASP → S is at 4 in GRASP, but we know S is at 5, so invalid.  
- GRAYS → G-R-A-Y-S → fits perfectly: G(1), R(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5).  

GRAYS is valid and tests new letters G and Y.  

Alternatively, DRABS is also valid. Between these, GRAYS is more likely as it uses Y which is less common but still plausible.

I’ll go with GRAYS.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words matching the pattern _ R A _ S:

- BRASS → invalid (double S and S is already at 5)

- PRANK → pattern mismatch

The best remaining common words are:

Some optimal starting words include:\n- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)\n- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)\n- ""RAISE"" (contains R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give us good coverage across possible words.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:  \n- A is in the word but not in position 1.  \n- R is in the correct position (position 2).  \n- O is not in the word.  \n- S is in the word but not in position 4.  \n- E is not in the word.  \n\nSo we know:  \n- _ R _ _ _  (fixed: R in second spot)  \n- Must contain A and S elsewhere.  \n- Must not contain O or E anywhere.  \n- A cannot be first.  \n\nGood candidate letters to use next: A, S, plus common remaining letters like I, T, N, L, D, U, etc.  \nWe also want to test new letters while respecting the constraints above.\n\nA strong second guess: ""BRISK""  \n- B is new and common.  \n- R is already confirmed correct in position 2.  \n- I is new and common.  \n- S is known to be in the word, we test it in position 4 (but position 4 was marked wrong earlier, so let\'s adjust).  \n\nBetter: ""CRISP""  \n- C is new.  \n- R correct in position 2.  \n- I new.  \n- S known in word, test in position 3.  \n- P new.\n\nAnother: ""DRAIN""  \n- D new.  \n- R correct in position 2.  \n- A known in word, test in position 3.  \n- I new.  \n- N new.\n\nBut ""A"" cannot be in position 1, and we have it in position 3 now.  \nAlso ""S"" must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,5.\n\nLet\'s try ""TRASH"":  \n- T new.  \n- R correct.  \n- A known, test in 3.  \n- S known, test in 4 (but 4 was wrong).

From the new feedback:

- Pattern is now C R A _ S  
  – C ✓ at position 1  
  – R ✓ at position 2  
  – A ✓ at position 3  
  – S ✓ at position 5  

Only position 4 is still unknown.  
Letters already completely absent: O, E, T, M, G, Y, D, B, N.

That leaves valid, still-untested letters such as: F, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a single letter to fill position 4 so the word becomes C R A ? S.

- CRAKS – not standard  
- CRALS – not standard  
- CRAPS – P is still allowed
