For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to work with for elimination or confirmation.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word and in the correct third position (✓).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). It cannot be in position 2.
- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

Current partial word: S _ A _ _

We know:
1. The first letter is S.
2. The third letter is A.
3. L appears somewhere in the word, but not in the second position (so could be 4th or 5th).
4. T and E are excluded.
5. We still have positions 2 and 4 to fill (with position 5 possibly also open if L isn't there).

Good candidates:
- Focus on words with S, A, L in valid positions.
- Avoid T and E.
- Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, M, P, etc.

Possible words: SCALY, SNARL, SCAMP, SMALL, SPASM, etc.

""SNARL"" looks promising:
- S (correct position)
- N (new letter to test)

From the feedback so far:

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. A is correct in position 3.
3. L is correct in position 4 (SMALL gave L in position 4 a ✓).
   - The only remaining “-” for L (from earlier feedback) is now resolved; L is locked into position 4.
4. The second L in SMALL received a “-”, which tells us the word contains exactly one L (otherwise the second L would have been marked “x”).

So the current pattern is: S _ A L _

Letters still available (excluding T, E, N, R, M, L, the two L’s in SMALL confirming only one L exists, and any already used consonants):

Valid candidates for positions 2 and 5 (must avoid T, E, N, R, M):
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word. Candidates:

- SCALP (C in 2, P in 5)
- SCALL (invalid, repeats L in 5)
- SKALD (K in 2, D in 5)
- SPASM (invalid, repeats S)
- SCALY (Y in 5)
- SCAUP (U in 5, but P may be untested)
- SCAMP (invalid, repeats M)
- SCARF (invalid, R excluded)
- SCOWL (invalid, O and W untested but L already used)
- SCUBA (invalid, U and B untested but A already in 3)
- SCULK (invalid, K in 5)

“SCALY” seems solid:
- S ✓
- C in 2 (new test)
- A ✓
- L ✓
- Y in 5 (new test)

It’s a valid word and tests C and Y (both unused so far).
