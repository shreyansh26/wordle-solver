For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A classic choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes the most common vowels (A, O, E) and some common consonants (R, S). However, since I don't have any prior information, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong opening guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A – NOT in the word (x).  
2. R – in the word AND in the correct position (✓, so word is R _ _ _ _).  
3. O – NOT in the word (x).  
4. S – NOT in the word (x).  
5. E – in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So we know:
- The word starts with R.  
- E is somewhere in positions 2-5 (not 5).  
- No A, O, or S.  

Next, I want to test common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good second guess that fits R _ _ _ _ and avoids A, O, S is “RIDGE”. It places E in position 5 (still allowed), tests I, D, G, and keeps R fixed.

Let’s digest what we now know.

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   - R is in the word and already in the correct position (position 1).  
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not at position 5.

2. From Guess 2 (RIDGE):
   - The first letter was indeed R, but the feedback shows R(-).  
   - This tells us R is NOT in position 1.  Therefore R must appear somewhere else in the word, and there is a different letter in position 1.

3. Additional eliminations:
   - Letters completely ruled out so far: A, O, S, I, D, G.  
   - Letters confirmed to be present: R and E, but E is NOT in position 5 and R is NOT in position 1.

4. We need a 5-letter word that
   - Does NOT contain A, O, S, I, D, G.  
   - Contains both R and E, with  
        – R in positions 2-5  
        – E in positions 1-4  
   - Uses only remaining common consonants and vowels (e.g., N, T, L, C, U, Y, etc.).

A quick scan of word patterns shows that “ENTRY” satisfies every rule:
   - E is in position 1 (allowed).  
   - R is in position 4 (allowed).  
   - N, T, Y are still possible letters and not yet eliminated.  

Hence I will guess ENTRY.

   A concrete candidate is “CREPT” but P hasn’t been tested and T is known to exist.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A classic choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes the most common vowels (A, O, E) and some common consonants (R, S). However, since I don't have any prior information, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong opening guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A – NOT in the word (x).  
2. R – in the word AND in the correct position (✓, so word is R _ _ _ _).  
3. O – NOT in the word (x).  
4. S – NOT in the word (x).  
5. E – in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So we know:
- The word starts with R.  
- E is somewhere in positions 2-5 (not 5).  
- No A, O, or S.  

Next, I want to test common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good second guess that fits R _ _ _ _ and avoids A, O, S is “RIDGE”. It places E in position 5 (still allowed), tests I, D, G, and keeps R fixed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest what we now know.

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   - R is in the word and already in the correct position (position 1).  
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not at position 5.

2. From Guess 2 (RIDGE):
   - The first letter was indeed R, but the feedback shows R(-).  
   - This tells us R is NOT in position 1.  Therefore R must appear somewhere else in the word, and there is a different letter in position 1.

3. Additional eliminations:
   - Letters completely ruled out so far: A, O, S, I, D, G.  
   - Letters confirmed to be present: R and E, but E is NOT in position 5 and R is NOT in position 1.

4. We need a 5-letter word that
   - Does NOT contain A, O, S, I, D, G.  
   - Contains both R and E, with  
        – R in positions 2-5  
        – E in positions 1-4  
   - Uses only remaining common consonants and vowels (e.g., N, T, L, C, U, Y, etc.).

A quick scan of word patterns shows that “ENTRY” satisfies every rule:
   - E is in position 1 (allowed).  
   - R is in position 4 (allowed).  
   - N, T, Y are still possible letters and not yet eliminated.  

Hence I will guess ENTRY.

2. R(✓) → R is correct in position 2.  
3. E(✓) → E is correct in position 3.  
4. C(-) → C is in the word but not in position 4.  
5. K(x) → K is not in the word.

Current knowledge:

- Fixed pattern so far: _ R E _ _
- Letters known to be present: T, C (and we already have R and E placed).
- Positions still unknown: 1 and 5.
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, I, D, G, N, Y, K.

Remaining possible letters (excluding all ruled-out ones):
B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters, one for position 1 and one for position 5, chosen only from this remaining set, while ensuring the word uses every confirmed letter exactly as required.

The word structure is: ? R E ? ?  
with T and C still needing a home somewhere.

Since T must appear and cannot be in position 1, T must occupy position 4 or 5, but position 4 is currently occupied by C (which must also appear). So we have two cases:

Case 1: T in position 4, C in position 5:
   Word would be ? R E T C → need a valid 5-letter word. ""BRET C"" is not a word, ""FRET C"" isn’t, etc. No common word fits.

Case 2: C in position 4 (but C is misplaced, so cannot be in position 4 at all), so C must be in position 5 and T in position 4:
   Word becomes ? R E T C → again no standard word.

Realized my mis-step: C is misplaced from position 4, so C can only appear in positions 1, 3 (but 3 is E), or 5. Position 5 is allowed.

So valid placement must be:
   C in position 5, T in position 4 → word: ? R E T C  
   or T in position 4, C in position 5 → same.

Looking for actual dictionary words fitting _ R E T C gives none. Next recheck: I misread. C is misplaced from position 4, so C can be in 1, 2 (but 2 is R), 3 (E), or 5. Therefore C must be in 1 or 5.

So:

Option A:
   C in position 1 → C R E T _ . But position 5 needs a letter from remaining set (B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z) and must form a valid word. ""CRET _"" is not a root for any word.

Option B:
   C in position 5 → _ R E T C → ""BRET C"" – again not valid.

Realization: I missed that T must be somewhere, so positions are fixed as:

1: must be a consonant from allowed set  
2: R  
3: E  
4: must be C (since C cannot be in 4 yet needs to be placed, but feedback says C is misplaced from 4, so C CANNOT be in 4. Contradiction.)

Wait, feedback says C is misplaced from 4, meaning C is in the word but NOT in 4. So C must be in 5.

Thus positions:

1: any remaining consonant  
2: R (fixed)  
3: E (fixed)  
4: must be T (since T must be placed and position 4 is only remaining)  
5: must be C (since C must be placed and only position 5 is left)

So the word must be: ? R E T C.  
Check dictionary: only ""PRET C"" doesn’t exist, ""BRET C"" no, ""FRET C"" no, ""MRET C"" no...

Realized my error: T is misplaced from position 1, so T can be in positions 2,3,4,5. But positions 2 and 3 are R and E, so T must be in 4 or 5.

Simultaneously, C is misplaced from 4, so C must be in 1 or 5.

So two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1: C in 1, T in 4 → C R E T _  
Need a fifth letter at position 5 from remaining (B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z). Common valid word fitting: ""CRETE"" has E already used, ""CRET_"" only ""CREPT"" has P not yet tested. Check CREPT: uses E,R,T,P,C – P is allowed.

But ""CREPT"" has C in 1, R in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5. This uses T in 5 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), P untested. Let’s see if this fits constraints.

""CREPT"":
- C in 1 (allowed, not in 4).  
- R in 2 (matches ✓).  
- E in 3 (matches ✓).  
- T in 5 (allowed, since T is misplaced from 1).  
- P untested, but all constraints met.

CREPT seems valid. Let me verify:
Letters: C,R,E,P,T – all permitted positions.

Therefore next logical guess is CREPT.
