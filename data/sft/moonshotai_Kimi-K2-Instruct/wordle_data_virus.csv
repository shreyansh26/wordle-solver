For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior information, so I should choose a word that uses a variety of these common letters to help eliminate possibilities quickly.

A good strategy is to pick a word with:
- Multiple vowels to check their presence
- Common consonants to check their presence
- No repeating letters to maximize the information gained

Some good options include: ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also excellent with R, A, I, S, E. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes I which is also very common.

That leaves:
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so R ∈ {3,4}
- I must be in 4 or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so I = 4

Thus:

- Position 5 = S
- R must be in position 3

From Guess 3 (TRINS) we learned:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior information, so I should choose a word that uses a variety of these common letters to help eliminate possibilities quickly.

A good strategy is to pick a word with:
- Multiple vowels to check their presence
- Common consonants to check their presence
- No repeating letters to maximize the information gained

Some good options include: ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also excellent with R, A, I, S, E. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes I which is also very common.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: in the word but in the wrong position (was 1st, so R must be in 2-5)
- A: not in the word
- I: in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, so I must be in 1,2,4,5)
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (was 4th, so S must be in 1,2,3,5)
- E: not in the word

Thus the target word:
1. Contains the letters R, I, S once each (no A, no E)
2. R cannot be in 1st, I cannot be in 3rd, S cannot be in 4th.
3. Needs two more distinct letters (consonants or vowels) that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good candidates should avoid A and E, place R, I, S in allowable spots, and introduce fresh common letters.  
A strong choice is ""CRISP"":
- Uses R (allowed positions 2-5), I (allowed positions 1,2,4,5), S (allowed positions 1,2,3,5).
- Introduces C and P, two high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
- No repeats, covers new letters efficiently.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word (someplace):
R, I, S

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, E, C, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- I: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3
- S: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4

All three letters must still appear once each, and two new distinct letters are needed to complete the 5-letter word.

Because S can only be in position 5, let’s lock S there.

That leaves:
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so R ∈ {3,4}
- I must be in 4 or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so I = 4

Thus:
- Position 4 = I
- Position 5 = S
- R must be in position 3

So far we have: _ _ R I S

The first two positions need new letters that have not been tested yet and are not among {A,E,C,P}. Common untouched consonants include T, N, D, L, M, B, G, etc.

A high-frequency choice is T in position 1 and N in position 2, giving TRINS. (TRINS is valid; it’s a plural of trin, a Scottish variant of “trine” meaning a triad or trio.)

Let’s try TRINS.

Guess 3: TRINS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 3 (TRINS) we learned:
- S is now in the correct spot (position 5).  
- R, I, S are all present; R and I are still in wrong positions.

So far we have:
- 5th letter: S ✓
- R must be in 3rd or 4th (cannot be 1st, 2nd, 5th).
- I must be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th (cannot be 3rd, 5th).

Letters already ruled out: A, E, C, P, T, N.

We need two fresh letters for positions 1 and 2 (and possibly a third for position 3/4 if R or I takes the other).

Let’s tentatively place the I in position 2 and R in position 4:

 _  I  _  R  S

Positions 1 and 3 are still open. Good untested consonants: D, L, G, M, B, F, H, K.

Try D in 1st and L in 3rd: DRILS → invalid (double L/D issues → not ideal).  
Try B and L: BLIRS → invalid.  
Try G and L: GLIRS → invalid.  
Try D and G: D G I R S → DIRGS → invalid.  
Try F and L: FLIRS → invalid.  
Try M and L: MLIRS → invalid.  
Try H and L: HLIRS → invalid.

Next pattern: place I 1st and R 3rd, S 5th:

I _ R _ S

Positions 2 and 4 need two new distinct letters (not A,E,C,P,T,N). Try D in 2nd, L in 4th: I D R L S → IDRLS → invalid.

Try M in 2nd, L in 4th: I M R L S → IMRLS → invalid.

Try F in 2nd, L in 4th: I F R L S → IFRLS → invalid.

Try B in 2nd, L in 4th: I B R L S → IBRLS → invalid.

Hmm, let’s flip: R 3rd, I 4th:

_ _ R I S

Positions 1 and 2 need letters. Try B and L: B L R I S → BLRIS → invalid.

Try D and L: D L R I S → DLRIS → invalid.

We’re running out of obvious pairs. Let’s reconsider the placement.

Alternative: I in 4th, R in 3rd:

_ _ R I S

Positions 1 and 2 need letters. Try B and L: B L R I S → BLRIS → invalid.

Wait, we missed a simple pattern: I could be in 1st, R in 3rd, and we need two more letters:

I _ R _ S

Positions 2 and 4: Try B and G: I B R G S → IBRGS → invalid.

We’re stuck with this pattern. Let’s try a new arrangement: I in 2nd, R in 4th:

_ I _ R S

Try B and G: B I G R S → BIGRS → invalid.

Try L and G: L I G R S → LIGRS → invalid.

Try L and H: L I H R S → LIHRS → invalid.

Try M and D: M I D R S → MIDRS → invalid.

Try M and G: M I G R S → MIGRS → invalid.

Try M and H: M I H R S → MIHRS → invalid.

We’re clearly missing a valid word. Let’s list all possible permutations with R, I, S and two other unused letters (B,D,F,G,H,L,M) that are valid 5-letter English words.

Possible valid words:
- BRISK
- FRISK
- GRISK (invalid)
- PRISK (invalid, P excluded)
- DRISK (invalid)
- HRISK (invalid)
- LRISK (invalid)
- MRISK (invalid)
- BRIDS (invalid)
- FRIGS (invalid)
- FIRMS (invalid)
- FILMS (invalid)
- GIRLS (invalid)
- GIRDS (invalid)
- HIRDS (invalid)
- HIRLS (invalid)

Looking carefully, BRISK is the only valid word with R, I, S and two new letters. Let’s try BRISK.

BRISK contains:
- B (new)
- R (allowed: 2nd, 3rd, 4th; here 2nd)
- I (allowed: 1st, 2nd, 4th; here 3rd)
- S (allowed: 5th; here 5th ✓)
- K (new)

This fits all constraints.

So, the next guess is BRISK.

From the four guesses so far we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word (each must appear once):

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:

Positions already ruled out:
- S: cannot be 1,2,3,4 (from CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.  
  So the final pattern ends in “…S”.

- R: cannot be positions 1,2 (from RAISE, CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

- I: cannot be positions 1,2,3 (from CRISP, TRINS).  
  Therefore I must be in position 4.

Combining these:
- 4th letter = I
- 5th letter = S
- R must be in the 3rd position (since 4th is already I).

So we have: _  _  R  I  S

We still need two different letters for positions 1 and 2.  
They must be:
– distinct from each other  
– not any of the excluded letters: A,E,C,P,T,N,B,K  
– together with R,I,S they must form a valid 5-letter English word

Remaining eligible letters (alphabet minus the excluded set):
D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only remaining common 5-letter English word matching the constraints is:

Re-examining, we missed a valid pattern: “F R I S” plus an extra letter.  

Wait – with positions 1 and 2 unused, we can form:

F O R I S → FORIS (invalid)  
F L R I S → FLRIS (invalid)  
G L R I S → GLRIS (invalid)  
D I R I S → invalid (double I)  
D R I S … doesn’t fit.

Actually, the valid word is **FRIGS**?  
FRIGS: 5-letter, valid English (plural of frig), uses F,R,I,G,S.

Check constraints:
- Letters: F, R, I, G, S  
- All of R,I,S present  
- No A,E,C,P,T,N,B,K used  
- Positions:
  – R in 2nd (allowed: not 1,2 → wait, R is excluded from 2nd by feedback!  
    Previous feedback said R cannot be 2nd (CRISP).  
  So FRIGS places R in 2nd, which is forbidden. Hence invalid.

Next candidate: **DRIPS** – P excluded.  
**GRIPS** – P excluded.  
**WRIST** – T excluded.  
**GRIST** – T excluded.  
**FRISK** – K excluded.

We have exhausted obvious candidates.  
Re-checking valid 5-letter English words containing R, I, S exactly once each, with S last and I fourth:

Positions 1 and 2 need two distinct letters, not in the excluded set.

List: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid word is **HORIS**?  – invalid.  
**LORIS** – yes, “loris” is a 5-letter English word (slow loris).

Check letters: L, O, R, I, S  
- L and O are both not yet excluded.  
- Pattern: L O R I S  
  – S in 5th ✓  
  – I in 4th ✓

All constraints satisfied.

So, the next logical guess is LORIS.

Positions already ruled out:
- S: cannot be 1,2,3,4 (from CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.  
  So the final pattern ends in “…S”.

- R: cannot be positions 1,2 (from RAISE, CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,virus,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior information, so I should choose a word that uses a variety of these common letters to help eliminate possibilities quickly.

A good strategy is to pick a word with:
- Multiple vowels to check their presence
- Common consonants to check their presence
- No repeating letters to maximize the information gained

Some good options include: ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also excellent with R, A, I, S, E. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes I which is also very common.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: in the word but in the wrong position (was 1st, so R must be in 2-5)
- A: not in the word
- I: in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, so I must be in 1,2,4,5)
- S: in the word but in the wrong position (was 4th, so S must be in 1,2,3,5)
- E: not in the word

Thus the target word:
1. Contains the letters R, I, S once each (no A, no E)
2. R cannot be in 1st, I cannot be in 3rd, S cannot be in 4th.
3. Needs two more distinct letters (consonants or vowels) that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good candidates should avoid A and E, place R, I, S in allowable spots, and introduce fresh common letters.  
A strong choice is ""CRISP"":
- Uses R (allowed positions 2-5), I (allowed positions 1,2,4,5), S (allowed positions 1,2,3,5).
- Introduces C and P, two high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
- No repeats, covers new letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) I(-) S(-) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word (someplace):
R, I, S

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, E, C, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- I: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3
- S: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4

All three letters must still appear once each, and two new distinct letters are needed to complete the 5-letter word.

Because S can only be in position 5, let’s lock S there.

That leaves:
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so R ∈ {3,4}
- I must be in 4 or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so I = 4

Thus:
- Position 4 = I
- Position 5 = S
- R must be in position 3

So far we have: _ _ R I S

The first two positions need new letters that have not been tested yet and are not among {A,E,C,P}. Common untouched consonants include T, N, D, L, M, B, G, etc.

A high-frequency choice is T in position 1 and N in position 2, giving TRINS. (TRINS is valid; it’s a plural of trin, a Scottish variant of “trine” meaning a triad or trio.)

Let’s try TRINS.

<guess>TRINS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: TRINS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 3 (TRINS) we learned:
- S is now in the correct spot (position 5).  
- R, I, S are all present; R and I are still in wrong positions.

So far we have:
- 5th letter: S ✓
- R must be in 3rd or 4th (cannot be 1st, 2nd, 5th).
- I must be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th (cannot be 3rd, 5th).

Letters already ruled out: A, E, C, P, T, N.

We need two fresh letters for positions 1 and 2 (and possibly a third for position 3/4 if R or I takes the other).

Let’s tentatively place the I in position 2 and R in position 4:

 _  I  _  R  S

Positions 1 and 3 are still open. Good untested consonants: D, L, G, M, B, F, H, K.

Try D in 1st and L in 3rd: DRILS → invalid (double L/D issues → not ideal).  
Try B and L: BLIRS → invalid.  
Try G and L: GLIRS → invalid.  
Try D and G: D G I R S → DIRGS → invalid.  
Try F and L: FLIRS → invalid.  
Try M and L: MLIRS → invalid.  
Try H and L: HLIRS → invalid.

Next pattern: place I 1st and R 3rd, S 5th:

I _ R _ S

Positions 2 and 4 need two new distinct letters (not A,E,C,P,T,N). Try D in 2nd, L in 4th: I D R L S → IDRLS → invalid.

Try M in 2nd, L in 4th: I M R L S → IMRLS → invalid.

Try F in 2nd, L in 4th: I F R L S → IFRLS → invalid.

Try B in 2nd, L in 4th: I B R L S → IBRLS → invalid.

Hmm, let’s flip: R 3rd, I 4th:

_ _ R I S

Try D and L: D L R I S → DLRIS → invalid.

We’re running out of obvious pairs. Let’s reconsider the placement.

Alternative: I in 4th, R in 3rd:

_ _ R I S

Positions 1 and 2 need letters. Try B and L: B L R I S → BLRIS → invalid.

Wait, we missed a simple pattern: I could be in 1st, R in 3rd, and we need two more letters:

I _ R _ S

Try M and D: M I D R S → MIDRS → invalid.

Try M and G: M I G R S → MIGRS → invalid.

Try M and H: M I H R S → MIHRS → invalid.

We’re clearly missing a valid word. Let’s list all possible permutations with R, I, S and two other unused letters (B,D,F,G,H,L,M) that are valid 5-letter English words.

Possible valid words:
- BRISK
- FRISK
- GRISK (invalid)
- PRISK (invalid, P excluded)
- DRISK (invalid)
- HRISK (invalid)
- LRISK (invalid)
- MRISK (invalid)
- BRIDS (invalid)
- FRIGS (invalid)
- FIRMS (invalid)
- FILMS (invalid)
- GIRLS (invalid)
- GIRDS (invalid)
- HIRDS (invalid)
- HIRLS (invalid)

Looking carefully, BRISK is the only valid word with R, I, S and two new letters. Let’s try BRISK.

BRISK contains:
- B (new)
- R (allowed: 2nd, 3rd, 4th; here 2nd)
- I (allowed: 1st, 2nd, 4th; here 3rd)
- S (allowed: 5th; here 5th ✓)
- K (new)

This fits all constraints.

So, the next guess is BRISK.

<guess>BRISK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) I(-) S(-) P(x)
Guess 3: TRINS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) I(-) S(-) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the four guesses so far we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word (each must appear once):
R, I, S

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, E, C, P, T, N, B, K

Positions already ruled out:
- S: cannot be 1,2,3,4 (from CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.  
  So the final pattern ends in “…S”.

- R: cannot be positions 1,2 (from RAISE, CRISP, TRINS, BRISK).  
  Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

- I: cannot be positions 1,2,3 (from CRISP, TRINS).  
  Therefore I must be in position 4.

Combining these:
- 4th letter = I
- 5th letter = S
- R must be in the 3rd position (since 4th is already I).

So we have: _  _  R  I  S

We still need two different letters for positions 1 and 2.  
They must be:
– distinct from each other  
– not any of the excluded letters: A,E,C,P,T,N,B,K  
– together with R,I,S they must form a valid 5-letter English word

Remaining eligible letters (alphabet minus the excluded set):
D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Scanning common words ending in “RIS”:
- F + R + I + S → FRISK (but K is excluded)  
- G + R + I + S → GRIST (invalid, ends in T, T excluded)  
- H + R + I + S → HRI… (no common word)  
- D + R + I + S → DRIS… (no common word)  
- L + R + I + S → LRIS… (no)  
- M + R + I + S → MRIS… (no)

- W + R + I + S → WRIST (but T is excluded)  
- V + R + I + S → VRIS… (no)  
- F + L + R + I + S → FLIR… (no)

The only remaining common 5-letter English word matching the constraints is:

D R I S … – but we need two leading letters and R is already fixed to 3rd.  
Re-examining, we missed a valid pattern: “F R I S” plus an extra letter.  

Wait – with positions 1 and 2 unused, we can form:

F O R I S → FORIS (invalid)  
F L R I S → FLRIS (invalid)  
G L R I S → GLRIS (invalid)  
D I R I S → invalid (double I)  
D R I S … doesn’t fit.

Actually, the valid word is **FRIGS**?  
FRIGS: 5-letter, valid English (plural of frig), uses F,R,I,G,S.

Check constraints:
- Letters: F, R, I, G, S  
- All of R,I,S present  
- No A,E,C,P,T,N,B,K used  
- Positions:
  – R in 2nd (allowed: not 1,2 → wait, R is excluded from 2nd by feedback!  
    Previous feedback said R cannot be 2nd (CRISP).  
  So FRIGS places R in 2nd, which is forbidden. Hence invalid.

Next candidate: **DRIPS** – P excluded.  
**GRIPS** – P excluded.  
**WRIST** – T excluded.  
**GRIST** – T excluded.  
**FRISK** – K excluded.

We have exhausted obvious candidates.

- L and O are both not yet excluded.  
- Pattern: L O R I S  
  – S in 5th ✓  
  – I in 4th ✓  
  – R in 3rd ✓  
  – letters L,O not in exclusion list.

All constraints satisfied.

So, the next logical guess is LORIS.

Since this is the first guess, I don\'t have any prior information, so I should choose a word that uses a variety of these common letters to help eliminate possibilities quickly.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word with:\n- Multiple vowels to check their presence\n- Common consonants to check their presence\n- No repeating letters to maximize the information gained\n\nSome good options include: ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also excellent with R, A, I, S, E.
