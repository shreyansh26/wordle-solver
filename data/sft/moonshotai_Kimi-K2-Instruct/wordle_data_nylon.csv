For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify possible vowels and consonants in the target word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, and common consonants.

Some good candidates would be words like:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, I'll choose CRANE because it includes C (which is somewhat common), R, A, N (common consonant), and E (the most common vowel). This should give me good information about both vowels and consonants in the word.

The feedback from CRANE tells us:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-); it was in position 4, so it must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 4).

Letters remaining to try should include common ones like S, T, I, O, U, L, D, etc.

Let me think of a word meeting these constraints. For example:
- STONE: contains S, T, O, N, E — but E is out.
- SOUND: contains S, O, U, N, D — looks good: no forbidden letters, N is in position 4 (but we know N can’t be in 4). So this is invalid.
- BONUS: B, O, N, U, S — N is in position 3, no forbidden letters. This seems valid.
- TUNIC: T, U, N, I, C — but C is out.

So far we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ N appears in the target word but is **not** in position 4.

2. LUNGS → L(-) U(x) N(-) G(x) S(x)  
   ⇒ N appears again but is **not** in position 3 either.  
   ⇒ L appears in wrong position (so L is in the word, but not in position 1).

Letters we now **know are in the target word**: N, L  
Letters we now **know are NOT in the target word**: C, R, A, E, U, G, S  

Positions ruled out so far:  
- N is not in 3 or 4.  
- L is not in 1.

That leaves the possible positions for N as 1, 2, or 5.  
L could be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We still need three more letters. From the unused common consonants and vowels, we have:  
Consonants left: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O (since A, E, U are out)

It’s usually productive to try to place known letters early and surround them with new common letters. Let’s put N in position 1 and see if we can build a plausible word with L somewhere (not 1).

A quick run-through:  
- N L _ _ _ → NL??? (words like “NL” don’t start with N)  
- N _ L _ _ → N L in 1 and 3  
- N _ _ L _ → N in 1, L in 4  
- N _ _ _ L → N in 1, L in 5  

Let’s pick N _ L _ _ (N in 1, L in 3). We still need positions 2, 4, 5 with allowed letters.  
Common consonants left: T, D, M, B, etc.  
Vowels left: I, O.

Try “N T I L D” – no, that’s not a word.  
Try “N I L T Y” – not a word.  
Try “N I L O T” – no.  
Try “N I L D O” – no.

Try N in position 2 and L in 3: _ N L _ _  
We need a consonant that can start a word with N second: common choices are D, B, M, etc.

Let’s try “B N L I T” – not a word.  
Try “T N L I M” – not a word.

Try N in position 5: _ _ _ _ N  
Then L can be in 2,3, or 4.  
Try “B I L D N” – BILDN? No.

Try N in position 2: _ N _ _ _  
And L in 3: _ N L _ _  
We need a consonant at 1 and vowels/consonants at 4-5.  
Try “D N L I M” – not a word.  
Try “P I N L Y” – P in 1, I, N, L, Y. But we have L in 3, N in 2: P I N L Y doesn’t fit (N is in 2, L in 4: P I N L Y).  

Let me list some valid English 5-letter words using N and L but avoiding all excluded letters (C, R, A, E, U, G, S).  

Possible candidates:  
- BLIND – B, L, I, N, D. Contains B (unknown), L (must be in word), I (vowel), N (must be in word), D (unknown).  
- BLINK – but K is allowed, so maybe.  
- BLUNT – U is out.  
- FLINT – F, L, I, N, T. All letters not yet ruled out.  

FLINT looks perfect:  
Letters: F, L, I, N, T  
- F, I, T are new, not yet ruled out.  
- L is in the word (not in 1).  
- N is in the word (not in 3 or 4).  

Let’s verify positions:  
- F (unknown)  
- L is in position 2 – allowed.  
- I (unknown vowel)  
- N is in position 4 – wait, in CRANE, N was in 4 and marked “-”; in LUNGS, N was in 3 and marked “-”. So N **cannot** be in 3 or 4. Thus N in FLINT would be in 4, which is **excluded**!  

So FLINT is invalid.  

Next candidate: BLIND  
B, L, I, N, D  
Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). N in 4 is again excluded.  

Next: BLINK  
B, L, I, N, K  
N in 4 – excluded.  

Next: PLINY – P, L, I, N, Y. N in 4 – excluded.  

Now try N in position 1: N _ _ _ _  
Then L must be in 2,3,4, or 5.  
Try N L _ _ _ – NL??? No valid word.  
N _ L _ _ – N I L D Y – not a word.  
N _ _ L _ – N I T L E – not a word.  
N _ _ _ L – N I B L E – not a word.  

Try N in position 2: _ N _ _ _  
L somewhere else:  
- _ N L _ _ – T N L I P – not a word.  
- _ N _ L _ – B N I L D – not a word.  
- _ N _ _ L – P N I D L – not a word.  

Try N in position 5: _ _ _ _ N  
L in 2,3, or 4.  
- _ L _ _ N – B L I N D – again N in 5, L in 2. But BLIND has N in 4 – wait, no: B L I N D has N in 4 – excluded.  
- _ _ L _ N – B I L D N – no.  
- _ _ _ L N – B I D L N – no.  

Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter English words that must contain N and L, must not contain C, R, A, E, U, G, S, and must place N in 1,2, or 5, and L in 2,3,4, or 5 (not 1).

Scanning possibilities:  
- NYLON – N Y L O N – contains O (allowed), Y, L, N. N appears twice, but N is allowed. Positions: N(1), N(5). L is in 3. This satisfies all constraints!  
  - Letters: N, Y, L, O, N.  
  - No forbidden letters.  
  - N not in 3 or 4.  
  - L not in 1.  

NYLON seems valid. Let’s double-check:  
- Letters: N, Y, L, O, N – all allowed.  
- N in 1 and 5 – allowed (both positions 1 and 5 are open for N).  

Thus, NYLON is a plausible next guess.

- F, I, T are new, not yet ruled out.  
- L is in the word (not in 1).  
- N is in the word (not in 3 or 4).  

Let’s verify positions:  
- F (unknown)  
- L is in position 2 – allowed.  
- I (unknown vowel)  
- N is in position 4 – wait, in CRANE, N was in 4 and marked “-”; in LUNGS, N was in 3 and marked “-”. So N **cannot** be in 3 or 4. Thus N in FLINT would be in 4, which is **excluded**!  

So FLINT is invalid.  

Next candidate: BLIND  
B, L, I, N, D  
Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). N in 4 is again excluded.  

Next: BLINK  
B, L, I, N, K  
N in 4 – excluded.  

Next: PLINY – P, L, I, N, Y. N in 4 – excluded.  

Now try N in position 1: N _ _ _ _  
Then L must be in 2,3,4, or 5.  
Try N L _ _ _ – NL??? No valid word.  
N _ L _ _ – N I L D Y – not a word.  
N _ _ L _ – N I T L E – not a word.  
N _ _ _ L – N I B L E – not a word.  

Try N in position 2: _ N _ _ _  
L somewhere else:  
- _ N L _ _ – T N L I P – not a word.  
- _ N _ L _ – B N I L D – not a word.  
- _ N _ _ L – P N I D L – not a word.  

Try N in position 5: _ _ _ _ N  
L in 2,3, or 4.  
- _ L _ _ N – B L I N D – again N in 5, L in 2. But BLIND has N in 4 – wait, no: B L I N D has N in 4 – excluded.  
- _ _ L _ N – B I L D N – no.  
- _ _ _ L N – B I D L N – no.  

Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter English words that must contain N and L, must not contain C, R, A, E, U, G, S, and must place N in 1,2, or 5, and L in 2,3,4, or 5 (not 1).

Scanning possibilities:  
- NYLON – N Y L O N – contains O (allowed), Y, L, N. N appears twice, but N is allowed. Positions: N(1), N(5). L is in 3. This satisfies all constraints!  
  - Letters: N, Y, L, O, N.  
  - No forbidden letters.  
  - N not in 3 or 4.  
  - L not in 1.  

NYLON seems valid. Let’s double-check:  
- Letters: N, Y, L, O, N – all allowed.  
- N in 1 and 5 – allowed (both positions 1 and 5 are open for N).  

Thus, NYLON is a plausible next guess.",Guess 3: NYLON -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) Y(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
