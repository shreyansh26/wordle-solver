- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I'll build a word that uses several of these common letters. Some good starter words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with RAISE as it uses R, A, I, S, E - covering five very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:

- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- I(-) – I is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fifth position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So:
- The pattern is _ A _ _ _
- Must contain I and S somewhere else
- Must not contain R or E
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

Possible words:
- BASIN (B A S I N) – uses I and S, not in their original positions
- CABIN (C A B I N) – but lacks S
- BASIL – ends with L, but S is in the original position (5), which is invalid per feedback
- NAILS – but S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong
- AVISO – but O is not ruled out, but A is in position 2 here, which is valid. However, S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong.

Looking for words with A in position 2, and I and S elsewhere:

BASIN: B A S I N – I is in position 4 (originally 4), so that would be I(-) again, same feedback, but S is in position 3 (originally 5), so that would be S(-) again, but acceptable.

Another option: MARIS – but R is excluded.

JASID – but D is fine, but not common.

BASIN seems solid.

From both pieces of feedback we know:

1. The fixed information:
   - Position 2 is A.
   - R, M, D, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. The floating information:
   - I and S are both in the word, but not in the positions we previously tried:
        – I was tried in positions 3 (MAIDS) and 4 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 3 or 4.
        – S was tried in positions 1 (MAIDS) and 5 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 1 or 5.

3. Therefore the only remaining positions for I and S are:
   - I can go in position 1 or 5 (but position 5 is already ruled out for S, not for I)
   - S can only go in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - But position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Similarly, I must be in position 1 or 5.

4. Combining: pattern is _ A _ _ _, with:
   – One of positions 3 or 4 is S
   – One of positions 1 or 5 is I

5. Candidate words fitting these constraints:
   – S at 3, I at 1: I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
   – S at 3, I at 5: _ A S _ I  → BASIN?  B A S I N – but N is unchecked.  BASIN: B, A, S, I, N.
        – Letters: B, A, S, I, N
        – Positions: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
        – I in 4 (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.
   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A _ S _
        – Possible: I A N S Y?  Not a word.
        – I A N S _ → IANSA?  No.
        – I A P S ?  Not common.
        – I A G S ?  No.
   – S at 4, I at 5: _ A _ S I
        – C A S S I?  C A S S I – CASSI is a nickname for Cassidy but not standard.
        – B A S S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  LASSI is a yogurty drink, valid.
        – G A S S I?  No.

   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  Not found.
   – Ruled out BASIN.

6. Re-evaluate constraints:
   - Allowed letters: A, S, I, and any others except R, M, D, E.
   - I must be in 1 or 5.
   - S must be in 3 or 4.
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _

   So:
   – If I is in 1, pattern I A S _ _ or I A _ S _
        – I A S _ _  → I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
        – I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  → Not common.
   – If I is in 5, pattern _ A S _ I or _ A _ S I
        – _ A S _ I  → C A S I N?  C A S I N – CASIN?  Not valid.
        – _ A _ S I  → L A _ S I  → L A B S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  Already L A S S I – LASSI fits.
        – _ A _ S I  → F A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → V A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → N A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → B A _ S I  → B A L S I?  Not common.
        – _ A _ S I  → P A _ S I  → P A S S I?  PASSI – not standard.

7. LASSI is actually acceptable (a drink), but let’s verify:
   – L A S S I
   – Positions: L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), I(5)
   – S must not be in 3 (from MAIDS feedback, S is allowed in 3), but in MAIDS S was at 1 and got (-), so S can be in 3.  Here S is at 3 and 4 – but we only know at least one S must be in word.  The second S is extra.
   – I at 5 (valid, previously 3 and 4 tried)
   – S at 3 (valid, not tried before)
   – Letters: L, A, S, S, I – all allowed.

8. Another candidate: BASIS
   – B A S I S
   – B(1) (ok), A(2) (ok), S(3) (ok), I(4) (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.

9. Another: BASIL
   – B A S I L – I in 4 (invalid).  Reject.

10. Another: PASTI – but T is allowed?  No restriction on T.
    – P A S T I – I in 5 (ok), S in 3 (ok), T is new letter.
    – P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
    – All constraints satisfied.

Between LASSI and PASTI, PASTI is more common.

But let’s check PASTI:
- PASTI is a variant spelling of PASTY, but PASTI is valid (Scrabble word).
- Letters: P, A, S, T, I
- Positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
- I not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5)
- S not in 1 or 5 – ok (it’s in 3)
- No R, M, D, E – ok.

So PASTI is valid.

   – S at 3, I at 5: _ A S _ I  → BASIN?  B A S I N – but N is unchecked.  BASIN: B, A, S, I, N.
        – Letters: B, A, S, I, N
        – Positions: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
        – I in 4 (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.
   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A _ S _

        – G A S S I?  No.

   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  Not found.
   – Ruled out BASIN.

6. Re-evaluate constraints:
   - Allowed letters: A, S, I, and any others except R, M, D, E.
   - I must be in 1 or 5.
   - S must be in 3 or 4.
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _

   So:
   – If I is in 1, pattern I A S _ _ or I A _ S _
        – I A S _ _  → I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
        – I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  → Not common.
   – If I is in 5, pattern _ A S _ I or _ A _ S I
        – _ A S _ I  → C A S I N?  C A S I N – CASIN?  Not valid.
        – _ A _ S I  → L A _ S I  → L A B S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  Already L A S S I – LASSI fits.
        – _ A _ S I  → F A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → V A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → N A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → B A _ S I  → B A L S I?  Not common.
        – _ A _ S I  → P A _ S I  → P A S S I?  PASSI – not standard.

7. LASSI is actually acceptable (a drink), but let’s verify:
   – L A S S I
   – Positions: L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), I(5)
   – S must not be in 3 (from MAIDS feedback, S is allowed in 3), but in MAIDS S was at 1 and got (-), so S can be in 3.  Here S is at 3 and 4 – but we only know at least one S must be in word.  The second S is extra.
   – I at 5 (valid, previously 3 and 4 tried)
   – S at 3 (valid, not tried before)
   – Letters: L, A, S, S, I – all allowed.

8. Another candidate: BASIS
   – B A S I S
   – B(1) (ok), A(2) (ok), S(3) (ok), I(4) (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.

9. Another: BASIL
   – B A S I L – I in 4 (invalid).  Reject.

10. Another: PASTI – but T is allowed?  No restriction on T.
    – P A S T I – I in 5 (ok), S in 3 (ok), T is new letter.
    – P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
    – All constraints satisfied.

Between LASSI and PASTI, PASTI is more common.

But let’s check PASTI:
- PASTI is a variant spelling of PASTY, but PASTI is valid (Scrabble word).
- Letters: P, A, S, T, I
- Positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
- I not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5)
- S not in 1 or 5 – ok (it’s in 3)
- No R, M, D, E – ok.

So PASTI is valid.",Guess 3: PASTI -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x) I(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,BASIN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I'll build a word that uses several of these common letters. Some good starter words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with RAISE as it uses R, A, I, S, E - covering five very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- I(-) – I is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fifth position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So:
- The pattern is _ A _ _ _
- Must contain I and S somewhere else
- Must not contain R or E
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

Possible words:
- BASIN (B A S I N) – uses I and S, not in their original positions
- CABIN (C A B I N) – but lacks S
- BASIL – ends with L, but S is in the original position (5), which is invalid per feedback
- NAILS – but S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong
- AVISO – but O is not ruled out, but A is in position 2 here, which is valid. However, S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong.

Looking for words with A in position 2, and I and S elsewhere:

BASIN: B A S I N – I is in position 4 (originally 4), so that would be I(-) again, same feedback, but S is in position 3 (originally 5), so that would be S(-) again, but acceptable.

Another option: MARIS – but R is excluded.

JASID – but D is fine, but not common.

BASIN seems solid.

Another candidate: VAPID – but lacks S.

CAPIS – not a word.

GAMIN – lacks S.

MAIDS – A in position 2, M A I D S – I is in position 3 (originally 4), S is in position 5 (originally 5), so S would be (-), and I would be (-). This fits.

Between BASIN and MAIDS, both fit. MAIDS is more common.

Let's go with MAIDS.

<guess>MAIDS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: MAIDS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) I(-) D(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both pieces of feedback we know:

1. The fixed information:
   - Position 2 is A.
   - R, M, D, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. The floating information:
   - I and S are both in the word, but not in the positions we previously tried:
        – I was tried in positions 3 (MAIDS) and 4 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 3 or 4.
        – S was tried in positions 1 (MAIDS) and 5 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 1 or 5.

3. Therefore the only remaining positions for I and S are:
   - I can go in position 1 or 5 (but position 5 is already ruled out for S, not for I)
   - S can only go in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - But position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Similarly, I must be in position 1 or 5.

4. Combining: pattern is _ A _ _ _, with:
   – One of positions 3 or 4 is S
   – One of positions 1 or 5 is I

5. Candidate words fitting these constraints:
   – S at 3, I at 1: I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
   – S at 3, I at 5: _ A S _ I  → BASIN?  B A S I N – but N is unchecked.  BASIN: B, A, S, I, N.
        – Letters: B, A, S, I, N
        – Positions: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
        – I in 4 (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.
   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A _ S _
        – Possible: I A N S Y?  Not a word.
        – I A N S _ → IANSA?  No.
        – I A P S ?  Not common.
        – I A G S ?  No.
   – S at 4, I at 5: _ A _ S I
        – C A S S I?  C A S S I – CASSI is a nickname for Cassidy but not standard.
        – B A S S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  LASSI is a yogurty drink, valid.

   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  Not found.

   - Allowed letters: A, S, I, and any others except R, M, D, E.
   - I must be in 1 or 5.
   - S must be in 3 or 4.
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _

   So:
   – If I is in 1, pattern I A S _ _ or I A _ S _
        – I A S _ _  → I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
        – I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  → Not common.
   – If I is in 5, pattern _ A S _ I or _ A _ S I
        – _ A S _ I  → C A S I N?  C A S I N – CASIN?  Not valid.
        – _ A _ S I  → L A _ S I  → L A B S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  Already L A S S I – LASSI fits.
        – _ A _ S I  → F A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → V A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → N A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → B A _ S I  → B A L S I?  Not common.
        – _ A _ S I  → P A _ S I  → P A S S I?  PASSI – not standard.

7. LASSI is actually acceptable (a drink), but let’s verify:
   – L A S S I
   – Positions: L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), I(5)
   – S must not be in 3 (from MAIDS feedback, S is allowed in 3), but in MAIDS S was at 1 and got (-), so S can be in 3.  Here S is at 3 and 4 – but we only know at least one S must be in word.  The second S is extra.
   – I at 5 (valid, previously 3 and 4 tried)

   – Letters: L, A, S, S, I – all allowed.

9. Another: BASIL

10. Another: PASTI – but T is allowed?  No restriction on T.
    – P A S T I – I in 5 (ok), S in 3 (ok), T is new letter.
    – P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
    – All constraints satisfied.

Between LASSI and PASTI, PASTI is more common.

But let’s check PASTI:
- PASTI is a variant spelling of PASTY, but PASTI is valid (Scrabble word).
- Letters: P, A, S, T, I
- Positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
- I not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5)
- S not in 1 or 5 – ok (it’s in 3)
- No R, M, D, E – ok.

So PASTI is valid.

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. Fixed:
   - Position 2 = A
   - Position 3 = S (from PASTI feedback)

2. Eliminated letters: R, M, D, E, P, T  
   (all of them cannot appear anywhere)

3. Still floating:
   - I must be in the word, but cannot be in:
        – position 4 (tried in RAISE)
        – position 5 (tried in PASTI)
   Therefore I must be in position 1.

4. Last unknown position is 4.  
   Allowed letters: any not yet eliminated.  
   From the remaining alphabet (after removing R,M,D,E,P,T) we still have:
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   plus A, S, I already used.

5. So the word pattern is: I A S _ _
   - Position 4 must be a single letter from the allowed set.
   - Position 5 must be a single letter from the allowed set.

6. Quick scan of common English words:
   IAS??  No standard dictionary words there.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BASIN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I'll build a word that uses several of these common letters. Some good starter words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with RAISE as it uses R, A, I, S, E - covering five very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- I(-) – I is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fifth position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So:
- The pattern is _ A _ _ _
- Must contain I and S somewhere else
- Must not contain R or E
- Must be a valid 5-letter word

Possible words:
- BASIN (B A S I N) – uses I and S, not in their original positions
- CABIN (C A B I N) – but lacks S
- BASIL – ends with L, but S is in the original position (5), which is invalid per feedback
- NAILS – but S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong
- AVISO – but O is not ruled out, but A is in position 2 here, which is valid. However, S is in position 4 originally, so S in position 4 here would still be wrong.

Looking for words with A in position 2, and I and S elsewhere:

BASIN: B A S I N – I is in position 4 (originally 4), so that would be I(-) again, same feedback, but S is in position 3 (originally 5), so that would be S(-) again, but acceptable.

Another option: MARIS – but R is excluded.

JASID – but D is fine, but not common.

BASIN seems solid.

Another candidate: VAPID – but lacks S.

CAPIS – not a word.

GAMIN – lacks S.

MAIDS – A in position 2, M A I D S – I is in position 3 (originally 4), S is in position 5 (originally 5), so S would be (-), and I would be (-). This fits.

Between BASIN and MAIDS, both fit. MAIDS is more common.

Let's go with MAIDS.

<guess>MAIDS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: MAIDS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) I(-) D(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both pieces of feedback we know:

1. The fixed information:
   - Position 2 is A.
   - R, M, D, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. The floating information:
   - I and S are both in the word, but not in the positions we previously tried:
        – I was tried in positions 3 (MAIDS) and 4 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 3 or 4.
        – S was tried in positions 1 (MAIDS) and 5 (RAISE) → still must appear, but not in 1 or 5.

3. Therefore the only remaining positions for I and S are:
   - I can go in position 1 or 5 (but position 5 is already ruled out for S, not for I)
   - S can only go in position 2, 3, or 4.
   - But position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Similarly, I must be in position 1 or 5.

4. Combining: pattern is _ A _ _ _, with:
   – One of positions 3 or 4 is S
   – One of positions 1 or 5 is I

5. Candidate words fitting these constraints:
   – S at 3, I at 1: I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
   – S at 3, I at 5: _ A S _ I  → BASIN?  B A S I N – but N is unchecked.  BASIN: B, A, S, I, N.
        – Letters: B, A, S, I, N
        – Positions: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)
        – I in 4 (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.
   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A _ S _
        – Possible: I A N S Y?  Not a word.
        – I A N S _ → IANSA?  No.
        – I A P S ?  Not common.
        – I A G S ?  No.
   – S at 4, I at 5: _ A _ S I
        – C A S S I?  C A S S I – CASSI is a nickname for Cassidy but not standard.
        – B A S S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  LASSI is a yogurty drink, valid.
        – G A S S I?  No.

   – S at 4, I at 1: I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  Not found.
   – Ruled out BASIN.

6. Re-evaluate constraints:
   - Allowed letters: A, S, I, and any others except R, M, D, E.
   - I must be in 1 or 5.
   - S must be in 3 or 4.
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _

   So:
   – If I is in 1, pattern I A S _ _ or I A _ S _
        – I A S _ _  → I A S _ _  → IAST?  Not valid.
        – I A _ S _  → I A N S ?  → Not common.
   – If I is in 5, pattern _ A S _ I or _ A _ S I
        – _ A S _ I  → C A S I N?  C A S I N – CASIN?  Not valid.
        – _ A _ S I  → L A _ S I  → L A B S I?  No.
        – L A S S I?  Already L A S S I – LASSI fits.
        – _ A _ S I  → F A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → V A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → N A S S I?  No.
        – _ A _ S I  → B A _ S I  → B A L S I?  Not common.
        – _ A _ S I  → P A _ S I  → P A S S I?  PASSI – not standard.

7. LASSI is actually acceptable (a drink), but let’s verify:
   – L A S S I
   – Positions: L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), I(5)
   – S must not be in 3 (from MAIDS feedback, S is allowed in 3), but in MAIDS S was at 1 and got (-), so S can be in 3.  Here S is at 3 and 4 – but we only know at least one S must be in word.  The second S is extra.
   – I at 5 (valid, previously 3 and 4 tried)
   – S at 3 (valid, not tried before)
   – Letters: L, A, S, S, I – all allowed.

8. Another candidate: BASIS
   – B A S I S
   – B(1) (ok), A(2) (ok), S(3) (ok), I(4) (invalid, must not be 4).  Reject.

9. Another: BASIL
   – B A S I L – I in 4 (invalid).  Reject.

10. Another: PASTI – but T is allowed?  No restriction on T.
    – P A S T I – I in 5 (ok), S in 3 (ok), T is new letter.
    – P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
    – All constraints satisfied.

Between LASSI and PASTI, PASTI is more common.

But let’s check PASTI:
- PASTI is a variant spelling of PASTY, but PASTI is valid (Scrabble word).
- Letters: P, A, S, T, I
- Positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), I(5)
- I not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5)
- S not in 1 or 5 – ok (it’s in 3)
- No R, M, D, E – ok.

So PASTI is valid.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses:

1. **Fixed letters**  
   A is in position 2 (✓).

2. **Letters confirmed present**  
   - S is in the word and in position 3 (✓).
   - I is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

3. **Letters confirmed absent**  
   R, E, M, D, P, T are **not** in the word.

4. **Remaining positions**  
   Pattern so far: _ A S _ _  
   - Position 1: any allowed letter (not R, E, M, D, P, T)
   - Position 4: any allowed letter (not R, E, M, D, P, T)
   - Position 5: any allowed letter (not R, E, M, D, P, T)  
   - Additionally, I must appear in one of the remaining positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 2, 3).

5. **Possible letters**  
   From the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned letters, common remaining consonants include B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, V, W, Y, etc.

6. **Constructing candidate words**  
   - If I is in position 4: _ A S I _  
     Example: BASIN → B A S I N  
     - B is allowed (not banned), N is allowed.  
     - Check validity: BASIN is a valid English word.

   - If I is in position 5: _ A S _ I  
     Example: BASIS → B A S I S  
     - Valid word, but we must check if S in position 4 is allowed.  
     - From feedback, S was only confirmed in position 3 (✓), so S can appear elsewhere, but we need to ensure no conflict with prior feedback.  
     - However, in BASIS, S appears in 3 and 5, but the feedback only confirmed at least one S is in 3. This is acceptable.

   - If I is in position 1: I A S _ _  
     Example: IASIS → Not a valid English word.  
     Example: IASON → Not valid.  
     This seems less promising.

7. **Choosing the best candidate**  
   - **BASIN**:  
     - Letters: B, A, S, I, N  
     - Positions: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)  
     - I is in position 4 (valid per feedback), S in 3 (✓), no banned letters.  
     - This seems to fit all constraints perfectly.
