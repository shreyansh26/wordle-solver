For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N, L). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular, but since I can only choose one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked ‘x’, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

The consonants T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H and the vowels I, U are still untouched, so a word combining several of these is ideal.

Let’s summarize what we know so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L are all absent from the word (marked “x” or “-” in the feedback).
- The letter U is present somewhere in the word (marked “-” in the first position but not confirmed position).

So the secret word contains:
- The letter U (at least once, position unknown).
- No other letters from A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L.

Remaining common letters that have not been used yet include:
D, C, G, H, M, P, B, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (though some are rare).

Since we have 5 letters to fill and already know U is in the word, we need 4 more letters from the allowed set. To maximize information, we should pick letters that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet.

A good candidate word would therefore be:
- 5 letters long.
- Uses U (since we know it’s in the word).
- Uses other common letters from the remaining pool.

A strong choice is “DUMPY”:
- Contains U (which we know is in the word).
- Uses D, M, P, Y (none of which have been ruled out yet).
- All letters are fairly common and should provide good coverage for future guesses.

Another possible word could be “HUMID” but “DUMPY” seems slightly better due to the inclusion of more consonants.

I’ll go with “DUMPY”.

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D.
- Focus: we need a valid 5-letter word whose 2nd letter is U, 3rd is M, 4th is P, 5th is Y, and whose 1st letter is NOT any of the excluded letters.

Possible starts for position 1 (from the remaining alphabet) include B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

- BUMPY – valid word.
- CUMPY – not a standard word.
- FUMPY – non-standard.
- GUMPY – non-standard.
- HUMPY – valid (Australian English variant, but recognized in many dictionaries).
- J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z all give non-words.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N, L). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us the maximum chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also popular, but since I can only choose one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked ‘x’, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out a large chunk of common 5-letter words.  
I need a fresh set of common letters that weren’t used yet.  
The consonants T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H and the vowels I, U are still untouched, so a word combining several of these is ideal.

One of the highest-coverage remaining choices is “UNTIL”:  
- Letters U, N, T, I, L all unused so far.  
- Provides two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  
This should give maximal new information.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we know so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L are all absent from the word (marked “x” or “-” in the feedback).
- The letter U is present somewhere in the word (marked “-” in the first position but not confirmed position).

So the secret word contains:
- The letter U (at least once, position unknown).
- No other letters from A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L.

Remaining common letters that have not been used yet include:
D, C, G, H, M, P, B, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (though some are rare).

Since we have 5 letters to fill and already know U is in the word, we need 4 more letters from the allowed set. To maximize information, we should pick letters that are common and haven’t been ruled out yet.

A good candidate word would therefore be:
- 5 letters long.
- Uses U (since we know it’s in the word).
- Uses other common letters from the remaining pool.

A strong choice is “DUMPY”:
- Contains U (which we know is in the word).
- Uses D, M, P, Y (none of which have been ruled out yet).
- All letters are fairly common and should provide good coverage for future guesses.

Another possible word could be “HUMID” but “DUMPY” seems slightly better due to the inclusion of more consonants.

I’ll go with “DUMPY”.
