For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants, to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains all five of the most common English letters (E, A, R, O, S) in one word. This will give us a lot of information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Feedback so far:

- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are not yet known: T, I  

We now know the secret word contains both T and I, and the other three letters must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eight already excluded).

A good next guess should:
1. Place the confirmed letters T and I in new positions to test where they can fit.
2. Introduce as many new letters as possible from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try “ITCHY”.
- It reuses I and T.
- It places I in position 1 and T in position 3 (both moved from positions 4 and 2 in “until”).
- It introduces three brand-new letters: C, H, Y.

This should maximize information gain.

- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): T, I, H  
- H is confirmed in position 4 (✓ at slot 4 in guess 3).

B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the three confirmed letters T, I, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:

- uses only the still-allowed set of letters.

Possible candidates:

- MIGHT – uses M, I, G, H, T.  
- TIGHT – uses T, I, G, H, T (but T repeats; nothing forbids repeating letters, but let’s avoid it for now).

- Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are not yet known: T, I  

We now know the secret word contains both T and I, and the other three letters must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eight already excluded).

A good next guess should:
1. Place the confirmed letters T and I in new positions to test where they can fit.
2. Introduce as many new letters as possible from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try “ITCHY”.
- It reuses I and T.
- It places I in position 1 and T in position 3 (both moved from positions 4 and 2 in “until”).
- It introduces three brand-new letters: C, H, Y.

This should maximize information gain.

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): T, I, H  
- H is confirmed in position 4 (✓ at slot 4 in guess 3).

Thus the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ H _  
and must contain T and I somewhere among the remaining four slots.

Still-unused letters (alphabet minus the 10 known-out ones):  
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the three confirmed letters T, I, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has H in the 4th position,  
- uses both T and I in any of the other four positions,  
- uses only the still-allowed set of letters.

Possible candidates:  
- WIDTH – uses W, I, D, T, H (all allowed, H is 4th).  
- FIGHT – uses F, I, G, H, T (all allowed, H is 4th).  
- MIGHT – uses M, I, G, H, T.  
- TIGHT – uses T, I, G, H, T (but T repeats; nothing forbids repeating letters, but let’s avoid it for now).  

Among these, WIDTH introduces the new letters W and D while keeping the required T and I.  
So WIDTH looks like a strong next guess.

Let’s extract the new information from Guess 4:

width → W(✓) I(✓) D(x) T(-) H(-)

- W is now confirmed in position 1.
- I is now confirmed in position 2.
- D is not in the word.
- T is somewhere in the word, but not in the 4th position (since it got “-”).
- H is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position (since it got “-”).

So the pattern now is:

W I _ _ _

and the remaining letters to place are: T, H, plus one more letter that:
- hasn’t been ruled out yet (i.e., must be among B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z, since we’ve already eliminated A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y, D).

Also note:
- T cannot be in position 4 (from this feedback), and it can’t be in positions 1 or 2 (they’re already W and I respectively), so T must be in position 3 or 5.
- H cannot be in position 5 (from feedback), and it can’t be in positions 1 or 2, so H must be in position 3 or 4.

Therefore, the two unknown positions (3 and 4) must contain T and H in some order.

So the possible patterns are:
1. W I T H _
2. W I H T _

We need a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns.

For pattern 1 (WITH_): valid words include “WITHS”, “WITHY”, etc. “WITHS” is a valid 5-letter word.

For pattern 2 (WIHT_): valid words include “WIGHT”, which is a valid 5-letter word.

We can choose one of these. Let’s try “WIGHT” because it uses G (a new letter) in the 5th position.

So the guess is “WIGHT”.
