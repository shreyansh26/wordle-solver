For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 highly common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _
A must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
We need to avoid O, S, E entirely.

Good remaining letters (from popular Wordle-starting lists) that haven’t been ruled out: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, F, H, K, G, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Try A in a new position.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Candidate words:
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – but A is in position 3, which might be good. All letters are unused except R.
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – A in position 3.
- DRAIN (D, R, A, I, N) – A in position 3.

I'll go with TRAIN as it uses high-frequency letters T, I, N and places A in position 3.

From the latest feedback:

CRACK → C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(-) K(x)

- C is correct in position 1 (first letter).
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- The second C is in the word but not in position 4 (it must therefore be in position 5).
- K is not in the word at all.

So the word must be:
C R A _ C

Known letters already used: C, R, A
Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, T, I, N, K
Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible 5-letter words fitting C R A _ C:

- CRAWC – not a word

The only plausible English word ending in C with this pattern is CRAMP, but that ends in P. Wait, let me double-check the pool of letters again.

Actually, the valid English word that fits the pattern C R A _ C is CRACK, but we've already used that. The only remaining valid word seems to be CRAGC which doesn't exist.

Wait, let me reconsider - the second C being ""-"" means it's in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have C in position 1, this would imply the word has two Cs, which is unlikely unless it's CRACC (not a word). 

I think the correct interpretation is that there is only one C in the word, and the feedback for the second C is indicating that a single C exists but not at position 4. Therefore, the word must be C R A _ _ with no second C.

Re-evaluating:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Positions 4-5: unknown, but cannot contain C (since the second C was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position, implying there's only one C in the word)

So the word is: C R A _ _
And available letters (excluding ruled out ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,crawl,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 highly common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _
A must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
We need to avoid O, S, E entirely.

Good remaining letters (from popular Wordle-starting lists) that haven’t been ruled out: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, B, F, H, K, G, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Try A in a new position.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Candidate words:
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – but A is in position 3, which might be good. All letters are unused except R.
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – A in position 3.
- DRAIN (D, R, A, I, N) – A in position 3.

I'll go with TRAIN as it uses high-frequency letters T, I, N and places A in position 3.

Available remaining letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We still need to place A in position 3 and R in position 2. We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, and one more for position 1.

Looking for common patterns:

- DRANK (but N is ruled out)
- FRACK (F, R, A, C, K)
- GRASP (but S is ruled out)
- CRAMP (C, R, A, M, P)

The only plausible English word ending in C with this pattern is CRAMP, but that ends in P. Wait, let me double-check the pool of letters again.

Actually, the valid English word that fits the pattern C R A _ C is CRACK, but we've already used that. The only remaining valid word seems to be CRAGC which doesn't exist.

Wait, let me reconsider - the second C being ""-"" means it's in the word but not in position 4. Since we already have C in position 1, this would imply the word has two Cs, which is unlikely unless it's CRACC (not a word). 

I think the correct interpretation is that there is only one C in the word, and the feedback for the second C is indicating that a single C exists but not at position 4. Therefore, the word must be C R A _ _ with no second C.

Re-evaluating:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: A (✓)
- Positions 4-5: unknown, but cannot contain C (since the second C was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position, implying there's only one C in the word)

So the word is: C R A _ _
And available letters (excluding ruled out ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with CRA:
- CRABS
- CRAGS
- CRAMP
- CRAMS
- CRANE (E ruled out)
- CRANK (K ruled out)
- CRAP
- CRAPS
- CRASH (S ruled out)
- CRATE (T, E ruled out)
- CRAVE

From these, CRAMP, CRABS, CRAVE, CRAZY look promising.

CRAMP uses M and P (both unused).
CRABS uses B and S (S ruled out).
CRAVE uses V and E (E ruled out).
CRAZY uses Z and Y (Z not common).

Therefore, the best next guess is CRAMP.Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with C R A
- The second C in ""CRACK"" being marked ""-"" indicates there's only one C (already in position 1)
- K is not in the word

- CRAB (4 letters) + need 5th letter
- Actually, the only 5-letter CRA words are:
  - CRAZY (Z, Y – Z not yet ruled out, but let’s check)
  - CRAGS (G, S – S ruled out)
  - CRAMS (M, S – both ruled out)
  - CRAMP (M, P – both ruled out)
  - CRASH (S, H – S ruled out)
  - CRATE (T, E – both ruled out)
  - CRAVE (V, E – E ruled out)
  - CRAWD (D – needs 5 letters)
  - CRAWL (W, L – both allowed)
  - CRAYS (S ruled out)
  - CRAZY (Z, Y – Z not yet checked, but Y is allowed)

Between CRAZY and CRAWL:
- CRAZY: uses Z (not yet ruled out) and Y (allowed)
- CRAWL: uses W (allowed) and L (allowed)

Both are valid, but let’s choose the more common one: CRAWL.",Guess 5: CRAWL -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
