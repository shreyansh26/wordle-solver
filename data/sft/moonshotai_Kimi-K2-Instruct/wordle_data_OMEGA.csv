So the partial word must look like:

The two missing letters are consonants not yet used (cannot be R, S, C, N). Popular consonants we haven’t tried include T, L, D, G, B, H, K, M, P, etc.

To maximize information, pick a word that places different consonants in positions 4 and 5. A common pattern would be O-A-E-T-?. We can try “OAKEY” or “OATEN”, but “O” followed by “A” and “E” severely limits valid English words. The most common words fitting OAE?? are “OAKED” or “OAKEN”. Between these, “OAKED” uses D (new consonant) and K (new consonant), while “OAKEN” uses N (already ruled out). So “OAKED” is a valid English word that uses untested consonants.

Let’s check: O-A-E-K-D; letters used are O, A, E, K, D.  
- O and E are confirmed in place.  
- A is tested in the only remaining slot (position 2).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters:
- Fixed in place: O (1st), E (3rd)
- Known to be in the word, but NOT in tested positions: A
- Known NOT in the word: R, S, C, N, K, D
- Untested consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Word skeleton so far:  
O _ E _ _

A has already been ruled out of positions 1, 3, 4, 5, so the only spot left for A is position 2.  
Therefore the word must be:  
O A E _ _

Now we need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) that:
- Are consonants.
- Have not been ruled out.
- Combine with O, A, E to form a real English word.

Scanning common consonants that fit after “OAE”:
- OAKEY – but K is excluded.
- OAFTA – not a word.
- OAELT – not a word.
- OAEMB – not a word.
- OAE?? – the only real word that pops up is “OAFET” (not a recognized word) and “OATEN” (but N is excluded).

Wait—let’s list real English words fitting “OA E _ _”:
- OAKEY – invalid (K excluded)
- OAFET – not a word
- OAMET – not a word
- OAPED – D excluded
- OA HEM – not a word
- OAEGT – not a word
- OAELT – not a word
- OAEGP – not a word
- OAEGM – not a word
- OAEGB – not a word
- OAEGF – not a word
- OAEGH – not a word
- OAEGJ – not a word
- OAEG L – only candidate that looks like a word is “OATEN” but N is excluded.

Let me step back: the only plausible remaining English word that fits the constraints (O A E _ _, no R,S,C,N,K,D) is “OATEN” – but N is excluded. There is not a single standard English word left that satisfies all constraints. This implies our deduction that A must be in position 2 is correct, yet no common word exists, so we must test the combination anyway.

Among the consonants still allowed, the most common ones are T and L. Let’s test T in position 4 and L in position 5:

“OAETL” – not a word  
“OAE T L” – swap them:  
“OAELT” – not a word  
“OAETB” – not a word  
“OAETG” – not a word  
“OAETM” – “OATEM” – not a word  
“OAETH” – “OATH E” – not a word  
“OAET P” – “OATEP” – not a word  

There is only one remaining consonant that could logically follow: T and H.

The word “OATHE” is a recognized 5-letter English word (a verb form of “oathe” meaning to swear, though rare). It uses:
- O (pos 1), A (pos 2), E (pos 3) – all correctly placed per deductions.
- T (pos 4) and H (pos 5) – both consonants not yet tried and not ruled out.

So the best next guess is “OATHE”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,OMEGA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all  
- O(-): O is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- S(x): S is NOT in the word at all  
- E(-): E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S  
- Letters definitely IN the word (somewhere): A, O, E  
- Un-tested letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

I want a new word that
1. keeps A, O, E but moves them to different positions, and  
2. introduces new consonants that haven’t been tested.  

Possible template: ? ? ? ? ?  
- A can’t be 1st.  
- O can’t be 3rd.  
- E can’t be 5th.  

A solid choice is “OCEAN”:
- O moves to position 1 (allowed)  
- C (new consonant) in position 2  
- E in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (allowed)  
- N (new consonant) in position 5  

This tests three of the known letters plus two new consonants (C, N) we haven’t seen, maximizing information gain.

- O(✓) : O is in the word and is now locked in position 1.

- E(✓) : E is in the word and is locked in position 3.  
- A(-) : A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- N(x) : N is NOT in the word.

Letters we now know:
- Definitely in the word and placed: O (1st), E (3rd).  
- Definitely in the word but wrong place: A (already excluded pos 1,3,4,5; only position 2 remains).  
- Definitely NOT in the word: R, S (from first guess) and C, N (from second guess).

So the partial word must look like:
O _ E _ _

And the only remaining spot for A is position 2:
O A E _ _

The two missing letters are consonants not yet used (cannot be R, S, C, N). Popular consonants we haven’t tried include T, L, D, G, B, H, K, M, P, etc.

To maximize information, pick a word that places different consonants in positions 4 and 5. A common pattern would be O-A-E-T-?. We can try “OAKEY” or “OATEN”, but “O” followed by “A” and “E” severely limits valid English words. The most common words fitting OAE?? are “OAKED” or “OAKEN”. Between these, “OAKED” uses D (new consonant) and K (new consonant), while “OAKEN” uses N (already ruled out). So “OAKED” is a valid English word that uses untested consonants.

Let’s check: O-A-E-K-D; letters used are O, A, E, K, D.  
- O and E are confirmed in place.  
- A is tested in the only remaining slot (position 2).  
- K and D are new consonants not yet tried, giving information.

Thus, the next logical guess is “OAKED”.

So “OAKED” is a valid English word that uses untested consonants.\n\nLet’s check: O-A-E-K-D; letters used are O, A, E, K, D.  \n- O and E are confirmed in place.  \n- A is tested in the only remaining slot (position 2).  \n- K and D are new consonants not yet tried, giving information.\n\nThus, the next logical guess is “OAKED”.\n\n<guess>OAKED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) C(x) E(✓) A(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: OAKED -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) K(x) E(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s consolidate everything we now know.\n\nLetters:\n- Fixed in place: O (1st), E (3rd)\n- Known to be in the word, but NOT in tested positions: A\n- Known NOT in the word: R, S, C, N, K, D\n- Untested consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWord skeleton so far:  \nO _ E _ _\n\nA has already been ruled out of positions 1, 3, 4, 5, so the only spot left for A is position 2.  \nTherefore the word must be:  \nO A E _ _\n\nNow we need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) that:\n- Are consonants.\n- Have not been ruled out.\n- Combine with O, A, E to form a real English word.\n\nScanning common consonants that fit after “OAE”:\n- OAKEY – but K is excluded.\n- OAFTA – not a word.\n- OAELT – not a word.\n- OAEMB – not a word.\n- OAE?? – the only real word that pops up is “OAFET” (not a recognized word) and “OATEN” (but N is excluded).\n\nWait—let’s list real English words fitting “OA E _ _”:\n- OAKEY – invalid (K excluded)\n- OAFET – not a word\n- OAMET – not a word\n- OAPED – D excluded\n- OA HEM – not a word\n- OAEGT – not a word\n- OAELT – not a word\n- OAEGP – not a word\n- OAEGM – not a word\n- OAEGB – not a word\n- OAEGF – not a word\n- OAEGH – not a word\n- OAEGJ – not a word\n- OAEG L – only candidate that looks like a word is “OATEN” but N is excluded.\n\nLet me step back: the only plausible remaining English word that fits the constraints (O A E _ _, no R,S,C,N,K,D) is “OATEN” – but N is excluded. There is not a single standard English word left that satisfies all constraints. This implies our deduction that A must be in position 2 is correct, yet no common word exists, so we must test the combination anyway.\n\nAmong the consonants still allowed, the most common ones are T and L. Let’s test T in position 4 and L in position 5:\n\n“OAETL” – not a word  \n“OAE T L” – swap them:  \n“OAELT” – not a word  \n“OAETB” – not a word  \n“OAETG” – not a word  \n“OAETM” – “OATEM” – not a word  \n“OAETH” – “OATH E” – not a word  \n“OAET P” – “OATEP” – not a word  \n\nThere is only one remaining consonant that could logically follow: T and H.\n\nThe word “OATHE” is a recognized 5-letter English word (a verb form of “oathe” meaning to swear, though rare). It uses:\n- O (pos 1), A (pos 2), E (pos 3) – all correctly placed per deductions.\n- T (pos 4) and H (pos 5) – both consonants not yet tried and not ruled out.\n\nSo the best next guess is “OATHE”.\n\n<guess>OATHE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) C(x) E(✓) A(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: OAKED -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) K(x) E(-) D(x)\nGuess 4: OATHE -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(-) T(x) H(x) E(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s update everything we now know:

Positions 1 and 3 are fixed:
1 = O, 3 = E

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
R, S, C, N, K, D, T, H

Letters that are still allowed (and not yet placed):
B, F, G, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the repeated letters that have not been ruled out.

We also have a letter A which MUST appear somewhere (because it got “-” feedback every time), but it is NOT allowed in positions
1, 3, 4, 5 so far.  
Looking at every previous guess:

- AROSE: A at 1 (-)  
- OCEAN: A at 4 (-)  
- OAKED: A at 2 (-)  
- OATHE: A at 2 (-)  

Position 2 has now been tried twice with A and both times got “-”, so A is now **also excluded from position 2**.

That leaves **all positions 1,2,3,4,5 ruled out for A** – an impossibility.  
The only way this can happen is if A appears **twice** in the secret word (one instance already accounted for by the “-” marks, but the second instance still needs to be placed).

Therefore:
- The secret word contains an A, and it must appear in one of the positions that have not yet produced a “-” for A – but every position has now produced a “-”.  
- The only resolution is that the word contains **two A’s**.

Positions left to fill: 2, 4, 5  
We need two new consonants and one of the positions must be A.

Current skeleton: O _ E _ _

We must place A in either 2, 4, or 5, but positions 2 and 4 have already given “-” for A; that means **A must appear twice**: one of the earlier placements was counted against a different A, and a second A must sit in one of the remaining spots that have **never been occupied by A** in any guess.

Looking back:

- Position 2 has never shown “A” except in OAKED/OATHE → both got “-”  
- Position 4 has only been tried once (OCEAN) → got “-”  
- Position 5 has never had A in any guess.

Hence the second A must be in position 5.

So the word is now: O _ E A _

We need to fill position 2 with a consonant not yet ruled out (cannot be R,S,C,N,K,D,T,H).  
Popular choices: F, G, L, M, P, B, etc.

Looking for real 5-letter English words fitting O*E*A*:  
- OLEFA – not a word  
- OPELA – not a word  
- OMEGA – this is valid, and uses M and G, neither of which has been ruled out.

Check letters: O(1) M(2) E(3) G(4) A(5)  
- O and E already confirmed in place  
- A will now be tried at position 5 for the first time  
- M and G are new consonants that haven’t been used.  
The word OMEGA is legitimate and satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is OMEGA.
