For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common, uses frequently occurring letters in English, and can help me gather maximum information about the possible letters in the secret word. 

Some good starting words in Wordle-like games are ones that contain common vowels and consonants. Classic choices include words like:
- STARE
- ARISE
- RAISE
- SLATE
- CRANE

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, I, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- Good mix of letters that can reveal a lot about possible positions

This should give me solid feedback to work with for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
S(x): S is NOT in the word at all.
E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain R, S, or E
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are still unknown
- Position 1 cannot be A
- Position 3 cannot be I

Letters to avoid: R, S, E
Letters we know are in the word: A, I
We need a new guess that places A and I elsewhere and uses fresh letters.

Good next steps:
- Try to place A in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1)
- Try to place I in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3)
- Use common consonants not yet eliminated: T, N, L, C, etc.

A strong candidate is ""PAINT"":
- P (new letter)
- A (must be in word, now in position 2)
- I (must be in word, now in position 3) - but wait, position 3 can't be I, so this is bad.

Alternative: ""TRAIN"":
- T (new)
- R (but we know R is out)

Alternative: ""PLAID"":
- P,L,D (new)
- A (in position 2)
- I (in position 4) - this works since I can't be in position 3

But ""PLAID"" might be too specific. Let's try ""PAINT"" but adjust - ""PAINT"" has I in position 3 which we can't have.

Better: ""CLAIM"":
- C,L,M (new letters)
- A in position 2
- I in position 4
This fits all constraints.

Another good option: ""TAINT"":
- T,N (new)
- A in 2
- I in 4
But double T might be less optimal.

Best seems ""CLAIM"".
