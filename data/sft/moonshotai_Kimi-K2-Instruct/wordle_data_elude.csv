For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are good because they cover frequently used letters and vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct last position (marked ✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain A, R, O, S.

My next guess should avoid those four letters and place E in the last spot. Good consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, etc. A decent vowel still available is I. A word like ""UNTIE"" would be good, but it has an R which is excluded. ""LINED"" is another option, but it has an N and a D, which are fine. However, ""LINED"" has an N in position 3 and D in position 4, which might not be optimal. 

A better choice might be ""INLET"". It uses I and E (E is already confirmed), and N, L, T are all new letters not yet ruled out. This gives us a good spread of new consonants to test.

But actually, ""INLET"" has L in position 4 and T in position 5, but we know position 5 is E, so that won't work. Let me rethink.

A better word is ""UNTIE"" but U is allowed, N, T, I are allowed, and E is fixed at position 5. However, ""UNTIE"" has 5 letters: U N T I E. This seems valid.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - none of these are the excluded letters (A, R, O, S), and E is in position 5. This seems like a good next guess.

Possible candidates:

- LUMME (not valid)
- MUDGE (has D and G, but D is allowed)

""GUMBY"" ends with Y, not E.  
""MULIE"" (invalid).  

""FUDGE"" would be valid, but it doesn't contain U.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- E is in the word and in the correct last position (marked ✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain A, R, O, S.

My next guess should avoid those four letters and place E in the last spot. Good consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, etc. A decent vowel still available is I.

But actually, ""INLET"" has L in position 4 and T in position 5, but we know position 5 is E, so that won't work. Let me rethink.

A better word is ""UNTIE"" but U is allowed, N, T, I are allowed, and E is fixed at position 5. However, ""UNTIE"" has 5 letters: U N T I E. This seems valid.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - none of these are the excluded letters (A, R, O, S), and E is in position 5. This seems like a good next guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

   - E is again confirmed at the 5th position.
   - U is in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - N, T, I are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains U, but U is NOT in position 1.
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Remaining possible vowels for other positions: E is already used, so only Y (sometimes a vowel) could be considered, but likely other vowels are already ruled out (A, O, I).  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains U (not in first position) and avoids A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Possible candidates:
- BUMPE (not a valid word)
- DUMBE (not valid)
- FUGUE (valid, and has U in position 2 and ends with E)
- LUMME (not valid)
- MUDGE (has D and G, but D is allowed)
- PUDGE (similar)

Among these, ""FUGUE"" seems valid and uses F, U, G, U, E - but we don't have any constraints on F or G yet, and U appears twice (allowed if the word permits). However, double U might not be optimal for narrowing down. 

Another option: ""DUMBE"" is invalid.  
""GUMBY"" ends with Y, not E.  
""MULIE"" (invalid).  

""FUDGE"" would be valid, but it doesn't contain U.  
""PLUME"" - P, L, U, M, E - this fits:
   - Ends with E.
   - Contains U in position 3 (allowed since U is not in position 1).
   - Avoids all excluded letters: A, R, O, S, N, T, I.
   - Uses new letters P, L, M which haven't been tested.

From the feedback so far:

  – Position 5 = E

- Allowed for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, V, W, Y (must form a valid 5-letter word).

1. BLUDE – invalid (no such word)
2. BLUME – invalid (M is excluded)

8. GLU_E – _G_ in pos 1, _E_ in pos 4 → GLUEE invalid.

The only remaining real word that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters is:

- GLUEE (invalid — double E, not a word)

Ah, I missed the obvious one:

- BLUE?  Needs 5 letters: BLU-E → BLUED (past tense of blue), but that’s 5 letters: B L U E D.

BLUED is a valid English word (past tense of the verb “to blue”), and:
- B is allowed
- L, U, E are locked
- D is still allowed

So BLUED fits perfectly.

Another candidate: CLUED (C allowed, L, U, E locked, D allowed).  
Both BLUED and CLUED are valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CLUED.

The only remaining real word that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters is:

- GLUEE (invalid — double E, not a word)

Ah, I missed the obvious one:

- BLUE?  Needs 5 letters: BLU-E → BLUED (past tense of blue), but that’s 5 letters: B L U E D.

BLUED is a valid English word (past tense of the verb “to blue”), and:
- B is allowed
- L, U, E are locked
- D is still allowed

So BLUED fits perfectly.

Another candidate: CLUED (C allowed, L, U, E locked, D allowed).  
Both BLUED and CLUED are valid.  
Between them CLUED is more common.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CLUED.",Guess 5: CLUED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) U(✓) E(-) D(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,elude,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are good because they cover frequently used letters and vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct last position (marked ✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain A, R, O, S.

My next guess should avoid those four letters and place E in the last spot. Good consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, etc. A decent vowel still available is I. A word like ""UNTIE"" would be good, but it has an R which is excluded. ""LINED"" is another option, but it has an N and a D, which are fine. However, ""LINED"" has an N in position 3 and D in position 4, which might not be optimal. 

A better choice might be ""INLET"". It uses I and E (E is already confirmed), and N, L, T are all new letters not yet ruled out. This gives us a good spread of new consonants to test.

But actually, ""INLET"" has L in position 4 and T in position 5, but we know position 5 is E, so that won't work. Let me rethink.

A better word is ""UNTIE"" but U is allowed, N, T, I are allowed, and E is fixed at position 5. However, ""UNTIE"" has 5 letters: U N T I E. This seems valid.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - none of these are the excluded letters (A, R, O, S), and E is in position 5. This seems like a good next guess.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Only E is in the word and is placed correctly at the 5th position.  
   - A, R, O, S are all absent.

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
   - E is again confirmed at the 5th position.
   - U is in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - N, T, I are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains U, but U is NOT in position 1.
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Remaining possible vowels for other positions: E is already used, so only Y (sometimes a vowel) could be considered, but likely other vowels are already ruled out (A, O, I).  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains U (not in first position) and avoids A, R, O, S, N, T, I.

Possible candidates:
- BUMPE (not a valid word)
- DUMBE (not valid)
- FUGUE (valid, and has U in position 2 and ends with E)
- LUMME (not valid)
- MUDGE (has D and G, but D is allowed)
- PUDGE (similar)

Among these, ""FUGUE"" seems valid and uses F, U, G, U, E - but we don't have any constraints on F or G yet, and U appears twice (allowed if the word permits). However, double U might not be optimal for narrowing down. 

Another option: ""DUMBE"" is invalid.  
""GUMBY"" ends with Y, not E.  
""MULIE"" (invalid).  

""FUDGE"" would be valid, but it doesn't contain U.  
""PLUME"" - P, L, U, M, E - this fits:
   - Ends with E.
   - Contains U in position 3 (allowed since U is not in position 1).
   - Avoids all excluded letters: A, R, O, S, N, T, I.
   - Uses new letters P, L, M which haven't been tested.

So ""PLUME"" is a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we now know:

1. The word has the pattern: _ L U _ E  
   (positions 2, 3, 5 are locked in as L, U, E respectively)

2. Letters we have ruled out so far:
   A, R, O, S, N, T, I, P, M  
   (from feedback on guesses 1-3)

3. Letters still allowed:
   B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Has L in position 2  
- Has U in position 3  
- Has E in position 5  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set in positions 1 and 4  

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 4:
- B _ U _ E: BLUBE (invalid)  
- C _ U _ E: CLUKE (invalid), CLUTE (invalid)  
- F _ U _ E: FLUKE (valid), FLUME (but M is out)  
- G _ U _ E: GLUTE (valid)  
- V _ U _ E: VLU_E (invalid)  

The two valid candidate words that fit are:
- FLUKE  
- GLUTE  

Between these, ""FLUKE"" is a more common word, so I'll try that first.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Pattern locked in: _ L U _ E  
  – Position 2 = L  
  – Position 3 = U  
  – Position 5 = E  

- Letters already excluded: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, P, M, F, K  

- Allowed for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, V, W, Y (must form a valid 5-letter word).

Look for common English words of the form ? L U ? E:

1. BLUDE – invalid (no such word)
2. BLUME – invalid (M is excluded)
3. CLUTE – invalid (no such word)
4. GLUME – invalid (M is excluded)
5. GLUTE – valid word (G, L, U, T, E) but T is excluded.
6. SLU_E – S is excluded.
7. CLU_E – _C_ in pos 1, _E_ in pos 4 → CLUEE invalid.
8. GLU_E – _G_ in pos 1, _E_ in pos 4 → GLUEE invalid.

The only remaining real word that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters is:
