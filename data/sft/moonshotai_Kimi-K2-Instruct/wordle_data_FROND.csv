- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear in many English words. This should give us good feedback on several letters right away.

I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear in many English words. This should give us good feedback on several letters right away.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: in the word, correct position (✓) → word is of the form R _ _ _ _\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- N: in the word, correct position (✓) → word is of the form R _ _ _ N\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- First letter = R\n- Fifth letter = N\n- Letters we can eliminate: C, A, E\n- We still have to determine positions 2, 3, 4\n\nGood remaining consonants to test: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.\nGood remaining vowels to test: I, O, U (since A and E are out)\n\nI want a word with the pattern R _ _ _ N that uses new letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

From the latest feedback (FRONT → F(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) T(x)) we now know:

1. F is the first letter and is correct.
2. R is the second letter and is correct.
3. O is the third letter and is correct.
4. N is the fourth letter and is correct.
5. T is not in the word.

So the secret word so far is: F R O N _

We only need to determine the last (fifth) letter.  
Letters already used and ruled out: C, A, E, I, S, T  
Letters already used and confirmed: F, R, O, N  

Remaining possible letters for the last position: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common ending consonants after “FRON” could be:
- FROND (D)
- FRONK (K)
- FRONG (G)
- FRONZ (Z – less likely)

The most common among these is “FROND”.

Let’s try FROND.
