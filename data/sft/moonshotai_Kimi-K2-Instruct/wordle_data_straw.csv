For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and might help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This gives us a lot of information about the secret word's composition right away.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which has common consonants and vowels. However, ""AROSE"" covers more vowels initially, so I'll go with that first.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) – the letter A is in the word, but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) – the letter R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the target word:
- Contains A, R, S (all in the wrong places so far).
- Does not contain O or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, S but places them in different spots and avoids O and E.

A common consonant set that fits is S, T, R, A plus one more consonant that isn’t O or E. The word “STRAP” fits the bill: it has S, T, R, A, P and avoids O/E.

Let me check the positions:
- A is now in 4th position (was 1st, so that’s new).
- R is now in 3rd position (was 2nd, so new).
- S is now in 1st position (was 4th, so new).

This should give fresh positional information.

2. Letters present and their known positions:
   - S is in position 1.
   - T is in position 2.
   - R is in position 3.
   - A is in position 4.
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from arose): O, E, P.

Therefore the word looks like: S T R A _

The only letter left to determine is the final one. It must be a letter not yet ruled out (i.e., not O, E, P). Common remaining consonants include D, K, M, N, etc.

A very common English word that fits “STRA_” is “STRAW”, but W hasn’t been tested yet and isn’t forbidden. Another candidate is “STRAK” but that’s not a common word. “STRAM” is also uncommon. The simplest, most common choice is “STRAW”.

Let’s check:
- Letters used so far allowed: S, T, R, A, W (none of O, E, P).
- Pattern: S T R A W matches all known positional constraints.

The word is 5 letters long.\n2. Letters present and their known positions:\n   - S is in position 1.\n   - T is in position 2.\n   - R is in position 3.\n   - A is in position 4.\n3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from arose): O, E, P.\n\nTherefore the word looks like: S T R A _\n\nThe only letter left to determine is the final one. It must be a letter not yet ruled out (i.e., not O, E, P). Common remaining consonants include D, K, M, N, etc.\n\nA very common English word that fits “STRA_” is “STRAW”, but W hasn’t been tested yet and isn’t forbidden. Another candidate is “STRAK” but that’s not a common word. “STRAM” is also uncommon. The simplest, most common choice is “STRAW”.\n\nLet’s check:\n- Letters used so far allowed: S, T, R, A, W (none of O, E, P).\n- Pattern: S T R A W matches all known positional constraints.\n\nSo “STRAW” should be the unique solution if it is indeed a valid 5-letter English word, which it is.The pattern is now clear: S T R A _.

From the feedback history we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O and E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. strap → S(✓) T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(x)
   - S is correctly in position 1.
   - T is correctly in position 2.
   - R is correctly in position 3.
   - A is correctly in position 4.
   - P is not in the word.

So the word must be of the form: S T R A _ and the last letter must be a consonant that:
- Has not been eliminated (not O, E, P).
- Has not already appeared in positions 1-4 (S, T, R, A are already used).

Possible remaining consonants for the last position: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with ""STRA"", the most common are:
- STRAW
- STRAY
- STRAP (but P is excluded)
- STRAG (not common)
- STRAK (not common)
- STRAN (not common)

""STRAW"" uses W, which hasn't been tested or eliminated, and is a common word.

Therefore, ""STRAW"" is the most logical next guess.
