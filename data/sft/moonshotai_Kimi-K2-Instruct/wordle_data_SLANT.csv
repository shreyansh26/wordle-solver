For the first guess, it's best to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. The English alphabet has some letters that appear more frequently in 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these common letters without repeating any, to test as many different letters as possible.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 very common consonants: R, S

This gives us a good spread of common letters to see which ones might be in the target word.

The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 4, so it must be in positions 1-3 or 5).
- E is NOT in the word.

So far:
- Letters **known to be in the word**: A, S
- Letters **known NOT to be in the word**: R, O, E
- Remaining unused common letters to test: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

To maximize information gain, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letters A and S in new positions.
2. Introduces several new common letters.
3. Avoids R, O, E.

Possible candidates: 
- STAND (S, A, T, N, D) – but S is in the same position as before (position 1), which is against the feedback (S was in position 4 and is in the word but wrong position). So S cannot be in position 1 here.
- SALTY – S in position 1 (same issue), A in position 2 (new), L/T/Y new.
- SLANT – S in position 1 (same issue), L/A/N/T new.
- LASSO – contains O (invalid), S repeats (not ideal).
- PASTE – contains E (invalid).
- SAINT – S in position 1 (invalid), A in position 2, I/N/T new.

A better choice is ""SLANT"":
- S is moved to position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, and in AROSE it was position 4, so position 1 could be valid unless it's the same as original. Wait – original S was position 4, so position 1 is new for S).
- A is moved to position 3 (new position from original 1).
- L, N, T are new letters.

But let me double-check ""SLANT"":
- S is in position 1 (original was 4, so this is a new position – allowed).
- A is in position 3 (original was 1 – allowed).
- L, N, T are new.

This seems valid. Alternatively, ""STAIN"":
- S in position 1 (new from original 4), A in position 2 (new from 1), T/I/N new.

Between SLANT and STAIN, SLANT seems slightly better for testing L and N. However, STAIN also covers I. Both are good, but I'll go with SLANT.

Another check: ""SUAVE"" – but E is invalid.
""SAUCY"" – C/Y new, but C is less common.

I think SLANT is the best next guess here.
