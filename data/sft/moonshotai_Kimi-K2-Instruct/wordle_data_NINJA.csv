For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the target word.
2. Has no repeating letters to get the most information possible.
3. Includes vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one vowel.

Common first guesses in Wordle-like games often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

What we know so far:
- No letter in AROSE is in the correct spot (no ✓ marks).
- However, the “-” under the first letter means that A is present in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, O, S, E are all absent from the word entirely (x).

So the word contains an A somewhere other than position 1, and it does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the first position).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.

Good letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y …
Vowels to try: I, U.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “UNTIL” (it has A not in position 1, uses T, N, I, L which we haven’t tested yet, and avoids R, O, S, E). However, A is not in “UNTIL”, so we must include A while obeying the rest.

Another option: “FAINT” – has A in position 2, and uses F, N, T, I (all allowed). Let’s go with that.

Summary of what we now know:

- Letters confirmed not in the word: R, O, S, E, F, T.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (it was wrong in both places).
  – I cannot be in position 3 (it was wrong there).
  – N cannot be in position 4 (it was wrong there).

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A, I, N (each at least once).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E, F, T.
3. Places each of these letters in a still-allowed spot.

Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y plus the required A, I, N.

Let’s look for a word that puts:
- A in position 3 or 4 or 5.
- I in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

Candidate pattern: _ I _ A _ (N could go in positions 1, 3, or 5).
Try the word “CINNA” – but N is doubled; we don’t know if double letters are allowed and it wastes a slot.  
A better candidate: “VINCA” – but C is fine and N is in 3rd.  
Still better: we want to use common consonants.  Try “MIA N_” shape.

“BLAIN” looks good:
- Contains B, L, A, I, N – no forbidden letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- All other letters (B, L) are still untested.

So BLAIN satisfies every constraint.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,NINJA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the target word.
2. Has no repeating letters to get the most information possible.
3. Includes vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one vowel.

Common first guesses in Wordle-like games often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we know so far:
- No letter in AROSE is in the correct spot (no ✓ marks).
- However, the “-” under the first letter means that A is present in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, O, S, E are all absent from the word entirely (x).

So the word contains an A somewhere other than position 1, and it does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the first position).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.

Good letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y …
Vowels to try: I, U.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “UNTIL” (it has A not in position 1, uses T, N, I, L which we haven’t tested yet, and avoids R, O, S, E). However, A is not in “UNTIL”, so we must include A while obeying the rest.

Another option: “FAINT” – has A in position 2, and uses F, N, T, I (all allowed). Let’s go with that.

Guess 2: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:
- Letters known to be somewhere in the word: A, I, N (each got “-” in Guess 1 or Guess 2).
- Letters confirmed not in the word: R, O, S, E, F, T.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (it was wrong in both places).
  – I cannot be in position 3 (it was wrong there).
  – N cannot be in position 4 (it was wrong there).

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A, I, N (each at least once).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E, F, T.
3. Places each of these letters in a still-allowed spot.

Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y plus the required A, I, N.

Let’s look for a word that puts:
- A in position 3 or 4 or 5.
- I in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

Candidate pattern: _ I _ A _ (N could go in positions 1, 3, or 5).
Try the word “CINNA” – but N is doubled; we don’t know if double letters are allowed and it wastes a slot.  
A better candidate: “VINCA” – but C is fine and N is in 3rd.  
Still better: we want to use common consonants.  Try “MIA N_” shape.

“BLAIN” looks good:
- Contains B, L, A, I, N – no forbidden letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- All other letters (B, L) are still untested.

So BLAIN satisfies every constraint.

What we now know:

1. Positions confirmed (✓):
   - N is in position 1
   - I is in position 2
   So the word looks like: N I _ _ _

2. Letters we still know are in the word somewhere (from “-” clues):
   - A (cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 – because it was wrong in 1,2,3 from AROSE/BLAIN/NICAD, and wrong in 4 from NICAD)
     Therefore A must be in position 5.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, E, F, T, B, L, C, D

4. Still-available letters for positions 3 & 4 (cannot be any of the above):
   G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

5. So the target pattern is:
   N I _ _ A
   with the two blanks filled from {G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}, no repeats.

6. Common English 5-letter words matching this pattern:
   - N I G H A  →  NIGHA (archaic or place name, not common)
   - N I G M A  →  NIGMA (rare)
   - N I K H A  →  not a known word
   - N I P P A  →  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
   - N I P P A has P repeated – but we can only use each letter once.
   - N I P H A  →  NIPHA? not valid.
   - N I M B A  →  NIMBA? not standard.
   - N I K A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I K U A  →  not a word.
   - N I M A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P U A  →  not a word.
   - N I G M A  →  already checked, rare.
   - N I K M A  →  not a word.
   - N I M U A  →  not a word.

Actually, let's re-check common words systematically:

Known 5-letter words starting NI and ending A:
- NINJA  – has N twice (N already used in position 1) and J not yet considered, J is allowed, but N repeats. Also J not yet excluded, but double N is invalid because we only have one N left.
- NIAGA  – not a word (looks like “naga” but NIAGA isn’t valid).
- NIKKA  – repeats K and has K twice.
- NIPPA  – valid British slang, but repeats P.
- NIGHT  – ends with T (T is excluded).
- NIMBA  – doesn’t end in A.
- NINNY  – ends in Y but repeats N.
- NISGA  – place name, not common.
- NITTA  – ends in T (T excluded).

Wait – let me check dictionary list carefully for NI _ _ A:

N I G H A  –  NIGHA (not common)
N I M B A  –  NIMBA (valid name for a tree)
N I P P A  –  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
N I K A A  –  invalid
N I P H A  –  invalid
N I G M A  –  NIGMA (rare)
N I M P A  –  NIMPA? not valid.

It seems NIMBA is the most plausible valid 5-letter word with NI _ _ A, using letters N, I, M, B, A – but B is already excluded (from BLAIN feedback).

Next possible: N I P U A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid
N I K M A  – invalid
N I K H A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid

Actually, let's check remaining single-letter choices for positions 3 and 4:

Positions 3 and 4 must be different letters from {G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}, and they must combine into a valid word ending in A.

Consider:
- N I G H A → NIGHA (not common)
- N I G P A → NIGPA (invalid)
- N I G M A → NIGMA (rare)
- N I H G A → NIHGA (invalid)
- N I K H A → NIKHA (invalid)
- N I K M A → NIKMA (invalid)
- N I M G A → NIMGA (invalid)
- N I P G A → NIPGA (invalid)
- N I P H A → NIPHA (invalid)
- N I P K A → NIPKA (valid – a type of fish, also spelled NYMPHA but that has invalid letters)

Actually, NIPKA is valid (variant spelling of NIPA, but NIPA is a palm). But P and K are allowed.

But let's check: N I P K A – uses N, I, P, K, A – all letters are allowed (P, K not excluded), no duplicates.

So NIPKA is a valid guess.

Another check: N I M P A – NIMPA (invalid)
N I M K A – NIMKA (invalid)
N I G K A – NIGKA (invalid)
N I H K A – NIHKA (invalid)

NIPKA appears to be the only valid 5-letter word in NI _ _ A pattern using remaining allowed letters.

Therefore:
<guess>NIPKA</guess>
</think>

<guess>NIPKA</guess>",NIPKA,"What we now know:

1. Positions confirmed (✓):
   - N is in position 1
   - I is in position 2
   So the word looks like: N I _ _ _

2. Letters we still know are in the word somewhere (from “-” clues):
   - A (cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4 – because it was wrong in 1,2,3 from AROSE/BLAIN/NICAD, and wrong in 4 from NICAD)
     Therefore A must be in position 5.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, E, F, T, B, L, C, D

4. Still-available letters for positions 3 & 4 (cannot be any of the above):
   G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

5. So the target pattern is:
   N I _ _ A
   with the two blanks filled from {G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}, no repeats.

6. Common English 5-letter words matching this pattern:
   - N I G H A  →  NIGHA (archaic or place name, not common)
   - N I G M A  →  NIGMA (rare)
   - N I K H A  →  not a known word
   - N I P P A  →  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
   - N I P P A has P repeated – but we can only use each letter once.
   - N I P H A  →  NIPHA? not valid.
   - N I M B A  →  NIMBA? not standard.
   - N I K A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I K U A  →  not a word.
   - N I M A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P U A  →  not a word.
   - N I G M A  →  already checked, rare.
   - N I K M A  →  not a word.
   - N I M U A  →  not a word.

Actually, let's re-check common words systematically:

Known 5-letter words starting NI and ending A:
- NINJA  – has N twice (N already used in position 1) and J not yet considered, J is allowed, but N repeats. Also J not yet excluded, but double N is invalid because we only have one N left.
- NIAGA  – not a word (looks like “naga” but NIAGA isn’t valid).
- NIKKA  – repeats K and has K twice.
- NIPPA  – valid British slang, but repeats P.
- NIGHT  – ends with T (T is excluded).
- NIMBA  – doesn’t end in A.
- NINNY  – ends in Y but repeats N.
- NISGA  – place name, not common.
- NITTA  – ends in T (T excluded).

Wait – let me check dictionary list carefully for NI _ _ A:

N I G H A  –  NIGHA (not common)
N I M B A  –  NIMBA (valid name for a tree)
N I P P A  –  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
N I K A A  –  invalid
N I P H A  –  invalid
N I G M A  –  NIGMA (rare)
N I M P A  –  NIMPA? not valid.

It seems NIMBA is the most plausible valid 5-letter word with NI _ _ A, using letters N, I, M, B, A – but B is already excluded (from BLAIN feedback).

Next possible: N I P U A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid
N I K M A  – invalid
N I K H A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid

Actually, let's check remaining single-letter choices for positions 3 and 4:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,NINJA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the target word.
2. Has no repeating letters to get the most information possible.
3. Includes vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one vowel.

Common first guesses in Wordle-like games often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we know so far:
- No letter in AROSE is in the correct spot (no ✓ marks).
- However, the “-” under the first letter means that A is present in the secret word but not in the first position.
- R, O, S, E are all absent from the word entirely (x).

So the word contains an A somewhere other than position 1, and it does **not** contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the first position).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.

Good letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y …
Vowels to try: I, U.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses common letters is “UNTIL” (it has A not in position 1, uses T, N, I, L which we haven’t tested yet, and avoids R, O, S, E). However, A is not in “UNTIL”, so we must include A while obeying the rest.

Another option: “FAINT” – has A in position 2, and uses F, N, T, I (all allowed). Let’s go with that.

<guess>FAINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:
- Letters known to be somewhere in the word: A, I, N (each got “-” in Guess 1 or Guess 2).
- Letters confirmed not in the word: R, O, S, E, F, T.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (it was wrong in both places).
  – I cannot be in position 3 (it was wrong there).
  – N cannot be in position 4 (it was wrong there).

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A, I, N (each at least once).
2. Excludes R, O, S, E, F, T.
3. Places each of these letters in a still-allowed spot.

Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y plus the required A, I, N.

Let’s look for a word that puts:
- A in position 3 or 4 or 5.
- I in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4).

Candidate pattern: _ I _ A _ (N could go in positions 1, 3, or 5).
Try the word “CINNA” – but N is doubled; we don’t know if double letters are allowed and it wastes a slot.  
A better candidate: “VINCA” – but C is fine and N is in 3rd.  
Still better: we want to use common consonants.  Try “MIA N_” shape.

“BLAIN” looks good:
- Contains B, L, A, I, N – no forbidden letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- All other letters (B, L) are still untested.

So BLAIN satisfies every constraint.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts (from all 3 guesses)

Letters we now know are **somewhere** in the word (each marked “-” at least once):
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3)
- I (cannot be in position 3 or 5 – it was wrong there in FAINT and BLAIN)
- N (cannot be in positions 4 or 5 – it was wrong there in FAINT and BLAIN)

Letters we know are **NOT** in the word:
R O S E F T B L

Still-available letters (common ones):
C D G H K M P U V W Y, plus the required A I N

Vowel positions still allowed for A:
positions 4 or 5 (it was wrong in 1, 2, 3)

Vowel positions still allowed for I:
positions 1, 2, or 4  (it was wrong in 3, 5)

Consonant positions still allowed for N:
positions 1, 2, or 3  (it was wrong in 4, 5)

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, I, N (once each) plus two still-allowed consonants, without repeating any letter and without using any forbidden letter.

Candidate template ideas:

1. N I _ A _   – N in 1st, I in 2nd, A in 4th  
   Needs consonants for 3rd and 5th that are allowed and different.  
   Good consonants left: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Trying NI_ A_ gives “NIDAL” (but D, L – L is already excluded).  
   “NICKA” – K is allowed, but ends with A which would put A in 5th (allowed) but we already have A.  
   “NIPPA” – repeats P.  
   “NICAD” – uses C, D both allowed; check word list – NICAD is a valid English word (nickel-cadmium battery).  
   Let’s verify: NICAD  
   Letters: N I C A D  
   - N: allowed in position 1  
   - I: allowed in position 2  
   - C: never tried, allowed  
   - A: allowed in position 4  
   - D: never tried, allowed  
   No forbidden letters, no repeats. This looks perfect.

So the next guess is NICAD.

     Therefore A must be in position 5.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, E, F, T, B, L, C, D

4. Still-available letters for positions 3 & 4 (cannot be any of the above):
   G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

5. So the target pattern is:
   N I _ _ A
   with the two blanks filled from {G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}, no repeats.

6. Common English 5-letter words matching this pattern:
   - N I G H A  →  NIGHA (archaic or place name, not common)
   - N I G M A  →  NIGMA (rare)
   - N I K H A  →  not a known word
   - N I P P A  →  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
   - N I P P A has P repeated – but we can only use each letter once.
   - N I P H A  →  NIPHA? not valid.
   - N I M B A  →  NIMBA? not standard.
   - N I K A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I K U A  →  not a word.
   - N I M A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P A A  →  repeats A.
   - N I P U A  →  not a word.
   - N I G M A  →  already checked, rare.
   - N I K M A  →  not a word.
   - N I M U A  →  not a word.

Actually, let's re-check common words systematically:

Known 5-letter words starting NI and ending A:
- NINJA  – has N twice (N already used in position 1) and J not yet considered, J is allowed, but N repeats. Also J not yet excluded, but double N is invalid because we only have one N left.
- NIAGA  – not a word (looks like “naga” but NIAGA isn’t valid).
- NIKKA  – repeats K and has K twice.
- NIPPA  – valid British slang, but repeats P.
- NIGHT  – ends with T (T is excluded).
- NIMBA  – doesn’t end in A.
- NINNY  – ends in Y but repeats N.
- NISGA  – place name, not common.
- NITTA  – ends in T (T excluded).

Wait – let me check dictionary list carefully for NI _ _ A:

N I G H A  –  NIGHA (not common)
N I M B A  –  NIMBA (valid name for a tree)
N I P P A  –  NIPPA (British slang, valid)
N I K A A  –  invalid
N I P H A  –  invalid
N I G M A  –  NIGMA (rare)
N I M P A  –  NIMPA? not valid.

It seems NIMBA is the most plausible valid 5-letter word with NI _ _ A, using letters N, I, M, B, A – but B is already excluded (from BLAIN feedback).

Next possible: N I P U A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid
N I K M A  – invalid
N I K H A  – invalid
N I P H A  – invalid

Actually, let's check remaining single-letter choices for positions 3 and 4:

Positions 3 and 4 must be different letters from {G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y}, and they must combine into a valid word ending in A.

- N I M G A → NIMGA (invalid)
- N I P G A → NIPGA (invalid)
- N I P H A → NIPHA (invalid)
- N I P K A → NIPKA (valid – a type of fish, also spelled NYMPHA but that has invalid letters)

Actually, NIPKA is valid (variant spelling of NIPA, but NIPA is a palm). But P and K are allowed.

But let's check: N I P K A – uses N, I, P, K, A – all letters are allowed (P, K not excluded), no duplicates.

So NIPKA is a valid guess.

Another check: N I M P A – NIMPA (invalid)
N I M K A – NIMKA (invalid)
N I G K A – NIGKA (invalid)

- Still-allowed letters for positions 3 and 4 (from the remaining alphabet, excluding the above):
  G H M U V W Y

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting N I _ _ A with those two blanks filled by any two distinct letters from {G H M U V W Y}.

Candidate word list:
- NIGHA – uses G H  (NIGHA is archaic but recognized)
- NIGMA – uses G M  (rare)
- NIMHA – uses M H  (invalid)
- NINJA – repeats N (already used) and uses J (banned)
- NIUVA – invalid
- NIVGA – invalid
- NIWHA – invalid
- NIMYA – invalid
- NIGVA – invalid

Only common-enough matching word: NIGHA (letters N I G H A), with G and H both still allowed, no repeats.

So the next guess is NIGHA.
