For my first guess, I'll choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting guess because it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me maximum coverage of frequently used letters in English words while avoiding any duplicate letters. This approach will likely give me at least one or two correct letters in the first guess, which I can then use to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(-) – R appears in the word, but NOT in position 2.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- The last letter is E.
- R must appear somewhere in the word (but not 2nd position).
- A, O, S are completely absent.

The remaining available letters (common ones not yet ruled out) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and avoiding A, O, S.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E at position 5.
2. Place R in a new position (not 2nd) to test its location.
3. Use other common consonants/vowels we haven’t eliminated.

The word ""TRIBE"" is a good candidate:
- Ends in E (position 5).  
- Contains R in position 2 (new position for R).  
- Uses T, I, B which are all still possible.

1) From the first two guesses we already know:
   – The word ends in ‘E’ (position 5).
   – ‘R’ is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2 or 3 (because in both TRIBE and AROSE it got a “-” in those spots).
   – Letters A, O, S, T, B are definitely absent.
   – Letters I and R are in the word but in wrong positions so far.

2) Possible positions left for R: 1, 4 (can’t be 2,3,5).

3) We still need three more letters.  Good remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Vowels still allowed: E (already fixed in 5), I (confirmed present), U (never tested), and sometimes Y.

4) Let’s try to place R in position 4, and test a new consonant in position 1.  
   A simple candidate that fits all constraints is:
        C R I E ?
   But the last letter must be E, so the word would be “CRIER” – but it repeats R; we don’t know for sure that R is allowed twice, and it’s safer to avoid repeats at this stage.

   Another candidate that avoids repeats and tests new letters:
        F R I E ?  → “FRIER” – again repeats R.

   How about “DIRGE”?  
   - Ends with E.  
   - Contains R (in position 3) – but we already know from TRIBE that R can’t be in position 3.  So DIRGE would automatically get R(-) again and add nothing.

   Let’s instead place R in position 1 and fill the middle with new consonants/vowels we haven’t used:
        R _ _ _ E
   The third position could be I, which we know is in the word.  
   Let’s try “RINSE” – but S is already ruled out.

   Next: “RIDGE”  
   - Ends E.  
   - R in position 1 (new).  
   - Uses D, G which are fresh letters.  
   - Contains I, which we know is in the word (wrong position so far).  

   This looks clean and will tell us:
   – Whether R is in position 1.  
   – A new placement for I.  
   – Status of D and G.

So I’ll guess RIDGE.
