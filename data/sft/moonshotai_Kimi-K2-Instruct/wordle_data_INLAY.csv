For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word. The best starting words typically include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common starter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: one of the most common consonants
- E: the most common letter in English

However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" instead because:
1. It has S, L, T (all very common consonants)
2. It has A and E (the two most common vowels)
3. It covers 5 distinct letters which maximizes information gain
4. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in the first position.

- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3

We still need a word using L, A, I and avoiding S, T, E, P, D.

- R (new)
- A – position 3 is still invalid, but here A is in 3 – no good.

Next: ""FLAIR"" – same issue, A is in 3.

Next: ""LAIRY"" – has Y, but A is in 1, which is new for A. Let's see:
- L is in position 1 – new for L (was 2 before), A in 2 (was 3 before), I in 3 (was 4 before). This moves all required letters to new positions.

But Y might be okay – not forbidden yet.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" – has C, A, I, R, N. But lacks L.

- A in 3 – invalid (was bad in guess 1 and 2)

""LARIS"" – has S, which is forbidden.

""LIANA"" – has A in 3 – invalid.

""ALIBI"" – has B, I – but A is in 1, I in 3, L in 2. A is position 1 (new), L is 2 (invalid), so no.

""CLAIM"" – has C, L, A, I, M – positions:
- C (new)
- L in 2 – invalid (was 2 in guess 1 and 2)

""GLIAL"" – has G, L, I, A, L – but L repeated, and A is 4 (new), I is 3 (invalid, was 4 before).

""AVAIL"" – A is 1 (new), V new, A is 2 (new), I is 3 (invalid), L is 5 (new).

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains L and A, but not S, T, or E.
2. L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

I now need a five-letter word with L and A, and without S, T, or E.  
I’ll look for a word that re-uses L and A while introducing some new common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has L (in a new position) and A (in a new position).
- It introduces P, I, and D, none of which were tested yet.
- All letters are distinct from the banned ones (S, T, E).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the cumulative feedback:
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D
- Present letters: L, A, I (all with wrong positions so far)

Positions we now know:
- L is not in position 2 (from SLATE) and not in position 2 again (from PLAID), so L ≠ 2
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3
- I is not in position 4 (from PLAID), so I ≠ 4

We still need a word using L, A, I and avoiding S, T, E, P, D.

I need to place A, I, L in new positions, while introducing new allowed consonants. Good remaining common consonants are R, N, C, G, B, etc.

Looking for a word with A, I, L and new letters:

- Could be R, N, etc.

A candidate word: RAIL? No, that's 4 letters.

Wait – we need 5 letters.

Let's try 5-letter words:
- ""FRAIL"" – uses F, R, A, I, L. All letters allowed. Positions: A not in 3, I not in 4, L not in 2.

Let's check positions:
- F (new)
- R (new)
- A – position 3 is still invalid, but here A is in 3 – no good.

Next: ""FLAIR"" – same issue, A is in 3.

Next: ""LAIRY"" – has Y, but A is in 1, which is new for A. Let's see:
- L is in position 1 – new for L (was 2 before), A in 2 (was 3 before), I in 3 (was 4 before). This moves all required letters to new positions.

But Y might be okay – not forbidden yet.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" – has C, A, I, R, N. But lacks L.

Need L.

Next: ""CRAIL"" – C, R, A, I, L – this has all required letters and new positions:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A in 3 – invalid (was bad in guess 1 and 2)

No.

""LARIS"" – has S, which is forbidden.

""LIANA"" – has A in 3 – invalid.

""ALIBI"" – has B, I – but A is in 1, I in 3, L in 2. A is position 1 (new), L is 2 (invalid), so no.

""VALID"" – has D, which is forbidden.

""CLAIM"" – has C, L, A, I, M – positions:
- C (new)
- L in 2 – invalid (was 2 in guess 1 and 2)
  
Hmm.

""GLIAL"" – has G, L, I, A, L – but L repeated, and A is 4 (new), I is 3 (invalid, was 4 before).

""AVAIL"" – A is 1 (new), V new, A is 2 (new), I is 3 (invalid), L is 5 (new).

But I in 3 is invalid.

""RAIUL"" – not a word.

""AILSA"" – not valid, has S.

""FLAIL"" – F, L, A, I, L – but L in 2 is invalid.

""ALIEN"" – has E, forbidden.

""ALOUD"" – has D, forbidden.

""PLAIN"" – has P, forbidden.

""GLAZE"" – has Z, E, forbidden.

""CLIMB"" – lacks A.

""BRAIL"" – B, R, A, I, L – positions:
- B (new)
- R (new)
- A in 3 – invalid (was 3 before)
  
No.

""GRAIL"" – G, R, A, I, L – A is 3 – invalid.

""VIRAL"" – has V, I, R, A, L – positions:
- V new
- I in 2 (new)
- R new
- A in 4 (new)
- L in 5 (new)

This uses all required letters in new positions and introduces new allowed letters (V, R).

""VIRAL"" seems good.

Check letters: V, I, R, A, L – none are forbidden, and positions:
- L is 5 (was 2 before) – ok
- A is 4 (was 3 before) – ok
- I is 2 (was 4 before) – ok

This should be valid.

From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, V, R  
Known letters in word: A, L, I  
Known positions:  
- A is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.  
- I is in word but NOT in position 2 or 4.  

So the word pattern now looks like:  
_ _ _ A _ with A fixed in slot 4.  
We still need to place L and I in the remaining slots, avoiding their previously ruled-out positions.  

Available slots left: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- L is allowed in 1, 3, 5 (but 5 already ruled out ⇒ 1 or 3).  
- I is allowed in 1, 3, 5.  

We also need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet (common remaining: N, C, G, B, M, etc.).

A word satisfying these constraints is “CILIA”:
- C (new, allowed), I (allowed positions 1 or 3), L (allowed positions 1 or 3), I again, A fixed at 4.  
But that repeats I, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.

Let’s pick a word with distinct letters: “FINAL” – but F and N are new and allowed, and positions:
F(1), I(2) – but I can’t be in 2 (was ruled out in VIRAL). So invalid.

Next: “MIAUL” – uses M, I, A, U, L.  
Positions: M(1), I(2) – again I in 2 is invalid.

Next: “BINAL” – positions B(1), I(2) same issue.

“GIMLA” – but A is fixed at 4, not 5.

“CLAIM” – but R is forbidden, C, L, A, I, M.  
A is at 4, so positions: C(1), L(2) – but L can’t be at 2. Invalid.

“FACIL” – but A is at 4, so positions would be F(1), A(2) which is invalid.

“MURAL” – R is forbidden.

“BINAL” again has I at 2 invalid.

“CIGAL” – C(1), I(2) invalid.

“FILAM” – A at 4, so F(1), I(2) invalid.

“MIAOW” – but O, W untested.

Wait, let’s focus on valid placement:

We need to fill 1,2,3,5 with L, I, and two other allowed consonants.

A valid word: “FLAIN” – but N is allowed, positions: F(1), L(2) – L can’t be 2.

“GLAIN” – G(1), L(2) – same issue.

“BLAIN” – same.

“ILIAC” – A is at 4, so this doesn’t fit.

“MILIA” – A is at 4, so positions: M(1), I(2) invalid.

“LIMAN” – L(1), I(2) invalid.

Hmm, let’s try L in 3:  
Then positions: _ _ L A _

“GILAS” – S banned.

“MINAL” – M(1), I(2) invalid.

“NIALM” – not valid.

Then word starts with L: L _ _ A _  
Possible: L I _ A _ – I can be 2 or 3 or 5.  
But I can’t be in 2 or 4 (already known), and 4 is A.  
So I could be 2 or 3 or 5.

But L at 1, A at 4: L _ _ A _  
Try I at 2: L I _ A _  
Need two more letters. Common: N, C, G, etc.  
Word: “LIMAS” – S banned.

“LIGAN” – N allowed, positions: L(1), I(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) – all letters allowed and positions valid.  
Check constraints:
- A is at 4 (✓).  
- L is at 1 – allowed (was previously 2,5).

The best starting words typically include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common starter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: one of the most common consonants
- E: the most common letter in English

However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" instead because:
1. It has S, L, T (all very common consonants)
2. It has A and E (the two most common vowels)
3. It covers 5 distinct letters which maximizes information gain
4. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in the first position.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains L and A, but not S, T, or E.
2. L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3.

I now need a five-letter word with L and A, and without S, T, or E.  
I’ll look for a word that re-uses L and A while introducing some new common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has L (in a new position) and A (in a new position).
- It introduces P, I, and D, none of which were tested yet.
- All letters are distinct from the banned ones (S, T, E).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the cumulative feedback:

- Present letters: L, A, I (all with wrong positions so far)

Positions we now know:
- L is not in position 2 (from SLATE) and not in position 2 again (from PLAID), so L ≠ 2
- A is not in position 3 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 again (from PLAID), so A ≠ 3
- I is not in position 4 (from PLAID), so I ≠ 4

We still need a word using L, A, I and avoiding S, T, E, P, D.

I need to place A, I, L in new positions, while introducing new allowed consonants. Good remaining common consonants are R, N, C, G, B, etc.

Looking for a word with A, I, L and new letters:

- Could be R, N, etc.

A candidate word: RAIL? No, that's 4 letters.

Wait – we need 5 letters.

Let's try 5-letter words:
- ""FRAIL"" – uses F, R, A, I, L. All letters allowed. Positions: A not in 3, I not in 4, L not in 2.

Let's check positions:
- F (new)
- R (new)
- A – position 3 is still invalid, but here A is in 3 – no good.

Next: ""FLAIR"" – same issue, A is in 3.

Next: ""LAIRY"" – has Y, but A is in 1, which is new for A. Let's see:
- L is in position 1 – new for L (was 2 before), A in 2 (was 3 before), I in 3 (was 4 before). This moves all required letters to new positions.

But Y might be okay – not forbidden yet.

Another candidate: ""CAIRN"" – has C, A, I, R, N. But lacks L.

Need L.

Next: ""CRAIL"" – C, R, A, I, L – this has all required letters and new positions:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A in 3 – invalid (was bad in guess 1 and 2)

No.

""LARIS"" – has S, which is forbidden.

""LIANA"" – has A in 3 – invalid.

""ALIBI"" – has B, I – but A is in 1, I in 3, L in 2. A is position 1 (new), L is 2 (invalid), so no.

""VALID"" – has D, which is forbidden.

""CLAIM"" – has C, L, A, I, M – positions:
- C (new)
- L in 2 – invalid (was 2 in guess 1 and 2)
  
Hmm.

""GLIAL"" – has G, L, I, A, L – but L repeated, and A is 4 (new), I is 3 (invalid, was 4 before).

""AVAIL"" – A is 1 (new), V new, A is 2 (new), I is 3 (invalid), L is 5 (new).

But I in 3 is invalid.

""RAIUL"" – not a word.

""AILSA"" – not valid, has S.

""FLAIL"" – F, L, A, I, L – but L in 2 is invalid.

""ALIEN"" – has E, forbidden.

""ALOUD"" – has D, forbidden.

""PLAIN"" – has P, forbidden.

""GLAZE"" – has Z, E, forbidden.

""CLIMB"" – lacks A.

""BRAIL"" – B, R, A, I, L – positions:
- B (new)
- R (new)
- A in 3 – invalid (was 3 before)
  
No.

""GRAIL"" – G, R, A, I, L – A is 3 – invalid.

""VIRAL"" – has V, I, R, A, L – positions:
- V new
- I in 2 (new)
- R new
- A in 4 (new)
- L in 5 (new)

This uses all required letters in new positions and introduces new allowed letters (V, R).

""VIRAL"" seems good.

Check letters: V, I, R, A, L – none are forbidden, and positions:
- L is 5 (was 2 before) – ok
- A is 4 (was 3 before) – ok
- I is 2 (was 4 before) – ok

This should be valid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, V, R  
Known letters in word: A, L, I  
Known positions:  
- A is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.  
- I is in word but NOT in position 2 or 4.  

So the word pattern now looks like:  
_ _ _ A _ with A fixed in slot 4.  
We still need to place L and I in the remaining slots, avoiding their previously ruled-out positions.  

Available slots left: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- L is allowed in 1, 3, 5 (but 5 already ruled out ⇒ 1 or 3).  
- I is allowed in 1, 3, 5.  

We also need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet (common remaining: N, C, G, B, M, etc.).

A word satisfying these constraints is “CILIA”:
- C (new, allowed), I (allowed positions 1 or 3), L (allowed positions 1 or 3), I again, A fixed at 4.  
But that repeats I, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.

Let’s pick a word with distinct letters: “FINAL” – but F and N are new and allowed, and positions:
F(1), I(2) – but I can’t be in 2 (was ruled out in VIRAL). So invalid.

Next: “MIAUL” – uses M, I, A, U, L.  
Positions: M(1), I(2) – again I in 2 is invalid.

Next: “BINAL” – positions B(1), I(2) same issue.

“GIMLA” – but A is fixed at 4, not 5.

“CLAIM” – but R is forbidden, C, L, A, I, M.  
A is at 4, so positions: C(1), L(2) – but L can’t be at 2. Invalid.

“FACIL” – but A is at 4, so positions would be F(1), A(2) which is invalid.

“MURAL” – R is forbidden.

“BINAL” again has I at 2 invalid.

“CIGAL” – C(1), I(2) invalid.

“FILAM” – A at 4, so F(1), I(2) invalid.

“MIAOW” – but O, W untested.

Wait, let’s focus on valid placement:  
Fixed: _ _ _ A _  
We need to fill 1,2,3,5 with L, I, and two other allowed consonants.

A valid word: “FLAIN” – but N is allowed, positions: F(1), L(2) – L can’t be 2.

“GLAIN” – G(1), L(2) – same issue.

“BLAIN” – same.

“ILIAC” – A is at 4, so this doesn’t fit.

“MILIA” – A is at 4, so positions: M(1), I(2) invalid.

“LIMAN” – L(1), I(2) invalid.

Hmm, let’s try L in 3:  
Then positions: _ _ L A _  
We need I in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is available).  
A word: “CIGLA” – but A is at 4, not 5.

“GILAN” – positions: G(1), I(2) invalid.

“GILAS” – S banned.

“MINAL” – M(1), I(2) invalid.

“NIALM” – not valid.

“BINAL” again invalid.

“FINAL” – F(1), I(2) invalid.

Let’s try L in 1:  
Then word starts with L: L _ _ A _  
Possible: L I _ A _ – I can be 2 or 3 or 5.  
But I can’t be in 2 or 4 (already known), and 4 is A.  
So I could be 2 or 3 or 5.

But L at 1, A at 4: L _ _ A _  
Try I at 2: L I _ A _  
Need two more letters. Common: N, C, G, etc.  
Word: “LIMAS” – S banned.

“LIGAN” – N allowed, positions: L(1), I(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) – all letters allowed and positions valid.  
Check constraints:
- A is at 4 (✓).  
- L is at 1 – allowed (was previously 2,5).  
- I is at 2 – allowed (was previously 4, now 2).  
- G, N are new and allowed.  

“LIGAN” fits all constraints.

Known:
- A is locked in position 4 (✓).
- The word contains L, I, A, N (all found but in wrong positions so far).
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, D, V, R, G.

Positions ruled out:
- L cannot be in 2, 5 (from PLAID and LIGAN), and not in 1 (from LIGAN). So L must be in position 3.
- I cannot be in 2 (from VIRAL), 4 (A is there), 5 (from LIGAN). So I must be in position 1.
- N cannot be in 5 (from LIGAN). So N must be in position 2 or 3. But 3 is taken by L. Therefore N must be in position 2.

So the word structure is now determined:
Position 1: I
Position 2: N
Position 3: L
Position 4: A
Position 5: (must be a new letter not yet used or forbidden)

Available letters (excluding forbidden ones): B, C, F, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
