For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can provide maximum information. The best starting words typically include:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

After analyzing strategic starting words, some of the most recommended first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with **AROSE** as it's a strong starting word that contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Forms a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(✓): R is in the word AND in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
1. Word has form: _ R _ _ _
2. Contains E (but not at position 5)
3. Does not contain A, O, or S

Next steps:
- We should include E in a new position
- Avoid A, O, S
- Common remaining letters to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good second guess would be:
- GREET: puts E in positions 3 and 4, but has double E which isn't ideal
- CRUEL: includes C, U, E, L - but U isn't confirmed yet
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D - covers common letters and moves E to position 3

I'll go with TREND as it tests several new common consonants while maintaining the confirmed R in position 2 and moving E to position 3.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: T R _ _ D  (positions 1, 2 and 5 are fixed)
2. Letters in the word but misplaced:
   - E is present but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (the only two remaining open spots), which is impossible—so something is wrong with my reasoning.

Wait—let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

- Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
  – R is in position 2 and is correct.
  – E appears in the word but not at position 5.

- Guess 2: trend → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(✓)
  – T is in position 1 and is correct.
  – R is in position 2 and is correct (confirmed again).
  – E appears in the word but not at position 3 (because the feedback was “E(-)”).
  – N is not in the word.
  – D is in position 5 and is correct.

So the pattern is now locked as: T R _ _ D

The remaining letters must be placed in positions 3 and 4.

Constraints:
- The word contains E, but E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (already excluded), so E must be in position 4.

Thus the pattern becomes: T R _ E D

Only position 3 is still unknown.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, N

We need a common consonant for position 3. Remaining common letters include: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s choose a frequent consonant: C gives T R C E D which is not a word.  
F gives T R F E D – not a word.  
H gives T R H E D – not a word.  
I gives T R I E D – TRIED is a valid English word.

So TRIED fits all the constraints:
- T R I E D
- T(✓) R(✓) I(?) E(-) D(✓)
