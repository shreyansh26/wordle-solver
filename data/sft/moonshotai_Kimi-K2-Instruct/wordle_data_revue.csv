Since this is my first guess, I have no information about the secret word. To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that contains common letters and covers different possible letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, N, L).

One of the most recommended starting words in Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Other viable options could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓)

- Contains R (but not in 2nd spot)

- E is still in position 5 (✓), but the earlier E in position 3 is NOT in position 3 (-), so there is at least one E elsewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).
- P is not in the word (x).

- We have no info yet on: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

R cannot be in position 2. E is in position 5. We need to test R in positions 1, 3, or 4. A good next word would be one that tests new letters and places R in a new spot while keeping E at position 5.

Better candidate: ""RIVER"" - but E is already in position 5, so this doesn't work.

From Guess 3 (LIVER):

Summary so far:
- Known letters and positions:

  - 3rd letter: V
- Known letters but unknown positions:
  - R (cannot be in positions 2, 5; and not yet placed in 1,3,4 except 3 is taken by V)

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with V in the 3rd position, containing R not in positions 2 or 5, and possibly another E in positions 1 or 2.

Possible pattern: _ _ V _ E  
R must go in position 1 or 4 (cannot be in 3 or 5).

Let's try:
- R _ V _ E: R is in position 1
Possible letters for 2 and 4: from untested consonants and remaining vowels (only E is possible since A,O,I are out)

Words to try:
- R U V E E (invalid, not a word)
- R A V E E (invalid, A is out)
- R E V E E (valid word)

REVEN: but N not tested yet, pattern R E V E N but this has 5 letters ending in N which contradicts E at 5.

Wait, we need 5-letter word ending in E with V in 3rd and R somewhere.

Actually the word must be _ _ V _ E with R in 1 or 4.

So:
- R _ V _ E: R _ V _ E → R A V E N but A is out, R U V E N but U is valid, but N isn't placed yet.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,revue,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that contains common letters and covers different possible letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, N, L).

One of the most recommended starting words in Wordle strategy is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Other viable options could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word:
- Ends with E
- Contains R (but not in 2nd spot)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

Good next step: pick a word that keeps the confirmed E in the last slot, introduces new letters, and places R somewhere new.  
A strong candidate is “CREPE”:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Moves R to position 2 (allowed, since R wasn’t ruled out for position 2).
- Adds fresh consonants C and P, and a new vowel E in position 3.

So far we know:

- Letters we know are in the word: R (not in 2), E (position 5)
- We have no info yet on: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

R cannot be in position 2. E is in position 5. We need to test R in positions 1, 3, or 4. A good next word would be one that tests new letters and places R in a new spot while keeping E at position 5.

A strong candidate is ""TRIPE"":
- T, I, P are new letters (P is already ruled out by feedback, so this is bad)
Oops, P is ruled out. So ""TRIPE"" is out.

Next candidate: ""TRIBE"" - B is new, but we haven't tested B yet. But we have only tested 2 vowels so far (A, O, E), and I hasn't been tested.

Better candidate: ""RIVER"" - but E is already in position 5, so this doesn't work.

Another option: ""DRIVE"" - but P is already out, and R is in position 2 which is ruled out.

Wait, we need to place R in a new position not tested yet. Positions tested for R:
- Guess 1: position 2 (AROSE)
- Guess 2: position 2 (CREPE)
So R is definitely not in position 2. We need to test R in positions 1, 3, or 4.

""PRIDE"" - P is out.

This gives good coverage to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.\n\nOther viable options could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learn:\n- A is NOT in the word (x)\n- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)\n- O is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Ends with E\n- Contains R (but not in 2nd spot)\n- Does NOT contain A, O, or S\n\nGood next step: pick a word that keeps the confirmed E in the last slot, introduces new letters, and places R somewhere new.  \nA strong candidate is “CREPE”:\n- Keeps E in position 5.\n- Moves R to position 2 (allowed, since R wasn’t ruled out for position 2).\n- Adds fresh consonants C and P, and a new vowel E in position 3.\n\n<guess>CREPE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CREPE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) P(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From Guess 2 (CREPE) we now know:\n- C is not in the word (x).\n- R is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).\n- E is still in position 5 (✓), but the earlier E in position 3 is NOT in position 3 (-), so there is at least one E elsewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).\n- P is not in the word (x).\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, C, P\n- Letters we know are in the word: R (not in 2), E (position 5)\n- We have no info yet on: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nR cannot be in position 2.

Positions tested for R:\n- Guess 1: position 2 (AROSE)\n- Guess 2: position 2 (CREPE)\nSo R is definitely not in position 2.

From Guess 4 (NEVER) we now know:
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- V is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3
- E in position 4 is NOT in the word (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 3 = V
- Position 5 = E
- R must be in position 1 or 4 (it cannot be in positions 2,3,5)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, S, C, P, L, I, N

We need a 5-letter word in the form:
_ E V _ E

And the missing letters (positions 1 and 4) must:
- Include R (in 1 or 4)
- Come from the remaining untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

Possible patterns:
- R E V _ E (R in position 1)
- _ E V R E (R in position 4)

Looking at the first pattern (R E V _ E):
- The 4th letter must be from the remaining untested letters
- Real word candidates: REVUE (U is allowed), REVEE (invalid), etc.

Looking at the second pattern (_ E V R E):
- The 1st letter must be from the remaining untested letters
- Real word candidates: BEVRE (invalid), DEVRE (invalid), etc.

Real word check:
- REVUE is valid and fits R E V U E
- BEVRE doesn't seem valid
- GEVRE doesn't exist
- MEVRE doesn't exist
- TEVRE doesn't exist

The only viable candidate appears to be REVUE, which fits all constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 ✓
- V in position 3 ✓
- U is untested
- E in position 5 ✓
