For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also strong
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - includes the very common I

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback:
- R(x) — R is not in the word at all
- A(-) — A is in the word, but not in position 2
- I(x), S(x), E(x) — none of these letters appear in the word

So far we know:
- The word contains an A (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E

Therefore the remaining letters to consider are consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels O and U (since A is already confirmed and E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place the A somewhere other than position 2 to test new positions
2. Include mostly new, common consonants to gather more information
3. Avoid R, I, S, E entirely

A word like ""CLAMP"" would use C, L, M, P (all new) and place the A in position 2 again (bad).  
A word like ""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T (new) and puts A in position 3, which is an untested position.

Another strong candidate is ""MOUNT"" which uses M, O, U, N, T — all new letters and puts A aside while testing other vowels.

But since we know A is in the word, we should prioritize testing its position. The word ""PLANK"" uses P, L, N, K (new) and places A in position 3. However, K is less common.

Instead, ""PLANT"" seems better because it tests more common letters (P, L, N, T) with A in position 3.

I'll go with ""MOUNT"" first to test O and U since we already know A is present, and it covers a broad set of common letters.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: RAISE

- O, N, T are NOT in the word.  
- M is in the word but NOT at position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT at position 3.

So far we know:
1. MUST include: A and U, and possibly M.  
2. MUST NOT include: R, I, S, E, O, N, T.  
3. Letters M, A, U must be placed in positions they have NOT been tested in yet.  

Possible remaining useful consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

We have 5 slots and need to fit A, U, and possibly M while testing new letters.  

A good next word should:
- Contain A and U (and maybe M) in new positions.  
- Use common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- LUMPY – uses L, U, M, P, Y. But Y is less common.  
- CLAMP – uses C, L, A, M, P, but P is already covered in MOUNT.  
- PLUMB – uses P, L, U, M, B. B is new and common.  

Looking at the letters:  
- M has only been tested at position 1 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 2,3,4,5.  
- A has only been tested at position 2 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,3,4,5.  
- U has only been tested at position 3 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,2,4,5.  

A strong candidate is ""PLUMB"":
- P: new letter, common.  
- L: new letter, common.  
- U: in the word, placed at position 3 in MOUNT (now at position 3 again, but we know it's not there – so this is bad, we should move U).  

Alternative: ""CLAMP"":
- C: new.  
- L: new.  
- A: tested at position 2, now at position 3 (ok).  
- M: tested at position 1, now at position 4 (ok).  
- P: new.  

But this uses P and we already have some info from MOUNT (but P was not in MOUNT, so it's fine).  

Another candidate: ""UMBRA"" – but this uses R, which we know is out.  

""GLYPH"" – uses G, L, Y, P, H, but doesn't include A or U.  

""ABDUCT"" – too long.  

""MAULS"" – uses S, which is out.  

""PLUMB"" has U in position 3, which we know is wrong, so skip.  

""CLAMP"" is better.  

But we should ensure A and U are both in the word. CLAMP only has A.  

We need a word with both A and U, and possibly M.  

Possible words:
- MURAL – uses M, U, R, A, L. R is out.  
- ULAMA – uses U, L, A, M, A. But A is repeated.  
- MAULS – uses S, which is out.  
- AMBLE – uses E, which is out.  
- AMPUL – uses A, M, P, U, L. This seems perfect.  

""AMPUL"":
- A: tested at position 2 (now at 1) – ok.  
- M: tested at position 1 (now at 2) – ok.  
- P: new.  
- U: tested at position 3 (now at 4) – ok.  
- L: new.  

This tests A, M, U in new positions and introduces P and L.

Good starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also strong
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - includes the very common I

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R(x) — R is not in the word at all
- A(-) — A is in the word, but not in position 2
- I(x), S(x), E(x) — none of these letters appear in the word

So far we know:
- The word contains an A (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E

Therefore the remaining letters to consider are consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels O and U (since A is already confirmed and E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place the A somewhere other than position 2 to test new positions
2. Include mostly new, common consonants to gather more information
3. Avoid R, I, S, E entirely

A word like ""CLAMP"" would use C, L, M, P (all new) and place the A in position 2 again (bad).  
A word like ""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T (new) and puts A in position 3, which is an untested position.

Another strong candidate is ""MOUNT"" which uses M, O, U, N, T — all new letters and puts A aside while testing other vowels.

But since we know A is in the word, we should prioritize testing its position. The word ""PLANK"" uses P, L, N, K (new) and places A in position 3. However, K is less common.

Instead, ""PLANT"" seems better because it tests more common letters (P, L, N, T) with A in position 3.

I'll go with ""MOUNT"" first to test O and U since we already know A is present, and it covers a broad set of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word.  
- A is in the word but NOT at position 2.

Guess 2: MOUNT  
M(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)  
- O, N, T are NOT in the word.  
- M is in the word but NOT at position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT at position 3.

So far we know:
1. MUST include: A and U, and possibly M.  
2. MUST NOT include: R, I, S, E, O, N, T.  
3. Letters M, A, U must be placed in positions they have NOT been tested in yet.  

Possible remaining useful consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

We have 5 slots and need to fit A, U, and possibly M while testing new letters.  

A good next word should:
- Contain A and U (and maybe M) in new positions.  
- Use common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- LUMPY – uses L, U, M, P, Y. But Y is less common.  
- CLAMP – uses C, L, A, M, P, but P is already covered in MOUNT.  
- PLUMB – uses P, L, U, M, B. B is new and common.  

Looking at the letters:  
- M has only been tested at position 1 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 2,3,4,5.  
- A has only been tested at position 2 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,3,4,5.  
- U has only been tested at position 3 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,2,4,5.  

A strong candidate is ""PLUMB"":
- P: new letter, common.  
- L: new letter, common.  
- U: in the word, placed at position 3 in MOUNT (now at position 3 again, but we know it's not there – so this is bad, we should move U).  

Alternative: ""CLAMP"":
- C: new.  
- L: new.  
- A: tested at position 2, now at position 3 (ok).  
- M: tested at position 1, now at position 4 (ok).  
- P: new.  

But this uses P and we already have some info from MOUNT (but P was not in MOUNT, so it's fine).  

Another candidate: ""UMBRA"" – but this uses R, which we know is out.  

""GLYPH"" – uses G, L, Y, P, H, but doesn't include A or U.  

""ABDUCT"" – too long.  

""MAULS"" – uses S, which is out.  

""PLUMB"" has U in position 3, which we know is wrong, so skip.  

""CLAMP"" is better.  

But we should ensure A and U are both in the word. CLAMP only has A.  

We need a word with both A and U, and possibly M.  

Possible words:
- MURAL – uses M, U, R, A, L. R is out.  
- ULAMA – uses U, L, A, M, A. But A is repeated.  
- MAULS – uses S, which is out.  
- AMBLE – uses E, which is out.  
- AMPUL – uses A, M, P, U, L. This seems perfect.  

""AMPUL"":
- A: tested at position 2 (now at 1) – ok.  
- M: tested at position 1 (now at 2) – ok.  
- P: new.  
- U: tested at position 3 (now at 4) – ok.  
- L: new.  

This tests A, M, U in new positions and introduces P and L.

Let’s distill what we now know from the three guesses:

Letters that are **not** in the word (x-marked):
R, I, S, E, O, N, T, P

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (- in the feedback means “present but not here”):
A, M, U, L

We also know the disallowed positions for each:
- A ≠ 2 (from RAISE) and A ≠ 1 (from AMPUL)
- M ≠ 1 (from MOUNT) and M ≠ 2 (from AMPUL)
- U ≠ 3 (from MOUNT) and U ≠ 4 (from AMPUL)
- L ≠ 5 (from AMPUL)

So the valid positions are:
A ∈ {3,4,5}
M ∈ {3,4,5}
U ∈ {1,2,5}
L ∈ {1,2,3,4}

Useful remaining consonants (not yet tested) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z

We want a word that uses the confirmed letters A, M, U, L plus one new consonant, while respecting the positional constraints.

Try to place the letters so every restriction is honored. One systematic way:

1. U must be at 1, 2, or 5.
2. A must be at 3, 4, or 5.
3. M must be at 3, 4, or 5 and must not coincide with A in the same spot (since letters are unique in Wordle words).
4. L must be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. We need a fifth letter from the untested consonants.

A compact combination that satisfies these constraints is:
U _ A M L  → but M at 4 and L at 5 would put L at 5 (disallowed).  
U L A M _  → positions: U(1), L(2), A(3), M(4). We need a fifth letter at 5 from untested consonants.  
Choose B (common and new). That gives ULAMB. However, ULAMB isn’t a valid English word.

Try another arrangement:  
_ U A M L → U(2), A(3), M(4), L(5) (but L at 5 is disallowed).  

Try:  
A L U M _ → A at 1 (disallowed).  

Try:  
M U L A _ → M at 1 (disallowed) and A at 4.  

Try:  
U L M A _ → U at 1, L at 2, M at 3, A at 4. We need a fifth letter at 5; choose B → ULMAB (not valid).

Try:  
L U M A _ → L at 1, U at 2, M at 3, A at 4. Again need a fifth letter at 5. Choose C → LUMAC (invalid).

Try:  
_ U M A L → U at 2, M at 3, A at 4, L at 5 (disallowed).

We need a valid English word that uses A, M, U, L plus one new consonant and satisfies the positional constraints.

The combination:
A M U L plus one letter doesn’t give valid words easily. Let’s instead look for 5-letter words containing A, M, U, L, and one new letter.

Real 5-letter words fitting:  
UMLAU – invalid.  
ULAMA – valid word, but uses A twice and we don’t know if A can repeat.  
MALUS – uses S (already out).  
ALUMS – uses S (out).  
MAULS – uses S (out).  
LUMBA – uses B (new), but B is at 5, and we have A(3), U(2), M(4), L(1). This is valid: L(1), U(2), A(3), M(4), B(5).

Check constraints:
- L at 1 – allowed.
- U at 2 – allowed (U ≠ 3,4 so 2 is fine).
- A at 3 – allowed.
- M at 4 – allowed (M ≠ 1,2).
- B is a new consonant.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also strong
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - includes the very common I

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

- R(x) — R is not in the word at all

So far we know:
- The word contains an A (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E

Therefore the remaining letters to consider are consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels O and U (since A is already confirmed and E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place the A somewhere other than position 2 to test new positions
2. Include mostly new, common consonants to gather more information
3. Avoid R, I, S, E entirely

A word like ""CLAMP"" would use C, L, M, P (all new) and place the A in position 2 again (bad).  
A word like ""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T (new) and puts A in position 3, which is an untested position.

Another strong candidate is ""MOUNT"" which uses M, O, U, N, T — all new letters and puts A aside while testing other vowels.

But since we know A is in the word, we should prioritize testing its position. The word ""PLANK"" uses P, L, N, K (new) and places A in position 3. However, K is less common.

Instead, ""PLANT"" seems better because it tests more common letters (P, L, N, T) with A in position 3.

I'll go with ""MOUNT"" first to test O and U since we already know A is present, and it covers a broad set of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word.  
- A is in the word but NOT at position 2.

Guess 2: MOUNT  
M(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)  
- O, N, T are NOT in the word.  
- M is in the word but NOT at position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT at position 3.

So far we know:
1. MUST include: A and U, and possibly M.  
2. MUST NOT include: R, I, S, E, O, N, T.  
3. Letters M, A, U must be placed in positions they have NOT been tested in yet.  

Possible remaining useful consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

We have 5 slots and need to fit A, U, and possibly M while testing new letters.  

A good next word should:
- Contain A and U (and maybe M) in new positions.  
- Use common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- LUMPY – uses L, U, M, P, Y. But Y is less common.  
- CLAMP – uses C, L, A, M, P, but P is already covered in MOUNT.  
- PLUMB – uses P, L, U, M, B. B is new and common.  

Looking at the letters:  
- M has only been tested at position 1 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 2,3,4,5.  
- A has only been tested at position 2 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,3,4,5.  
- U has only been tested at position 3 (and is in the word, but not there), so it could be at 1,2,4,5.  

A strong candidate is ""PLUMB"":
- P: new letter, common.  
- L: new letter, common.  
- U: in the word, placed at position 3 in MOUNT (now at position 3 again, but we know it's not there – so this is bad, we should move U).  

Alternative: ""CLAMP"":
- C: new.  
- L: new.  
- A: tested at position 2, now at position 3 (ok).  
- M: tested at position 1, now at position 4 (ok).  
- P: new.  

But this uses P and we already have some info from MOUNT (but P was not in MOUNT, so it's fine).  

Another candidate: ""UMBRA"" – but this uses R, which we know is out.  

""GLYPH"" – uses G, L, Y, P, H, but doesn't include A or U.  

""ABDUCT"" – too long.  

""MAULS"" – uses S, which is out.  

""PLUMB"" has U in position 3, which we know is wrong, so skip.  

""CLAMP"" is better.  

But we should ensure A and U are both in the word. CLAMP only has A.  

We need a word with both A and U, and possibly M.  

Possible words:
- MURAL – uses M, U, R, A, L. R is out.  
- ULAMA – uses U, L, A, M, A. But A is repeated.  
- MAULS – uses S, which is out.  
- AMBLE – uses E, which is out.  
- AMPUL – uses A, M, P, U, L. This seems perfect.  

""AMPUL"":
- A: tested at position 2 (now at 1) – ok.  
- M: tested at position 1 (now at 2) – ok.  
- P: new.  
- U: tested at position 3 (now at 4) – ok.  
- L: new.  

This tests A, M, U in new positions and introduces P and L.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s distill what we now know from the three guesses:

Letters that are **not** in the word (x-marked):
R, I, S, E, O, N, T, P

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (- in the feedback means “present but not here”):
A, M, U, L

We also know the disallowed positions for each:
- A ≠ 2 (from RAISE) and A ≠ 1 (from AMPUL)
- M ≠ 1 (from MOUNT) and M ≠ 2 (from AMPUL)
- U ≠ 3 (from MOUNT) and U ≠ 4 (from AMPUL)
- L ≠ 5 (from AMPUL)

So the valid positions are:
A ∈ {3,4,5}
M ∈ {3,4,5}
U ∈ {1,2,5}
L ∈ {1,2,3,4}

Useful remaining consonants (not yet tested) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z

We want a word that uses the confirmed letters A, M, U, L plus one new consonant, while respecting the positional constraints.

Try to place the letters so every restriction is honored. One systematic way:

1. U must be at 1, 2, or 5.
2. A must be at 3, 4, or 5.
3. M must be at 3, 4, or 5 and must not coincide with A in the same spot (since letters are unique in Wordle words).
4. L must be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. We need a fifth letter from the untested consonants.

A compact combination that satisfies these constraints is:
U _ A M L  → but M at 4 and L at 5 would put L at 5 (disallowed).  
U L A M _  → positions: U(1), L(2), A(3), M(4). We need a fifth letter at 5 from untested consonants.  
Choose B (common and new). That gives ULAMB. However, ULAMB isn’t a valid English word.

Try another arrangement:  
_ U A M L → U(2), A(3), M(4), L(5) (but L at 5 is disallowed).  

Try:  
A L U M _ → A at 1 (disallowed).  

Try:  
M U L A _ → M at 1 (disallowed) and A at 4.  

Try:  
U L M A _ → U at 1, L at 2, M at 3, A at 4. We need a fifth letter at 5; choose B → ULMAB (not valid).

Try:  
L U M A _ → L at 1, U at 2, M at 3, A at 4. Again need a fifth letter at 5. Choose C → LUMAC (invalid).

Try:  
L A M U _ → L at 1, A at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
U M A L _ → U at 1, M at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
U A M L _ → U at 1, A at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
_ U L A M → U at 2, L at 3, A at 4, M at 5 (M at 5 is allowed). We need a first letter; choose C → CULAM (invalid).

Try:  
_ A M U L → A at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
_ A L U M → A at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
_ M A U L → M at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
_ M U A L → M at 2 (disallowed).

Try:  
_ L A U M → L at 2, A at 3, U at 4 (U at 4 is disallowed).

Try:  
_ L M A U → L at 2, M at 3, A at 4, U at 5. Choose a first letter: choose C → CLMAU (invalid).

Try:  
_ U M A L → U at 2, M at 3, A at 4, L at 5 (disallowed).

We need a valid English word that uses A, M, U, L plus one new consonant and satisfies the positional constraints.

The combination:
A M U L plus one letter doesn’t give valid words easily. Let’s instead look for 5-letter words containing A, M, U, L, and one new letter.

Real 5-letter words fitting:  
UMLAU – invalid.  
ULAMA – valid word, but uses A twice and we don’t know if A can repeat.  
MALUS – uses S (already out).  
ALUMS – uses S (out).  
MAULS – uses S (out).  
LUMBA – uses B (new), but B is at 5, and we have A(3), U(2), M(4), L(1). This is valid: L(1), U(2), A(3), M(4), B(5).

Check constraints:
- L at 1 – allowed.
- U at 2 – allowed (U ≠ 3,4 so 2 is fine).
- A at 3 – allowed.
- M at 4 – allowed (M ≠ 1,2).
- B is a new consonant.

Therefore, the word LUMBA satisfies all constraints.

From all four guesses we now have exact positional information:

Known letters and disallowed positions:
- U is in the word and is in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → therefore A must be in position 5.
- M is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → therefore M must be in position 5.
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → therefore L must be in position 4.

So far we have:
_ U _ L A   (with M also needed, but position 5 is already A)

Wait — that’s impossible: both M and A need position 5.  
That contradiction means one of our deductions must be wrong.  
Recheck:

- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (RAISE and AMPUL).  
- A cannot be in position 3 (AMPUL).  
- A cannot be in position 4 (LUMBA feedback for A is “-” at position 5, so A is not in 5, which contradicts nothing).  
- Therefore A must be in position 3 (only remaining).  
Likewise:

- M cannot be 1,2,3 (MOUNT, AMPUL).  
- M cannot be 4 (LUMBA feedback for M is “-” at 3, not 4).  
- Therefore M must be 5.

Now reconcile:

- U is fixed at 2.  
- A must be 3.  
- M must be 5.  
- L must be somewhere not yet excluded.  
- One other letter needed.

Current skeleton:
_ U A _ M

and L must fit somewhere. The only slot left is 1 or 4.

From LUMBA feedback: L is in the word but not at 1 (L at 1 got “-”).  
Therefore L must be at 4.

So we have:
_ U A L M

We need a single letter at position 1 that hasn’t been tried yet and forms a valid word.  
Untested consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z.

Try G → GUALM (invalid).  
Try C → CUALM (invalid).  
Try D → DUALM (invalid).  
Try J → JUALM (invalid).  
Try K → KUALM (invalid).  
Try V → VUALM (invalid).  
Try H → HUALM (invalid).  
Try W → WUALM (invalid).  
Try Y → YUALM (invalid).  
Try F → FUALM (invalid).  
Try Z → ZUALM (invalid).

Wait, we missed B, but B was in LUMBA and got “x”, so B is out.  
The only remaining single letter that forms a valid English word fitting _ U A L M is…

QU is a digraph. Try Q:  
Q U A L M – the word is “QUALM”, which is valid.

Check:
- Q new.  
- U confirmed at 2.

- M cannot be 1,2,3 (MOUNT, AMPUL).  
- M cannot be 4 (LUMBA feedback for M is “-” at 3, not 4).  
- Therefore M must be 5.

Now reconcile:

- U is fixed at 2.  
- A must be 3.  
- M must be 5.  
- L must be somewhere not yet excluded.  
- One other letter needed.

Current skeleton:
_ U A _ M

and L must fit somewhere. The only slot left is 1 or 4.

From LUMBA feedback: L is in the word but not at 1 (L at 1 got “-”).  
Therefore L must be at 4.

So we have:
_ U A L M

We need a single letter at position 1 that hasn’t been tried yet and forms a valid word.  
Untested consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z.

Try G → GUALM (invalid).  
Try C → CUALM (invalid).  
Try D → DUALM (invalid).  
Try J → JUALM (invalid).  
Try K → KUALM (invalid).  
Try V → VUALM (invalid).  
Try H → HUALM (invalid).  
Try W → WUALM (invalid).  
Try Y → YUALM (invalid).  
Try F → FUALM (invalid).  
Try Z → ZUALM (invalid).

Wait, we missed B, but B was in LUMBA and got “x”, so B is out.  
The only remaining single letter that forms a valid English word fitting _ U A L M is…

QU is a digraph. Try Q:  
Q U A L M – the word is “QUALM”, which is valid.

Check:
- Q new.  
- U confirmed at 2.  
- A at 3 allowed.  
- L at 4 allowed.  
- M at 5 allowed.  
All constraints satisfied.",Guess 5: QUALM -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) L(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
