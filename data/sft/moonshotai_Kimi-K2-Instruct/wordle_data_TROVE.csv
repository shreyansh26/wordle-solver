For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good coverage to deduce the secret word. A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in the English language like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'S', 'I'. 

A good first guess is often ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should provide good feedback on 5 distinct common letters and their positions.

However, another excellent first choice is ""AROSE"" which uses:
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the top 5 most common letters that appear in 5-letter words according to frequency analysis.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in the English language like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'S', 'I'. 

A good first guess is often ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should provide good feedback on 5 distinct common letters and their positions.

However, another excellent first choice is ""AROSE"" which uses:
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the top 5 most common letters that appear in 5-letter words according to frequency analysis.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓, 2nd letter)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓, 3rd letter)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓, 5th letter)

So the secret word looks like: _ R O _ E
I need to find letters for positions 1 and 4 that are not A, S, and haven’t been tested yet.

Good candidates for the 1st letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good candidates for the 4th letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""GROVE"":
- G is a common starting letter
- R, O, E are confirmed correct in their positions
- V is a common letter not yet tested
- This tests G and V in positions 1 and 4 respectively
