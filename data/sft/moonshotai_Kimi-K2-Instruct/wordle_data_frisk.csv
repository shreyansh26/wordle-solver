- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E) that appear in many words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- The letters are all distinct, which helps eliminate more possibilities
- It follows a common letter pattern (consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant)

This should give good coverage to narrow down the possible words quickly.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.  
- R(✓) – R is in the word AND at the 2nd position (index 1).  
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.  
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND at the 4th position (index 3).  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.  

So we know:
- Positions: ? R ? S ? (with indices 0 1 2 3 4 filled as _ R _ s _)
- Letters not in the word: A, O, E
- We still need to find letters for positions 0, 2, and 4.

Good letters to test next are consonants and remaining vowels (I, U are the only vowels left).  
Let’s pick a word that keeps R at 2nd place and S at 4th place, uses new letters only, and tests common consonants/vowels.  
A good candidate is “BRISK”:
- B, I, K are new letters.  
- Keeps R at position 2 and S at position 4.
