For the first guess, I want a word that contains a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word should include frequently used letters to help narrow down possibilities efficiently. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)
This combination should give good coverage across the alphabet and help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- R is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N is NOT in the word.

- Letters not in the word: R, N

I need a new 5-letter word that contains C, A, and E, avoids R and N, and places C, A, E in different positions from before (C was 1st, A was 3rd, E was 5th). A good candidate is ""PEACE"":
- P (not used before)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 2 instead of 5)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 instead of original 3 - wait, same position, that's not allowed)
Let me rethink - A can't be in position 3 again.

Better choice: ""PLACE""
- P (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- A (known in word, now in position 3 - same as original, this is bad)
No, A was originally position 3, can't be there again.

Next option: ""CACHE""
- C (must be in positions 2-5)

Constraints:
- A cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- Must use A and E, and C is already used (position 3), so the other two letters are new.

Possible positions for A and E:

- A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 2, and 3 is C).

We need two more letters that are not R, N, F, T, C, A, E.

Let's think of common letters remaining: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y.

One good candidate is ""PEACH"", but P is not yet ruled out, and H is okay. But E is already used in position 4 here, which is not allowed.

Next, ""BEACH"": E is in position 2, A in position 4, C in 3. This fits:
- B and H are new.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).

But let's check if this makes sense with previous feedback:
- From FACET: position 3 is C (✓), A is not in position 2 (in BEACH, A is in 4, so okay), E is not in 4 or 5 (in BEACH, E is in 2, okay).

Current confirmed information:

1. Position 3 is definitely C.  
   _ _ C _ _

2. E is in the word and must be in position 2 or 1 (it can’t be 4 or 5, and in BEACH it was in position 2 and got ✓, so it must be position 2).  
   _ E C _ _

3. A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3. Positions left: 1, 4, 5.

4. Letters already eliminated: B, F, H, N, R, T plus any others that must not repeat.

So the skeleton is now:  
A? E C A? _ or _ E C _ A

Letters still allowed (need two more unique ones from the remaining alphabet): D, G, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more unique letters to fill the blanks, neither of which has been ruled out.

Possible patterns to try:
- A E C _ _  (A in position 1)
- _ E C A _  (A in position 4)
- _ E C _ A  (A in position 5)

Let’s pick the most common remaining letters and build a valid word.

Take pattern _ E C A _ (A in position 4).  
We need a first and fifth letter from remaining pool.

Example: D E C A Y – uses D and Y (both allowed), fits all constraints.

Check:
- D: not yet ruled out.
- E: position 2 (✓).
- C: position 3 (✓).
- A: position 4 (allowed).
- Y: not yet ruled out.

This satisfies every constraint so far.
