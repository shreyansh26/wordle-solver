For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words.
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in or out of play.
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gained.

Common starting words include combinations like:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it hits several high-frequency consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E) without repeating any letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

So far we know:
- E is in the correct position (last letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

That rules out many common consonants and the vowel A.  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, H, G, B, F, M, P, etc.

I want a fresh set of letters that:
1. Uses E in the last spot (✓).
2. Avoids C, R, A, N.
3. Includes different consonants and at least one new vowel.

Good candidate structure: ? ? ? ? E  
Possible letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, G…

Let’s pick “STONE”:
- S, T, O, N, E
- N is already ruled out from CRANE’s feedback, so drop that.

Next pick: “SLIDE”:
- S, L, I, D, E
- Uses S, L, I, D which are all untested and avoids the banned letters.

I’ll go with SLIDE.

Current confirmed information:
- Letter positions: _ _ I _ E  
  (I is 3rd, E is 5th)
- Letters definitely out: C, R, A, N, S, D
- Letters confirmed in word but wrong spot: L

So we need a 5-letter word
– ending with I _ E (positions 3 & 5 are locked)
– containing L somewhere except position 2
– not containing C, R, A, N, S, D

Available letters (good frequency, no conflicts):
Vowels left: O, U  
Consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z

Likely pattern to try: _ L I _ E or _ _ I L E  
Valid 5-letter words with this pattern:
- BLITE (B, L, I, T, E) – but T is still allowed
- FLITE
- GLIDE – D is ruled out
- SLIME – S is ruled out
- OLIVE – O, L, I, V, E (L in 2nd spot, but feedback says L is in word but wrong position, so 2nd spot is not ruled out yet, only that L is not in the 2nd spot in SLIDE, but SLIDE had L in 2nd spot marked “-” meaning L is in word but not in position 2, so 2nd spot is definitely not L. So OLIVE has L in 2nd spot, which is invalid for L position)
- CLIME – C ruled out
- FLUTE – F, L, U, T, E

Let me check FLUTE:
F L U T E
- F, L, U, T, E
- Contains L (needs to be not in position 2)
- In FLUTE, L is in position 2, which we know is wrong (since SLIDE had L in 2nd with “-” meaning L exists but not in position 2)
- So FLUTE is invalid (L would be in position 2 again)

Next option: ELITE – but E is already fixed in 5, and can't have E in position 1
BULGE – no I
GUIL – too short
QUIET – Q not ruled out, but Q needs U, and we have I and E already, pattern would be QUITE or QUIET, but both have T which is still allowed. But let's see:
- QUIET: Q, U, I, E, T. But positions: _ _ I _ E, so QUIET would be Q U I E T, giving I in 3rd and E in 4th, but we know E is in 5th, so invalid.
- QUITE: Q U I T E – same issue, E is 4th, not 5th.

Another valid word: PIXIE – but P, I, X, I, E – has I twice, and we don't know if I can repeat
BLIMP – no E ending

Let's list possible words with pattern _ _ I _ E, containing L not in pos 2:
- FL I _ E: FLIVE is not valid
- GL I _ E: GL I V E – GLIVE not a word
- M I L E – but E is 4th
- M I L E – no
- T I L E – same issue with E position
- B I L E – E position wrong
- W I L E – same
- V I L E – same
- H I L E – not valid
- P I L E – same

Wait, maybe _ L _ I E pattern:
- B L O I E – not valid
- F L O I E – no
- G L O I E – no
- P L U I E – no

Another approach: use words like ""UTILE"" but that's U T I L E – E is 5th, I is 3rd, L is 4th. But feedback says L is in word but not in position 2 in SLIDE, but doesn't restrict 4th, so this could work.

UTILE:
U T I L E
- U (new), T (allowed), I (correct pos), L (allowed position), E (correct pos)
- No banned letters
- L is in 4th position, which is okay since feedback only ruled out L in 2nd

This seems valid.

G U I L E
- G U I L E
- G (allowed), U (new), I (3rd), L (4th), E (5th)
- L in 4th is allowed
