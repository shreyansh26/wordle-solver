For the first guess in Wordle, the goal is to maximize information gain. This means choosing a word that uses common letters and covers different positions effectively to eliminate as many possibilities as possible. 

Common strategies include using words with:
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular opening words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

""RAISE"" is also excellent as it covers R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. After considering these, I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes both R and S which are very frequent in English words, plus the vowels A, I, E.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ I _ _
- The letter S appears somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5
- The letters R, A, E are not in the word at all
- We need to explore new letters for the remaining positions

Good candidates for the remaining letters are common consonants and vowels that haven't been used yet. The unused common letters include:
- T, N, L, C, D, B, G, H, etc. for consonants
- O, U for vowels (since A and E are out, and I is already in place)

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps I in the 3rd position
- Uses S in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 5)
- Uses other common consonants/vowels not yet tested
- Avoids R, A, E

Possible word: STICK
- S in position 1 (testing if S can be first)
- T, C, K are common unused letters
- I stays in position 3
- This gives us new letters T, C, K to test and moves S to a new position

Another option: FOIST
But this uses F and O which are less common, and puts S in position 4 which we know is wrong.

STICK seems better as it tests more common letters.

Let me also consider:
- SNOUT: S in position 1, tests N, O, U, T
- SLING: S in position 1, tests L, N, G
- DOITS: S in position 5

But STICK is most straightforward with common letters.
