For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word has:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeating letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants. Another good option is ""RAISE"" which has similar properties. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it:
- Starts with A (very common)
- Has 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- Has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, S, E are not in the secret word at all (all marked ""x"").
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. It DOES contain O, but O is not the third letter.

We still have 5 guesses left. A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Contains O (since we know it's in the word)
- Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E
- Has new consonants to test (like T, N, L, C, M, etc.)
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, M, I, U, etc. A word like ""COUNT"" comes to mind:
- Contains O (known to be in word)
- Uses C, N, T, U (all common letters not yet tested)
- Avoids A, R, S, E
- O is in position 2 (different from last guess's position 3)

This should help narrow down possibilities further.

- N is in the word but not in position 4
- We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with letters not yet eliminated (avoiding A, R, S, E, U, T)

Let’s pick letters that are common and test new positions for N. We’ll try placing N in position 3, 4, or 5, but not 4 (since N(-) in position 4). Also, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Good candidates for positions 3, 4, 5: N, I, K, L, M, D, etc.

A word like “CONIC” is tempting, but it has I and C. However, C is already in position 1, so repeating C might not help. Instead, let’s try “CONIC” but realize C is already used in position 1, so we can’t have it again in position 5 (unless allowed, but usually Wordle doesn’t have double letters in secret words). 

Better to pick a word with no repeats and test new letters. A good next word is “COIND”:
- C and O are locked in positions 1 and 2
- I is a new vowel
- N is known to be in the word (not in position 4, so try position 3)
- D is a new consonant

But COIND is not a common word. Maybe “COIGN”? Still obscure. 

Let’s think of common words fitting C O _ _ _. Examples: “COBRA” (but R is out), “COMMA” (A is out), “COLIN” (I is fine, N is in word). 

“COLIN”:
- C(✓), O(✓), L(new), I(new), N(known to be in word, here in position 5)

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E

2. COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-) T(x)
   – Locked in: C at position 1, O at position 2
   – Eliminated letters now also include U, T
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. COLIN → C(✓) O(✓) L(x) I(✓) N(-)
   – L is eliminated (not in the word)
   – I is locked in at position 4
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because it was marked “-” here)

Therefore the current partial pattern is:
C O _ I _

and we know N must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (it cannot be 4 because I is already there, and it cannot be 1,2).

We have only positions 3 and 5 left to fill and one of them must be N.

Letters we may still use (not yet eliminated):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(basically anything except A, R, S, E, U, T, L)

Case 1: N is in position 3  
Pattern: C O N I _  
The final letter must be from the still-allowed set and cannot repeat.  
Possible word: we just need any valid 5-letter word fitting C O N I _.  
A quick mental scan turns up “CONIC” but C already appears at start.  
“CONIX” is not a word.  
“CONID” isn’t common.  
Actually the only reasonably common English word that fits C O N I _ is “CONIC”, but it repeats C.  
So let’s check the other case.

Case 2: N is in position 5  
Pattern: C O _ I N  
Now we need any letter (only one) for position 3 from the still-allowed set.  
Scanning letters in roughly frequency order:  
B → COBIN (not a common word)  
D → CODIN (rare)  
G → COGIN (rare)

J → COJIN (no)  
K → COKIN (no)  
M → COMIN (rare)  
P → COPIN (rare)  
V → COVIN (rare)  
D again? CODIN is not listed.  
But there is a common word: “COVIN” is archaic; “COPIN” isn’t standard.  
Wait: “COVIN” is acceptable in Scrabble but not everyday.  
Let me think again.  
Actually the only common everyday English word that fits C O _ I N is… “COVIN”?  
Hmm, none of these feel right.  
Let me re-scan:

- B: COBIN – no  
- D: CODIN – no  
- G: COGIN – no  
- H: Cohin – no  
- K: COKIN – no  
- M: COMIN – no  
- P: COPIN – no  
- V: COVIN – exists in Scrabble but very uncommon.

But there is one legitimate everyday word: “COVIN” is listed as an old legal term for a conspiracy, but it’s not common.

There is, however, “COGIN” which is nothing.

Wait, let’s check “COVIN” again – yes, it is recognized by major Scrabble dictionaries.  

I think among the limited options, “COVIN” is the most plausible real word.

Therefore I will guess COVIN and see what the feedback gives us.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word has:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeating letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants. Another good option is ""RAISE"" which has similar properties. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it:
- Starts with A (very common)
- Has 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- Has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, S, E are not in the secret word at all (all marked ""x"").
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

So we now know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
2. It DOES contain O, but O is not the third letter.

We still have 5 guesses left. A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Contains O (since we know it's in the word)
- Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E
- Has new consonants to test (like T, N, L, C, M, etc.)
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, M, I, U, etc. A word like ""COUNT"" comes to mind:
- Contains O (known to be in word)
- Uses C, N, T, U (all common letters not yet tested)
- Avoids A, R, S, E
- O is in position 2 (different from last guess's position 3)

This should help narrow down possibilities further.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters absent: A, R, S, E

2. COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-) T(x)
   - C is correct in position 1
   - O is correct in position 2
   - U and T are absent
   - N is present but not in position 4

So far we know:
- Pattern: C O _ _ _
- O is locked in position 2
- Letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- N is in the word but not in position 4
- We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with letters not yet eliminated (avoiding A, R, S, E, U, T)

Let’s pick letters that are common and test new positions for N. We’ll try placing N in position 3, 4, or 5, but not 4 (since N(-) in position 4). Also, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Good candidates for positions 3, 4, 5: N, I, K, L, M, D, etc.

A word like “CONIC” is tempting, but it has I and C. However, C is already in position 1, so repeating C might not help. Instead, let’s try “CONIC” but realize C is already used in position 1, so we can’t have it again in position 5 (unless allowed, but usually Wordle doesn’t have double letters in secret words). 

Better to pick a word with no repeats and test new letters. A good next word is “COIND”:
- C and O are locked in positions 1 and 2
- I is a new vowel
- N is known to be in the word (not in position 4, so try position 3)
- D is a new consonant

But COIND is not a common word. Maybe “COIGN”? Still obscure. 

Let’s think of common words fitting C O _ _ _. Examples: “COBRA” (but R is out), “COMMA” (A is out), “COLIN” (I is fine, N is in word). 

“COLIN”:
- C(✓), O(✓), L(new), I(new), N(known to be in word, here in position 5)
This tests:
- L and I as new letters
- N in position 5 (since it can’t be in 4)

This seems like a solid next guess.

Current locked-in letters and positions:

2: O ✓
4: I ✓

We also know:
- N is in the word but may NOT be in positions 4 or 5 (it was marked ""-"" in both COLIN and COVIN at position 5).  
  So N must be in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is:
C  O  N  I  _

Only position 5 is open, and we have already eliminated:
A, R, S, E, U, T, L, V

Still-allowed consonants or vowels for position 5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a real 5-letter word that starts “CONI-” and ends with one of those.

Common words:
- CONIC – repeats C (invalid)
- CONID – uncommon/obscure
- CONIX – not a word
But “CONIC” is the only dictionary entry that appears, and it re-uses C.

However, recalling basic English, there is “CONIC” (as in conic section) even with the double C; Wordle allows repeats unless explicitly forbidden.  
Let’s verify: “CONIC” is indeed in the official Wordle word list.

Therefore the only remaining likely candidate is:

C O N I C
