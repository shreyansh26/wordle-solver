For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Some good starting words include ""RAISE,"" ""ADIEU,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""AUDIO."" I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), providing good coverage for eliminating or confirming letters early on.

From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   – R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (R was 1st and 2nd in guesses 1 and 2, both got “-”).
   – A, I, S are NOT in the word.
   – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (it was 5th in raise, 3rd in trend).

2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
   – T is NOT in the word.
   – R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   – N is NOT in the word.
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely present: R, E, D
- Positions ruled out:
  – R ≠ 1, 2, 3 ⇒ R must be 4 or 5.
  – E ≠ 3, 5 ⇒ E must be 1, 2 or 4.
  – D ≠ 5 ⇒ D must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also eliminated letters so far: A, I, S, T, N.

Let’s look for 5-letter words using only the remaining alphabet (and containing R, E, D). Useful remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels O, U.

We need a word that has R, E, D and respects the positional constraints. One common word satisfying these is “HEROD”, but “HEROD” has O in position 4 and D in position 5, which violates D ≠ 5. Next candidate: “ORDER”.

Check “ORDER” against all constraints:
- Letters: O, R, D, E, R – all allowed.
- R appears in positions 2 and 5. We know R must be 4 or 5; 5 is allowed, and the first R in position 2 is new info – we will learn whether that placement is correct or just “wrong position”.
- E is in position 4 – allowed (E ≠ 3,5).
- D is in position 3 – allowed (D ≠ 5).

So “ORDER” is a valid next guess that respects every known constraint and tests new positions for R, E, D.

We now have the following information:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)

2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
   - D must be in the word but not in position 5 (it was in position 5 here got “-”).
   - E must be in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 here got “-”).
   - R must be in the word but not in position 2 (it was in position 2 here got “-”).
   - T and N are NOT in the word.

3. ORDER → O(✓) R(-) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (it was in position 2 here got “-”).
   - D is in the word and in the correct position 3.
   - E is in the word and in the correct position 4.
   - R is in the word and in the correct position 5.

From this, we can reconstruct the word:
- Position 1: O (✓)
- Position 2: must be some letter (not R, since R(-) in position 2).
- Position 3: D (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

So the word is O ? D E R.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with O and ends with DER. Common such words include:
- ODDER

- ORDER (but we already know ORDER was a guess, so it must be one of the others)
- ONDER (not a valid English word)
- OXDER (not a valid English word)

Between ODDER and OLDER, both are valid. But since we have no constraints on the second letter yet, both are possible. However, we should choose one that tests the remaining possible letters. 

Looking at the letters used so far:
- Eliminated: A, I, S, T, N
- Used in feedback: R, E, D, O
- Remaining common letters: L, V, G, B, C, F, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y

Between ODDER and OLDER, OLDER uses L, which is common and hasn't been tested yet. ODDER uses D again, which we already know is in position 3. Thus, OLDER is a better guess to test the second letter.

Therefore, the next guess should be OLDER.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), providing good coverage for eliminating or confirming letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (RAISE) we learned:
- R appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in the 1st position.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E appears somewhere in the word, but NOT in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, I, or S.
2. Contains R somewhere other than position 1.
3. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.

To avoid A, I, S and use common letters, I’ll try a word with O, T, N, L, D, etc., while ensuring R and E are placed in new positions. Candidate words could be ""ROUTE,"" ""TREND,"" ""OLDER,"" etc. All have E not in position 5 and R not in position 1.

I’ll choose ""TREND"":
- T (new letter)
- R (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- E (known to be in the word, now in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- D (new letter)

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   – R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (R was 1st and 2nd in guesses 1 and 2, both got “-”).
   – A, I, S are NOT in the word.
   – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (it was 5th in raise, 3rd in trend).

2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
   – T is NOT in the word.
   – R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   – N is NOT in the word.
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely present: R, E, D
- Positions ruled out:
  – R ≠ 1, 2, 3 ⇒ R must be 4 or 5.
  – E ≠ 3, 5 ⇒ E must be 1, 2 or 4.
  – D ≠ 5 ⇒ D must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also eliminated letters so far: A, I, S, T, N.

Let’s look for 5-letter words using only the remaining alphabet (and containing R, E, D). Useful remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels O, U.

We need a word that has R, E, D and respects the positional constraints. One common word satisfying these is “HEROD”, but “HEROD” has O in position 4 and D in position 5, which violates D ≠ 5. Next candidate: “ORDER”.

Check “ORDER” against all constraints:
- Letters: O, R, D, E, R – all allowed.
- R appears in positions 2 and 5. We know R must be 4 or 5; 5 is allowed, and the first R in position 2 is new info – we will learn whether that placement is correct or just “wrong position”.
- E is in position 4 – allowed (E ≠ 3,5).
- D is in position 3 – allowed (D ≠ 5).

So “ORDER” is a valid next guess that respects every known constraint and tests new positions for R, E, D.

   - E is in the word and in the correct position 4.

From this, we can reconstruct the word:

- Position 2: must be some letter (not R, since R(-) in position 2).
- Position 3: D (✓)

- ODDER – but D is already in position 3 and we saw no indication of a double D.
- OCDER – invalid
- OFDER – invalid
- OHDER – invalid
- OMDER – invalid
- OP DER – invalid
- OUDER – invalid
- OVDER – invalid
- OWDER – invalid
- OYDER – invalid

Looking carefully, the only real English word fitting O _ D E R is “ODDER”. Despite the double D, it’s valid and hasn’t been explicitly ruled out.

Let’s guess “ODDER”.

- Position 1: O (✓) – correct
- Position 2: L (x) – L is NOT in the word
- Position 3: D (✓) – correct
- Position 4: E (✓) – correct
- Position 5: R (✓) – correct

So the word looks like O _ D E R, where the blank must be a letter that:
- Has not yet been ruled out (not A, I, S, T, N, L)
- Makes a valid 5-letter English word.
