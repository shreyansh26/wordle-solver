Since this is the first guess with no prior information to work from, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
4. Use frequently appearing consonants

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B
A strong starting word could be ""AROSE"" because:
- Contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Forms a valid English word

Other good options include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, etc. I'll go with AROSE as it's often considered one of the best starting words.

The feedback from AROSE shows:
- A exists in the word but not in position 1
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word has an A, but not in position 1
2. It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
3. The remaining letters we haven't tested yet are most of the consonants and other vowels

Good letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Since A is in the word (but not first), I should try placing it in other positions.

A common strategy is to test new letters while placing the known good letter (A) in a new spot. I'll try a word that:
- Puts A in position 2 (since it can't be 1st)
- Uses other common untested letters
- Avoids R, O, S, E

Good candidates: CANDY (but Y is less common), FAULT (but U is less common), HAUNT (but U less common), PLANT, CHANT

Next step:
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Try to place A in position 2 again (could still be right), while testing 4 brand-new consonants/vowels.
- A good word should use common remaining letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.) and avoid everything already eliminated.

From the new feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - A is in position 2 (✓).
   - Y is in position 5 (✓).

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - R, O, S, E, C, H, N, T, B, D, L

3. Letters still unknown:
   - F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any repeats allowed by the remaining slots).

4. Current word skeleton:
   - _ A _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that have not been eliminated and that make a valid English word. We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common remaining letters: F, G, I, K, M, P, U, W

Possible candidates:
- F: FAIRY, FAKEY (but E is eliminated), FAKY (not valid)
- G: GAUZY (but U and Z are possible), GAILY (but L is eliminated), GAMAY (but M and Y are possible)
- M: MAULY (but L is eliminated), MAMMY (repeats M), MAFIA (but I is possible), MAGMA (but G and M are possible)
- P: PATTY (but T is eliminated), PANSY (but N and S are eliminated)
- K: KAURI (but U, R, I are possible), KAPPA (but P and A repeats), KAYAK (but K repeats)
- W: WAULY (but L is eliminated), WACKY (but C is eliminated), WAXY (but X and Y are possible)

Looking at valid words:
- FAIRY: F, A, I, R, Y – but R is eliminated.
- MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A – but A repeats and we need to test new letters.
- GAMAY: G, A, M, A, Y – but A repeats.
- KAYAK: K, A, Y, A, K – but A and K repeat.
- WACKY: W, A, C, K, Y – but C is eliminated.
- KAPPA: K, A, P, P, A – but A and P repeat.
- GAILY: G, A, I, L, Y – but L is eliminated.
- GAMMY: G, A, M, M, Y – but M repeats.

A better approach: use three new unique letters in positions 1, 3, 4. Let's try:
- G, I, M: G A I M Y → GAIMY (but this is not a valid word).
- F, I, M: F A I M Y → FAIMY (invalid).
- K, I, M: K A I M Y → KAIMY (invalid).
- W, I, M: W A I M Y → WAIMY (invalid).

Hmm, these are not valid. Maybe another set:
- M, I, X: M A I X Y → MAIXY (invalid).
- P, I, G: P A I G Y → PAIGY (invalid).

Let me think of valid English words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use only remaining letters:
- G: GAUZY (G, A, U, Z, Y) – uses G, A, U, Z, Y. All letters are possible (G, U, Z not yet tested).
- K: KAURI (K, A, U, R, I) – but R is eliminated.
- P: PATTY – but T is eliminated.
- F: FAIRY – but R is eliminated.
- W: WACKY – but C is eliminated.
- M: MAUVE (but E is eliminated), MAJOR (but J, O, R are problematic).
- V: VAPID (but P, I, D are possible, but word is VAPID – 5 letters, but must end with Y).

Looking again, GAUZY seems to be the only valid word that fits the pattern and uses new letters. Let's check:
- G, A, U, Z, Y: 
   - A and Y confirmed at positions 2 and 5.
   - G, U, Z are new letters to test.
   - No eliminated letters used.

Therefore, GAUZY is a good next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,mammy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
4. Use frequently appearing consonants

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B
A strong starting word could be ""AROSE"" because:
- Contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Forms a valid English word

Other good options include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, etc. I'll go with AROSE as it's often considered one of the best starting words.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE shows:
- A exists in the word but not in position 1
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word has an A, but not in position 1
2. It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
3. The remaining letters we haven't tested yet are most of the consonants and other vowels

Good letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Since A is in the word (but not first), I should try placing it in other positions.

A common strategy is to test new letters while placing the known good letter (A) in a new spot. I'll try a word that:
- Puts A in position 2 (since it can't be 1st)
- Uses other common untested letters
- Avoids R, O, S, E

Good candidates: CANDY (but Y is less common), FAULT (but U is less common), HAUNT (but U less common), PLANT, CHANT

I'll go with CHANT because:
- Places A in position 2
- Tests C, H, N, T (all common)
- Avoids all eliminated letters

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. A is definitely in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (feedback from AROSE and CHANT both show “-” for A).
2. Letters R, O, S, E, C, H, N, T are NOT in the word at all.
3. We still need to test letters that have not appeared in guesses so far: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any repeats allowed by the remaining positions.

Next step:
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Try to place A in position 2 again (could still be right), while testing 4 brand-new consonants/vowels.
- A good word should use common remaining letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.) and avoid everything already eliminated.

Candidate word: AMBID (but I is not tested yet) – but D is useful.
Another candidate: BAGGY – but G repeats, wasting info.
Best simple option: BADLY – uses B, D, L, Y and places A in position 2.

But we need to make sure we aren’t repeating eliminated letters and we’re testing new ones.
Re-checking:
- B, A, D, L, Y – none have been eliminated yet.
- A is placed in position 2 (still possible).

Therefore, BADLY is a solid next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,mammy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information to work from, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
4. Use frequently appearing consonants

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B
A strong starting word could be ""AROSE"" because:
- Contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Forms a valid English word

Other good options include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, etc. I'll go with AROSE as it's often considered one of the best starting words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE shows:
- A exists in the word but not in position 1
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word has an A, but not in position 1
2. It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
3. The remaining letters we haven't tested yet are most of the consonants and other vowels

Good letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Since A is in the word (but not first), I should try placing it in other positions.

A common strategy is to test new letters while placing the known good letter (A) in a new spot. I'll try a word that:
- Puts A in position 2 (since it can't be 1st)
- Uses other common untested letters
- Avoids R, O, S, E

Good candidates: CANDY (but Y is less common), FAULT (but U is less common), HAUNT (but U less common), PLANT, CHANT

I'll go with CHANT because:
- Places A in position 2
- Tests C, H, N, T (all common)
- Avoids all eliminated letters

<guess>CHANT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHANT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. A is definitely in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (feedback from AROSE and CHANT both show “-” for A).
2. Letters R, O, S, E, C, H, N, T are NOT in the word at all.
3. We still need to test letters that have not appeared in guesses so far: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any repeats allowed by the remaining positions.

Next step:
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Try to place A in position 2 again (could still be right), while testing 4 brand-new consonants/vowels.
- A good word should use common remaining letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.) and avoid everything already eliminated.

Candidate word: AMBID (but I is not tested yet) – but D is useful.
Another candidate: BAGGY – but G repeats, wasting info.
Best simple option: BADLY – uses B, D, L, Y and places A in position 2.

But we need to make sure we aren’t repeating eliminated letters and we’re testing new ones.
Re-checking:
- B, A, D, L, Y – none have been eliminated yet.
- A is placed in position 2 (still possible).

Therefore, BADLY is a solid next guess.

3. Letters still unknown:
   - F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any repeats allowed by the remaining slots).

4. Current word skeleton:
   - _ A _ _ Y

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that have not been eliminated and that make a valid English word. We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common remaining letters: F, G, I, K, M, P, U, W

Possible candidates:
- F: FAIRY, FAKEY (but E is eliminated), FAKY (not valid)
- G: GAUZY (but U and Z are possible), GAILY (but L is eliminated), GAMAY (but M and Y are possible)
- M: MAULY (but L is eliminated), MAMMY (repeats M), MAFIA (but I is possible), MAGMA (but G and M are possible)
- P: PATTY (but T is eliminated), PANSY (but N and S are eliminated)
- K: KAURI (but U, R, I are possible), KAPPA (but P and A repeats), KAYAK (but K repeats)
- W: WAULY (but L is eliminated), WACKY (but C is eliminated), WAXY (but X and Y are possible)

Looking at valid words:
- FAIRY: F, A, I, R, Y – but R is eliminated.
- MAFIA: M, A, F, I, A – but A repeats and we need to test new letters.
- GAMAY: G, A, M, A, Y – but A repeats.
- KAYAK: K, A, Y, A, K – but A and K repeat.
- WACKY: W, A, C, K, Y – but C is eliminated.
- KAPPA: K, A, P, P, A – but A and P repeat.
- GAILY: G, A, I, L, Y – but L is eliminated.
- GAMMY: G, A, M, M, Y – but M repeats.

A better approach: use three new unique letters in positions 1, 3, 4. Let's try:
- G, I, M: G A I M Y → GAIMY (but this is not a valid word).
- F, I, M: F A I M Y → FAIMY (invalid).
- K, I, M: K A I M Y → KAIMY (invalid).
- W, I, M: W A I M Y → WAIMY (invalid).

Hmm, these are not valid. Maybe another set:
- M, I, X: M A I X Y → MAIXY (invalid).
- P, I, G: P A I G Y → PAIGY (invalid).

Let me think of valid English words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use only remaining letters:
- G: GAUZY (G, A, U, Z, Y) – uses G, A, U, Z, Y. All letters are possible (G, U, Z not yet tested).
- K: KAURI (K, A, U, R, I) – but R is eliminated.
- P: PATTY – but T is eliminated.
- F: FAIRY – but R is eliminated.
- W: WACKY – but C is eliminated.
- M: MAUVE (but E is eliminated), MAJOR (but J, O, R are problematic).
- V: VAPID (but P, I, D are possible, but word is VAPID – 5 letters, but must end with Y).

Looking again, GAUZY seems to be the only valid word that fits the pattern and uses new letters. Let's check:
- G, A, U, Z, Y: 
   - A and Y confirmed at positions 2 and 5.
   - G, U, Z are new letters to test.
   - No eliminated letters used.

Therefore, GAUZY is a good next guess.

- KAMPY – not a standard word.

- VAMPY – ends in Y, uses V, A, M, P, Y. V, M, P are all new, and word is valid.

""VAMPY"" is a recognized 5-letter word, uses only letters not yet eliminated, and places A and Y in the required spots.

Current constraints:

- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, C, H, N, T, B, D, L, G, U, Z, V, P
- Available letters: F, I, K, W, X
- Positions still unknown: 1 and 4

We need two more letters from {F, I, K, W, X} to fill positions 1 and 4, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: F, I, K, W
- Position 4: F, I, K, W (can be same as pos 1 or different)

Looking for valid words:
- FAMIX – invalid
- KAMIK – uses K twice (invalid)
- WAMIX – invalid
- KAMFI – invalid
- FAMKI – invalid
- WAMKI – invalid
- KAMWY – invalid
- FAMKY – invalid
- FAMWI – invalid

Only valid word fitting _ A M _ Y with remaining letters: KAFIR (but R is eliminated)

Wait, let me reconsider. The valid word must be:
- Position 1: F, I, K, W
- Position 4: F, I, K, W
- Using only remaining letters

Looking at common words:
- WAMFY – invalid
- FAMIX – invalid
- KAMFI – invalid
- FAMKI – invalid
- KAMWI – invalid
- WAMKI – invalid

Actually, the only valid word seems to be KAMIK (though it repeats K, which is allowed, and KAMIK is a valid word meaning ""Inuit boot"").

But checking dictionary, KAMIK is valid (5 letters, fits pattern _ A M _ Y).

So the word is KAMIK, testing K in positions 1 and 4.

But wait, looking again, KAMIK has K in both positions 1 and 4, which is allowed since we haven't confirmed any letter positions for these spots.

However, there's another valid word: KAMFI (though less common), but KAMIK is more recognized.

Actually, let me check FAMIX – no, that's invalid.

The most valid word appears to be KAMIK.

But let me think differently - maybe I missed some letters. Looking back at eliminated letters, Q and X are also available.

But Q needs U which is eliminated, so Q is not possible. X is available but unlikely in this pattern.

Therefore, KAMIK seems to be the only valid option here.

Wait, let me double-check the pattern: _ A M _ Y

Available letters: F, I, K, W, X

Possible valid words:
- KAMIK – K A M I K (valid 5-letter word)
- FAMIX – not valid
- WAMIX – not valid
- KAMFI – not valid

So KAMIK is the logical choice.

But looking at the pattern, position 4 must be a letter from {F, I, K, W, X}, and position 1 must be from {F, I, K, W}.

KAMIK uses K in position 1 and K in position 4, which is allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is KAMIK.

Based on all prior feedback, the word must be _ A M _ Y with A, M, and Y locked in those exact spots. Eliminated letters now include R, O, S, E, C, H, N, T, B, D, L, G, U, Z, V, P.

The only remaining letters that can fill positions 1 and 4 are F, I, K, W, X. The only valid English word matching _ A M _ Y with these letters is:
