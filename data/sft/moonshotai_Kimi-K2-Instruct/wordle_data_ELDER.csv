Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives a high chance of hitting some letters in the word and narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback:
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
O(x) – O is not in the word.
S(x) – S is not in the word.
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Keeps R out of position 2
- Keeps E out of position 5

Good candidate consonants still allowed: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good candidate vowels still allowed: I, U

A word that fits these constraints well is “TREND”:
- It contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- It avoids A, O, S
- It uses common letters (T, N, D) to test more possibilities

Note: R is in position 2 in “TREND” but that’s acceptable because the feedback only said R is not in position 2 of the previous word “AROSE”. The feedback doesn’t restrict it from being in position 2 in a new word.

Upon re-reading the feedback: “R(-)” means R is in the word but not in the position it was guessed (position 2). So in a new word, R can still appear in any other position (1,3,4,5). In “TREND”, R is in position 2, which is the same position as in “AROSE”. That would be invalid because the feedback already told us R is not in position 2. So “TREND” is invalid.

Revised candidate: “REACT” – but it contains A which is known to be absent.

Next candidate: “NERVE”
- Contains R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (valid)
- E is in positions 2 and 5 – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is invalid.

- Contains R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- E in position 2 (valid, since feedback only ruled out position 5 for E)

Seems good.

- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Keeps R out of position 2
- Keeps E out of position 5

Good candidate consonants still allowed: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good candidate vowels still allowed: I, U

A word that fits these constraints well is “TREND”:
- It contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- It avoids A, O, S
- It uses common letters (T, N, D) to test more possibilities

Note: R is in position 2 in “TREND” but that’s acceptable because the feedback only said R is not in position 2 of the previous word “AROSE”. The feedback doesn’t restrict it from being in position 2 in a new word.

Upon re-reading the feedback: “R(-)” means R is in the word but not in the position it was guessed (position 2). So in a new word, R can still appear in any other position (1,3,4,5). In “TREND”, R is in position 2, which is the same position as in “AROSE”. That would be invalid because the feedback already told us R is not in position 2. So “TREND” is invalid.

Revised candidate: “REACT” – but it contains A which is known to be absent.

Next candidate: “NERVE”
- Contains R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (valid)
- E is in positions 2 and 5 – but E cannot be in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “PERCH”
- Contains R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R in position 3 (valid)
- E in position 2 (valid, since feedback only ruled out position 5 for E)
- Uses new letters P, C, H to test

Seems good.

Let me double-check:
- P, E, R, C, H
- No A, O, S
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5

“PERCH” fits all constraints.

From Guess 2 (PERCH):  
- P, C, H are NOT in the word.  
- E and R ARE in the word, but not in the positions they appeared in PERCH (so E ≠ position 2, R ≠ position 3).

Collecting all constraints so far:
Letters definitely in the word: R, E  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, C, H  
Allowed positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3) → actually, from guess 1: R ≠ 2; from guess 2: R ≠ 3 → R must be in 1, 4, or 5  
Allowed positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 5 from guess 1 and cannot be 2 from guess 2) → E must be in 1, 3, or 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E exactly once each  
- Does not contain A, O, S, P, C, H  
- Places R in 1, 4, or 5  
- Places E in 1, 3, or 4  
- No repeating letters (standard Wordle rules)

Looking at common letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s try “URBAN” – but A is forbidden.  
Try “BURNT” – N is allowed, but T is allowed. Let’s check:
B, U, R, N, T  
- Contains R and E? No, it lacks E.

Possible combinations:

Scanning mental dictionary:
- EMBER – contains M, B, E, R; all letters allowed, fits pattern (E M B E R) but E repeats, which is usually allowed in Wordle unless we’ve seen double-letters ruled out (haven’t). However, the feedback so far only indicates single instances, so let’s avoid repeats to be safe.
- ELVER – but V is allowed, L, E, R allowed. Fits E L V E R – again E repeats.  
- ELDER – E repeats.  
- EDGER – G allowed, but E repeats.  
- EIDER – repeats E.  
- ELDER – repeats E.  
- EMBER – repeats E.  

The only non-repeating-letter candidate that comes to mind is:
EGLER – but this isn’t a recognized word.

Actually, looking again, a valid word is:
EVERY – but Y is forbidden.  
EGGER – repeats G and E.  
EWERS – but S is forbidden.  

Realizing that most common words fitting E _ _ _ R contain another E. The best valid word with no repeat letters is **EMBER**, despite the double E, as Wordle allows repeats unless feedback indicates otherwise.

However, let’s try a better alternative:

E G G A R – A forbidden.  

Re-evaluate: The only plausible English word fitting E _ _ _ R without forbidden letters and without repeats is **ELBOW** – but it ends in W, not R.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters known to be in the word and in their exact positions:
   - E is in position 1.
   - R is in position 5.

2. The word therefore has the pattern: E _ _ _ R

3. Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all guesses):
   A, O, S, P, C, H, N, T, Y, M, B

4. Letters still allowed (i.e., 5-letter English alphabet minus the forbidden ones):
   D, F, G, I, K, L, U, V, W, X, Z

5. We now need a 5-letter English word that starts with E, ends with R, and uses only letters from the allowed list for the middle three positions.

Scanning the mental dictionary:
- ELDER – contains D (allowed) and L (allowed) but E repeats (position 1 and 4). However, Wordle allows repeats, and there's no feedback ruling out a second E. But we already have R at position 5, so this would be E L D E R. This has E at 1 and 4, which is valid.
- EAGER – A is forbidden.
- EIDER – D allowed, but I allowed, E repeats.
- ETHER – H is forbidden.
- EVERT – T is forbidden.
- EGGAR – G is allowed but A is forbidden.
- ELDER seems the only valid word fitting E _ _ _ R with allowed letters.

Let's confirm ELDER:
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R
- All letters are from the allowed set (D and L are okay, others already confirmed).
- Pattern: E L D E R fits E _ _ _ R.

No other obvious valid words fit better.
