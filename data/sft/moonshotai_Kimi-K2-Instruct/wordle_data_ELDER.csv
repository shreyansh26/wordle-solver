This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear in many English words (vowels and frequent consonants)
2. Include a variety of different letters to test as many possibilities as possible
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular and effective starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- No repeated letters
- It tests 5 different letters in one go

This gives me a solid foundation to analyze common letters and their positions.

From the feedback so far:

1. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): C, A, N, F, S, H  
2. Letters that **must** be in the word but whose exact positions we still need to discover: R and E  
   - From CRANE: R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5  
   - From FRESH: R is not in position 2 (confirmed), E is not in position 3  

So the word must contain both R and E somewhere, and none of C, A, N, F, S, H.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A, E are either forbidden or already known to be included)

We have 5 slots to fill with these letters, ensuring:
- R and E each appear exactly once
- No forbidden letters
- R not in position 2, E not in position 3 or 5

A good next guess should:
1. Place R and E in still-legal positions
2. Introduce several new letters we haven’t tested
3. Use common letters to maximize information

Possible patterns:
- R in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (but position 5 must hold E if E is there)
- E in 1, 2, 3 or 4 (but we know E not in 3 or 5)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these constraints. One that immediately comes to mind is “DRIVE”.

Check:
- Letters: D, R, I, V, E  
  – D, I, V are new  
  – R and E are required  
- R is in position 2 – but earlier feedback said R is **not** in position 2. So “DRIVE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRIPE”
Check:
- Letters: G, R, I, P, E  
  – G, I, P are new  
  – R and E required  
- R in 2 – again invalid.

Next: “TRIBE”
Check:
- T, R, I, B, E  
  – T, I, B are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 2 – still invalid.

Next: “PERKY”
Check:
- P, E, R, K, Y  
  – P, K, Y are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 3 – allowed  
- E is in position 2 – allowed

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Another option: “TOWER”  
Check:
- T, O, W, E, R  
- R in 5 – allowed  
- E in 4 – allowed  
- T, O, W new  
- No forbidden letters  

Either “PERKY” or “TOWER” is a good candidate.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: FRESH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): C, A, N, F, S, H  
2. Letters that **must** be in the word but whose exact positions we still need to discover: R and E  
   - From CRANE: R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5  
   - From FRESH: R is not in position 2 (confirmed), E is not in position 3  

So the word must contain both R and E somewhere, and none of C, A, N, F, S, H.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A, E are either forbidden or already known to be included)

We have 5 slots to fill with these letters, ensuring:
- R and E each appear exactly once
- No forbidden letters
- R not in position 2, E not in position 3 or 5

A good next guess should:
1. Place R and E in still-legal positions
2. Introduce several new letters we haven’t tested
3. Use common letters to maximize information

Possible patterns:
- R in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (but position 5 must hold E if E is there)
- E in 1, 2, 3 or 4 (but we know E not in 3 or 5)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these constraints. One that immediately comes to mind is “DRIVE”.

Check:
- Letters: D, R, I, V, E  
  – D, I, V are new  
  – R and E are required  
- R is in position 2 – but earlier feedback said R is **not** in position 2. So “DRIVE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRIPE”
Check:
- Letters: G, R, I, P, E  
  – G, I, P are new  
  – R and E required  
- R in 2 – again invalid.

Next: “TRIBE”
Check:
- T, R, I, B, E  
  – T, I, B are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 2 – still invalid.

Next: “PERKY”
Check:
- P, E, R, K, Y  
  – P, K, Y are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 3 – allowed  
- E is in position 2 – allowed  
- No forbidden letters  
- 5 distinct letters – good

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Another option: “TOWER”  
Check:
- T, O, W, E, R  
- R in 5 – allowed  
- E in 4 – allowed  
- T, O, W new  
- No forbidden letters  

Either “PERKY” or “TOWER” is a good candidate.  
I’ll choose “TOWER” because it places E in a new position (4) and R in a new position (5), and tests the new letters T, O, W.

From the new feedback on TOWER we now know:

1. Letters that are **in the word and in the correct position**:
   - E is in position 4.
   - R is in position 5.

2. Letters that are **not in the word at all** (accumulated so far):

3. Letters that **must still appear somewhere** in the word:
   None besides the already-placed E (4) and R (5).

4. Therefore the hidden word has the pattern:
   _ _ _ E R

5. We still need to determine the first three letters from the remaining unused letters:
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- No repeated letters
- It tests 5 different letters in one go

This gives me a solid foundation to analyze common letters and their positions.

A(x) – A is **not** in the word.  
N(x) – N is **not** in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word, but **not in position 5**.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E (but not in positions 2 or 5).
- It does **not** contain C, A, or N.

Goal: pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and E (but in new positions).
2. Uses new letters for the remaining slots, avoiding C, A, N.
3. Uses common English letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:

- BREAD – has A (invalid)  
- TREAD – has A (invalid)  
- GREET – repeats E (inefficient)

Next: “TRIBE”
Check:

  – R and E required  
- R is in position 3 – allowed

- No forbidden letters  
- 5 distinct letters – good

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear in many English words (vowels and frequent consonants)
2. Include a variety of different letters to test as many possibilities as possible
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular and effective starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- No repeated letters
- It tests 5 different letters in one go

This gives me a solid foundation to analyze common letters and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:

C(x) – C is **not** in the word at all.  
R(-) – R is in the word, but **not in position 2**.  
A(x) – A is **not** in the word.  
N(x) – N is **not** in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word, but **not in position 5**.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E (but not in positions 2 or 5).
- It does **not** contain C, A, or N.

Goal: pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and E (but in new positions).
2. Uses new letters for the remaining slots, avoiding C, A, N.
3. Uses common English letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:  
- STORM – uses S, T, O, R, M (but O and M are new; R is in position 3)  
- BREAD – has A (invalid)  
- TREAD – has A (invalid)  
- GREET – repeats E (inefficient)  
- FRESH – has S, H, R, E, F (R and E in new positions; no C, A, N)

FRESH seems strong:
- R is in position 3 (not 2).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- Introduces F, S, H as new letters.

I’ll guess FRESH.

<guess>FRESH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: FRESH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): C, A, N, F, S, H  
2. Letters that **must** be in the word but whose exact positions we still need to discover: R and E  
   - From CRANE: R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5  
   - From FRESH: R is not in position 2 (confirmed), E is not in position 3  

So the word must contain both R and E somewhere, and none of C, A, N, F, S, H.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A, E are either forbidden or already known to be included)

We have 5 slots to fill with these letters, ensuring:
- R and E each appear exactly once
- No forbidden letters
- R not in position 2, E not in position 3 or 5

A good next guess should:
1. Place R and E in still-legal positions
2. Introduce several new letters we haven’t tested
3. Use common letters to maximize information

Possible patterns:
- R in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (but position 5 must hold E if E is there)
- E in 1, 2, 3 or 4 (but we know E not in 3 or 5)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these constraints. One that immediately comes to mind is “DRIVE”.

Check:
- Letters: D, R, I, V, E  
  – D, I, V are new  
  – R and E are required  
- R is in position 2 – but earlier feedback said R is **not** in position 2. So “DRIVE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRIPE”
Check:
- Letters: G, R, I, P, E  
  – G, I, P are new  
  – R and E required  
- R in 2 – again invalid.

Next: “TRIBE”
Check:
- T, R, I, B, E  
  – T, I, B are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 2 – still invalid.

Next: “PERKY”
Check:
- P, E, R, K, Y  
  – P, K, Y are new  
  – R and E required  
- R is in position 3 – allowed  
- E is in position 2 – allowed  
- No forbidden letters  
- 5 distinct letters – good

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Another option: “TOWER”  
Check:
- T, O, W, E, R  
- R in 5 – allowed  
- E in 4 – allowed  
- T, O, W new  
- No forbidden letters  

Either “PERKY” or “TOWER” is a good candidate.  
I’ll choose “TOWER” because it places E in a new position (4) and R in a new position (5), and tests the new letters T, O, W.

<guess>TOWER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: FRESH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) E(-) S(x) H(x)
Guess 3: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TOWER we now know:

1. Letters that are **in the word and in the correct position**:
   - E is in position 4.
   - R is in position 5.

2. Letters that are **not in the word at all** (accumulated so far):
   C, A, N, F, S, H, T, O, W

3. Letters that **must still appear somewhere** in the word:
   None besides the already-placed E (4) and R (5).

4. Therefore the hidden word has the pattern:
   _ _ _ E R

5. We still need to determine the first three letters from the remaining unused letters:
   - Remaining consonants: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z
   - Remaining vowels: I, U

We need a common 5-letter English word that ends in “E R” and uses only the still-allowed letters.  
Quick brainstorm:

- B I K E R → BIKER  
- L I V E R → LIVER  
- G I V E R → GIVER  
- D I V E R → DIVER  
- P I P E R → PIPER  
- R I V E R → invalid (R already used once)  
- V I D E R → not a word  
- M I N E R → invalid (N already banned)  

BIKER and LIVER look like the strongest candidates.  
“LIVER” uses L, I, V – all still allowed and not yet tested.  
“BIKER” uses B, I, K – also all allowed.

I’ll choose LIVER because it introduces three new letters at once and is a common word.

- Letters still unused (possible for positions 1 and 3): D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that ends in “L _ E R” and uses only the still-allowed letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible choices:
- D L G E R – not a word  
- G L O W E R – invalid (O, W already banned)
