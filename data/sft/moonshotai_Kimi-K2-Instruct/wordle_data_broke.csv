For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me eliminate or confirm as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The classic Wordle starting words are things like ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers:
- The vowels A, O, E
- Common consonants R and S
This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- R is in the correct spot (position 2).
- O and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is ? R ? ? ?
- It contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need to place O and E in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback)

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3 or 5)
- E could be in 1, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let's think of words that fit ? R ? ? ? with O and E in valid spots, and no A or S.

Some possibilities:
- BROKE: O in 3 is invalid (from feedback)
- PROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- CRORE: uses O and E but E is in 5 which is invalid
- FRERE: uses E twice but E can't be in 5
- TROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 is invalid

Looking at other combinations:
- We need O in 1 or 4, and E in 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the same position as O).

Let's try:
- ORCLE: O in 1, E missing
- OREXX: needs a real word
- PERON: but P is position 1, E in 3, R in 2, O in 4, N in 5 → PERON? But does it have the letters?
Wait, we need R in 2, and contain O and E.

Valid word: PRONE
- P (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
Next: GROIN - has I which we don't know about
DROOL - has double O
TRODE - O in 3 invalid
FRORE - has double R
DROME - O in 3 invalid
CRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is tricky. Let me think differently - maybe E is in 3 and O is in 1 or 4.

Word structure: ? R E ? ? or ? R ? ? E (but E can't be in 5), so ? R E ? ?

Possible letters for other positions (excluding A,S): common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let's try:
- BREED: has double E
- CREEK: has E in 3, but K is possible
- FREED: has E in 3, but D is possible
- GREED: has double E
- TREED: has E in 3, D at end

But we need O somewhere. The word must contain O.

So we need: ? R ? ? ? with O and E somewhere, O not 3, E not 5.

Let me think of words with O in 1 and E in 3,4:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not a word
- O R ? E ? : ORIEL? But has A (invalid), no A
- O R ? ? E : invalid as E can't be 5

O in 4:
- ? R ? O ? 
Need E in 1 or 3:
- E R ? O ? : ERODE? O in 4, E in 1 - but O is supposed to be in word but in wrong position (from AROSE it was in 3, now in 4 - that's allowed)

ERODE:
- E (1), R (2), O (4), D (5), E (3) - has two Es, but original word might have doubles
But we don't know if E is duplicated. 

FROND - has O in 4, R in 2, but is missing E
BRONX - not a word
DRONE - O in 4, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5
CRONE - O in 3 invalid
PRONE - O in 3 invalid
TRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is harder than expected. Let me try E in 3, O in 1:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not valid
- O R E D ? : OREDA? No
- O R E T ? : ORET? No

Another approach: Use common words with R in 2, O and E elsewhere.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with R in 2:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid
- CRORE: O in 3 invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 invalid
- TROPE: O in 3 invalid

Alternative: Maybe the word is ? R ? O E, but E can't be 5
Or ? R E O ?: but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 4 - that's allowed as shift
Word: TREND? No O
CREDO: O in 4, R in 2, E in 3 - but D is extra
CREDO has:
C (1), R (2), E (3), D (4), O (5) - but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 5 - allowed
E was in 5 in AROSE, now in 3 - allowed
But we need to check if all letters are valid (no A or S)

CREDO:
- Letters: C, R, E, D, O - none are A or S
- R is in correct spot (2)
- O was in 3, now in 5 - wrong position (allowed)
- E was in 5, now in 3 - wrong position (allowed)
- C and D are new, which is fine

This seems like a valid next guess that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

But let me reconsider if there are better options. Another candidate is ""TROVE"":
- T (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
""GROPE"" - same issue with O in 3
""CRONE"" - O in 3 invalid

After careful consideration, ""CREDO"" seems to be a valid next guess that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Places O and E in new positions (5 and 3, from original 3 and 5)
- Introduces new letters C and D
- Contains no A or S
</think>

Based on the feedback that R is correct in position 2, and O and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I'll try a word that moves O and E to new positions while introducing new letters.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- R is locked in position 2.
- O and E must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (CREDO) we learned:
- C and D are not in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it moved from 5 → 3 and is still “-”).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it moved from 3 → 5 and is still “-”).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain both O and E.
- Allowed positions:
  – O: 1, 4   (cannot be 3 or 5)
  – E: 1, 3, 4  (cannot be 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, S, C, D

We have two main placements for O and E:
1) O in 1, E in 3 or 4 → Word shapes:
   O R E _ _   or   O R _ E _
2) O in 4, E must then be in 1 or 3 → Word shapes:
   _ R E _ O   or   E R _ _ O

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters:

Shape O R E _ _  (O1, R2, E3):
  ORENT? → not valid.
  OREXX? → none common.

Shape O R _ E _  (O1, R2, E4):
  ORIEL – contains I and L; letters not yet tested.
  ORFE? – too short.
  ORBED – contains B and D; D already ruled out.

Shape _ R E _ O  (O5 is banned; skip).

Shape E R _ _ O  (E1, R2, O5 is banned; skip).

Shape _ R E O _  (O4, E3):

Shape O R _ _ E  (E5 banned; skip).

Shape E R O _ _  (E1, R2, O3):
  ERODE – but O in 3 is banned (from AROSE feedback).

Re-examining the dictionaries, the only valid common word left that fits all constraints is:

ORIEL – letters O, R, I, E, L
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (locked)
- I and L are fresh letters
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A,S,C,D)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The classic Wordle starting words are things like ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers:
- The vowels A, O, E
- Common consonants R and S
This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- R is in the correct spot (position 2).
- O and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is ? R ? ? ?
- It contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need to place O and E in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback)

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3 or 5)
- E could be in 1, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let's think of words that fit ? R ? ? ? with O and E in valid spots, and no A or S.

Some possibilities:
- BROKE: O in 3 is invalid (from feedback)
- PROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- CRORE: uses O and E but E is in 5 which is invalid
- FRERE: uses E twice but E can't be in 5
- TROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 is invalid

Looking at other combinations:
- We need O in 1 or 4, and E in 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the same position as O).

Let's try:
- ORCLE: O in 1, E missing
- OREXX: needs a real word
- PERON: but P is position 1, E in 3, R in 2, O in 4, N in 5 → PERON? But does it have the letters?
Wait, we need R in 2, and contain O and E.

Valid word: PRONE
- P (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
Next: GROIN - has I which we don't know about
DROOL - has double O
TRODE - O in 3 invalid
FRORE - has double R
DROME - O in 3 invalid
CRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is tricky. Let me think differently - maybe E is in 3 and O is in 1 or 4.

Word structure: ? R E ? ? or ? R ? ? E (but E can't be in 5), so ? R E ? ?

Possible letters for other positions (excluding A,S): common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let's try:
- BREED: has double E
- CREEK: has E in 3, but K is possible
- FREED: has E in 3, but D is possible
- GREED: has double E
- TREED: has E in 3, D at end

But we need O somewhere. The word must contain O.

So we need: ? R ? ? ? with O and E somewhere, O not 3, E not 5.

Let me think of words with O in 1 and E in 3,4:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not a word
- O R ? E ? : ORIEL? But has A (invalid), no A
- O R ? ? E : invalid as E can't be 5

O in 4:
- ? R ? O ? 
Need E in 1 or 3:
- E R ? O ? : ERODE? O in 4, E in 1 - but O is supposed to be in word but in wrong position (from AROSE it was in 3, now in 4 - that's allowed)

ERODE:
- E (1), R (2), O (4), D (5), E (3) - has two Es, but original word might have doubles
But we don't know if E is duplicated. 

FROND - has O in 4, R in 2, but is missing E
BRONX - not a word
DRONE - O in 4, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5
CRONE - O in 3 invalid
PRONE - O in 3 invalid
TRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is harder than expected. Let me try E in 3, O in 1:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not valid
- O R E D ? : OREDA? No
- O R E T ? : ORET? No

Another approach: Use common words with R in 2, O and E elsewhere.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with R in 2:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid
- CRORE: O in 3 invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 invalid
- TROPE: O in 3 invalid

Alternative: Maybe the word is ? R ? O E, but E can't be 5
Or ? R E O ?: but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 4 - that's allowed as shift
Word: TREND? No O
CREDO: O in 4, R in 2, E in 3 - but D is extra
CREDO has:
C (1), R (2), E (3), D (4), O (5) - but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 5 - allowed
E was in 5 in AROSE, now in 3 - allowed
But we need to check if all letters are valid (no A or S)

CREDO:
- Letters: C, R, E, D, O - none are A or S
- R is in correct spot (2)
- O was in 3, now in 5 - wrong position (allowed)
- E was in 5, now in 3 - wrong position (allowed)
- C and D are new, which is fine

This seems like a valid next guess that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

But let me reconsider if there are better options. Another candidate is ""TROVE"":
- T (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
""GROPE"" - same issue with O in 3
""CRONE"" - O in 3 invalid

After careful consideration, ""CREDO"" seems to be a valid next guess that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Places O and E in new positions (5 and 3, from original 3 and 5)
- Introduces new letters C and D
- Contains no A or SBased on the feedback that R is correct in position 2, and O and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I'll try a word that moves O and E to new positions while introducing new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me eliminate or confirm as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The classic Wordle starting words are things like ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers:
- The vowels A, O, E
- Common consonants R and S
This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- R is in the correct spot (position 2).
- O and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is ? R ? ? ?
- It contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need to place O and E in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback)

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3 or 5)
- E could be in 1, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let's think of words that fit ? R ? ? ? with O and E in valid spots, and no A or S.

Some possibilities:
- BROKE: O in 3 is invalid (from feedback)
- PROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- CRORE: uses O and E but E is in 5 which is invalid
- FRERE: uses E twice but E can't be in 5
- TROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 is invalid

Looking at other combinations:
- We need O in 1 or 4, and E in 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the same position as O).

Let's try:
- ORCLE: O in 1, E missing
- OREXX: needs a real word
- PERON: but P is position 1, E in 3, R in 2, O in 4, N in 5 → PERON? But does it have the letters?
Wait, we need R in 2, and contain O and E.

Valid word: PRONE
- P (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
Next: GROIN - has I which we don't know about
DROOL - has double O
TRODE - O in 3 invalid
FRORE - has double R
DROME - O in 3 invalid
CRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is tricky. Let me think differently - maybe E is in 3 and O is in 1 or 4.

Word structure: ? R E ? ? or ? R ? ? E (but E can't be in 5), so ? R E ? ?

Possible letters for other positions (excluding A,S): common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let's try:
- BREED: has double E
- CREEK: has E in 3, but K is possible
- FREED: has E in 3, but D is possible
- GREED: has double E
- TREED: has E in 3, D at end

But we need O somewhere. The word must contain O.

So we need: ? R ? ? ? with O and E somewhere, O not 3, E not 5.

Let me think of words with O in 1 and E in 3,4:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not a word
- O R ? E ? : ORIEL? But has A (invalid), no A
- O R ? ? E : invalid as E can't be 5

O in 4:
- ? R ? O ? 
Need E in 1 or 3:
- E R ? O ? : ERODE? O in 4, E in 1 - but O is supposed to be in word but in wrong position (from AROSE it was in 3, now in 4 - that's allowed)

ERODE:
- E (1), R (2), O (4), D (5), E (3) - has two Es, but original word might have doubles
But we don't know if E is duplicated. 

FROND - has O in 4, R in 2, but is missing E
BRONX - not a word
DRONE - O in 4, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5
CRONE - O in 3 invalid
PRONE - O in 3 invalid
TRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is harder than expected. Let me try E in 3, O in 1:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not valid
- O R E D ? : OREDA? No
- O R E T ? : ORET? No

Another approach: Use common words with R in 2, O and E elsewhere.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with R in 2:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid
- CRORE: O in 3 invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 invalid
- TROPE: O in 3 invalid

Alternative: Maybe the word is ? R ? O E, but E can't be 5
Or ? R E O ?: but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 4 - that's allowed as shift
Word: TREND? No O
CREDO: O in 4, R in 2, E in 3 - but D is extra
CREDO has:
C (1), R (2), E (3), D (4), O (5) - but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 5 - allowed
E was in 5 in AROSE, now in 3 - allowed
But we need to check if all letters are valid (no A or S)

CREDO:
- Letters: C, R, E, D, O - none are A or S
- R is in correct spot (2)
- O was in 3, now in 5 - wrong position (allowed)
- E was in 5, now in 3 - wrong position (allowed)
- C and D are new, which is fine

This seems like a valid next guess that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

But let me reconsider if there are better options. Another candidate is ""TROVE"":
- T (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
""GROPE"" - same issue with O in 3
""CRONE"" - O in 3 invalid

After careful consideration, ""CREDO"" seems to be a valid next guess that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Places O and E in new positions (5 and 3, from original 3 and 5)
- Introduces new letters C and D
- Contains no A or SBased on the feedback that R is correct in position 2, and O and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I'll try a word that moves O and E to new positions while introducing new letters.

Guess 2: CREDO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- R is locked in position 2.
- O and E must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (CREDO) we learned:
- C and D are not in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it moved from 5 → 3 and is still “-”).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it moved from 3 → 5 and is still “-”).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain both O and E.
- Allowed positions:
  – O: 1, 4   (cannot be 3 or 5)
  – E: 1, 3, 4  (cannot be 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, S, C, D

We have two main placements for O and E:
1) O in 1, E in 3 or 4 → Word shapes:
   O R E _ _   or   O R _ E _
2) O in 4, E must then be in 1 or 3 → Word shapes:
   _ R E _ O   or   E R _ _ O

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters:

Shape O R E _ _  (O1, R2, E3):
  ORENT? → not valid.
  OREXX? → none common.

Shape O R _ E _  (O1, R2, E4):
  ORIEL – contains I and L; letters not yet tested.
  ORFE? – too short.
  ORBED – contains B and D; D already ruled out.

Shape _ R E _ O  (O5 is banned; skip).

Shape E R _ _ O  (E1, R2, O5 is banned; skip).

Shape _ R E O _  (O4, E3):
  PREON – not a word.
  TREOK – invalid.
  GREON – invalid.

Shape _ R _ E O  (O5 banned; skip).

Shape _ R _ O E  (E5 banned; skip).

Shape O R _ _ E  (E5 banned; skip).

Shape E R O _ _  (E1, R2, O3):
  ERODE – but O in 3 is banned (from AROSE feedback).

Re-examining the dictionaries, the only valid common word left that fits all constraints is:

ORIEL – letters O, R, I, E, L
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (locked)
- I and L are fresh letters
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A,S,C,D)

Therefore ORIEL is the best next guess.

1. R is locked in position 2: _ R _ _ _
2. The word must contain both O and E, but every position tried so far has been wrong for each of them:
   - O has been tried at positions 3 → wrong, 5 → wrong, 1 → wrong, 4 → wrong.  
     Hence O has only one untested place: position 3 is impossible because it was already marked wrong in position 3, but notice the feedback:  
        AROSE: O(-) at 3 → O is in the word but not at 3  
        CREDO: O(-) at 5 → O is in the word but not at 5  
        ORIEL: O(-) at 1 → O is in the word but not at 1  
        ERGOT: O(-) at 4 → O is in the word but not at 4  
     That exhausts every slot except position 2, but position 2 is fixed as R.  
     Therefore O **must** be in position 4 (the only remaining legal spot) and still be marked (-) – but that contradicts the feedback.  
     Wait – re-read carefully:  
        In AROSE feedback, O is (-) at position 3 → “in the word, not at 3”.  
        In CREDO feedback, O is (-) at position 5 → “in the word, not at 5”.  
        In ORIEL feedback, O is (-) at position 1 → “in the word, not at 1”.  
        In ERGOT feedback, O is (-) at position 4 → “in the word, not at 4”.  

     That leaves **only position 2**, but position 2 is already R.  
     There is **no remaining slot** for O.  This implies my earlier conclusion was wrong: the feedback must be interpreted as “in the word somewhere” not necessarily “must appear”.  But we have seen four different positions for O and all were marked (-).  That is logically impossible unless O does not appear, which would contradict the first feedback.  This is a paradox.

   The only resolution is that the feedback symbol (-) means “letter is in the word but NOT in this position”, and the symbol (✓) means “correct position”.  Therefore we must have:

   - O must be somewhere; positions 1,3,4,5 have been tried and marked (-) – therefore **O must be in position 2** – but position 2 is already R.  This seems impossible.

   Rechecking the feedback carefully:

   AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  – A and S not in word; R in position 2, O and E **are in the word somewhere** (symbol is ✓, not -).

   ORIEL → O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)  
   ERGOT → E(-) R(✓) G(x) O(-) T(x)  

   Ah!  The AROSE feedback for O and E is **✓** (correct position) for positions 3 and 5 respectively.  My earlier interpretations were incorrect.  Let’s list the actual facts.

   R is fixed in position 2.

   From AROSE:
   - positions 3 and 5 are **correct** for O and E respectively → word is _ R O _ E.

   All subsequent feedback must be interpreted with this in mind.  There is no contradiction; instead, the secret word pattern is _ R O _ E.

   Forbidden letters from all four guesses: A, S, C, D, I, L, G, T.

   Remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, F, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   We need two consonants to fill slots 1 and 4 to make a valid English word of the form ? R O ? E.

   Testing common words:
   - B R O K E – valid (BROKE) but O is already at 3 and E at 5 – matches pattern.  However G was ruled out, but K is still allowed.  But BROKE has O in position 3 and E in 5 – exactly matching AROSE feedback.  We have not tested B or K yet.
   - F R O N E – not valid.
   - P R O N E – valid (PRONE) but N and E are allowed (E is already at 5, N is new).  
   - F R O Z E – Z not yet tested, but is it a word?  FROZE is past of freeze → valid.  But Z is not forbidden.
   - M R O N E – not valid.
   - W R O N E – not valid.

   PRONE uses P and N, neither of which have been tested or ruled out, and fits _ R O _ E perfectly.

   Therefore PRONE is the logical next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me eliminate or confirm as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The classic Wordle starting words are things like ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers:
- The vowels A, O, E
- Common consonants R and S
This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- R is in the correct spot (position 2).
- O and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is ? R ? ? ?
- It contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need to place O and E in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback)

Possible positions:
- O could be in 1, 4 (but not 3 or 5)
- E could be in 1, 3, 4 (but not 5)

Let's think of words that fit ? R ? ? ? with O and E in valid spots, and no A or S.

Some possibilities:
- BROKE: O in 3 is invalid (from feedback)
- PROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- CRORE: uses O and E but E is in 5 which is invalid
- FRERE: uses E twice but E can't be in 5
- TROPE: O in 3 is invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 is invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 is invalid

Looking at other combinations:
- We need O in 1 or 4, and E in 1, 3, or 4 (but not at the same position as O).

Let's try:
- ORCLE: O in 1, E missing
- OREXX: needs a real word
- PERON: but P is position 1, E in 3, R in 2, O in 4, N in 5 → PERON? But does it have the letters?
Wait, we need R in 2, and contain O and E.

Valid word: PRONE
- P (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
Next: GROIN - has I which we don't know about
DROOL - has double O
TRODE - O in 3 invalid
FRORE - has double R
DROME - O in 3 invalid
CRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is tricky. Let me think differently - maybe E is in 3 and O is in 1 or 4.

Word structure: ? R E ? ? or ? R ? ? E (but E can't be in 5), so ? R E ? ?

Possible letters for other positions (excluding A,S): common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let's try:
- BREED: has double E
- CREEK: has E in 3, but K is possible
- FREED: has E in 3, but D is possible
- GREED: has double E
- TREED: has E in 3, D at end

But we need O somewhere. The word must contain O.

So we need: ? R ? ? ? with O and E somewhere, O not 3, E not 5.

Let me think of words with O in 1 and E in 3,4:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not a word
- O R ? E ? : ORIEL? But has A (invalid), no A
- O R ? ? E : invalid as E can't be 5

O in 4:
- ? R ? O ? 
Need E in 1 or 3:
- E R ? O ? : ERODE? O in 4, E in 1 - but O is supposed to be in word but in wrong position (from AROSE it was in 3, now in 4 - that's allowed)

ERODE:
- E (1), R (2), O (4), D (5), E (3) - has two Es, but original word might have doubles
But we don't know if E is duplicated. 

FROND - has O in 4, R in 2, but is missing E
BRONX - not a word
DRONE - O in 4, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5
CRONE - O in 3 invalid
PRONE - O in 3 invalid
TRONE - O in 3 invalid

This is harder than expected. Let me try E in 3, O in 1:
- O R E ? ? : OREST? Not valid
- O R E D ? : OREDA? No
- O R E T ? : ORET? No

Another approach: Use common words with R in 2, O and E elsewhere.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with R in 2:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid
- CRORE: O in 3 invalid
- DROVE: O in 3 invalid
- GROVE: O in 3 invalid
- PROBE: O in 3 invalid
- TROPE: O in 3 invalid

Alternative: Maybe the word is ? R ? O E, but E can't be 5
Or ? R E O ?: but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 4 - that's allowed as shift
Word: TREND? No O
CREDO: O in 4, R in 2, E in 3 - but D is extra
CREDO has:
C (1), R (2), E (3), D (4), O (5) - but O was in 3 in AROSE, now in 5 - allowed
E was in 5 in AROSE, now in 3 - allowed
But we need to check if all letters are valid (no A or S)

CREDO:
- Letters: C, R, E, D, O - none are A or S
- R is in correct spot (2)
- O was in 3, now in 5 - wrong position (allowed)
- E was in 5, now in 3 - wrong position (allowed)
- C and D are new, which is fine

This seems like a valid next guess that tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

But let me reconsider if there are better options. Another candidate is ""TROVE"":
- T (1), R (2), O (3) - but O can't be in 3 (invalid)
""GROPE"" - same issue with O in 3
""CRONE"" - O in 3 invalid

After careful consideration, ""CREDO"" seems to be a valid next guess that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Places O and E in new positions (5 and 3, from original 3 and 5)
- Introduces new letters C and D
- Contains no A or SBased on the feedback that R is correct in position 2, and O and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I'll try a word that moves O and E to new positions while introducing new letters.

<guess>CREDO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CREDO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- R is locked in position 2.
- O and E must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (CREDO) we learned:
- C and D are not in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it moved from 5 → 3 and is still “-”).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it moved from 3 → 5 and is still “-”).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain both O and E.
- Allowed positions:
  – O: 1, 4   (cannot be 3 or 5)
  – E: 1, 3, 4  (cannot be 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, S, C, D

We have two main placements for O and E:
1) O in 1, E in 3 or 4 → Word shapes:
   O R E _ _   or   O R _ E _
2) O in 4, E must then be in 1 or 3 → Word shapes:
   _ R E _ O   or   E R _ _ O

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters:

Shape O R E _ _  (O1, R2, E3):
  ORENT? → not valid.
  OREXX? → none common.

Shape O R _ E _  (O1, R2, E4):
  ORIEL – contains I and L; letters not yet tested.
  ORFE? – too short.
  ORBED – contains B and D; D already ruled out.

Shape _ R E _ O  (O5 is banned; skip).

Shape E R _ _ O  (E1, R2, O5 is banned; skip).

Shape _ R E O _  (O4, E3):
  PREON – not a word.
  TREOK – invalid.
  GREON – invalid.

Shape _ R _ E O  (O5 banned; skip).

Shape _ R _ O E  (E5 banned; skip).

Shape O R _ _ E  (E5 banned; skip).

Shape E R O _ _  (E1, R2, O3):
  ERODE – but O in 3 is banned (from AROSE feedback).

Re-examining the dictionaries, the only valid common word left that fits all constraints is:

ORIEL – letters O, R, I, E, L
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (locked)
- I and L are fresh letters
- E in 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (A,S,C,D)

Therefore ORIEL is the best next guess.

Guess 3: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now know:

1. R is fixed in position 2.
2. The word contains both O and E, but each in a different wrong position from every guess so far.
   - O has been tried in positions 3, 5 and 1 – all rejected, so O must be in 4.
   - E has been tried in positions 5, 3 and 4 – all rejected, so E must be in 1.
3. Forbidden letters: A, S, C, D, I, L.
4. Pattern is therefore: E R _ O _  (with only the third and fifth letters unknown).

We now need two fresh consonants for positions 3 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden set).  Common consonants still available include B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We want a common English word of the form E R ? O ?.  A quick mental scan yields:

- ERGOT  (G and T are still allowed)
- ERGON  (N is allowed, but “ERGON” is uncommon)
- ERBOL  (L is forbidden)
- ERGOT seems the most familiar word that satisfies all constraints.

Checking:  E(1) R(2) G(3) O(4) T(5)
- No forbidden letters.
- Fits the required pattern E R _ O _.  
- G and T are new letters we have not tested yet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>1. R is locked in position 2: _ R _ _ _
2. The word must contain both O and E, but every position tried so far has been wrong for each of them:
   - O has been tried at positions 3 → wrong, 5 → wrong, 1 → wrong, 4 → wrong.  
     Hence O has only one untested place: position 3 is impossible because it was already marked wrong in position 3, but notice the feedback:  
        AROSE: O(-) at 3 → O is in the word but not at 3  
        CREDO: O(-) at 5 → O is in the word but not at 5  
        ORIEL: O(-) at 1 → O is in the word but not at 1  
        ERGOT: O(-) at 4 → O is in the word but not at 4  
     That exhausts every slot except position 2, but position 2 is fixed as R.  
     Therefore O **must** be in position 4 (the only remaining legal spot) and still be marked (-) – but that contradicts the feedback.  
     Wait – re-read carefully:  
        In AROSE feedback, O is (-) at position 3 → “in the word, not at 3”.  
        In CREDO feedback, O is (-) at position 5 → “in the word, not at 5”.  
        In ORIEL feedback, O is (-) at position 1 → “in the word, not at 1”.  
        In ERGOT feedback, O is (-) at position 4 → “in the word, not at 4”.  

     That leaves **only position 2**, but position 2 is already R.  
     There is **no remaining slot** for O.  This implies my earlier conclusion was wrong: the feedback must be interpreted as “in the word somewhere” not necessarily “must appear”.  But we have seen four different positions for O and all were marked (-).  That is logically impossible unless O does not appear, which would contradict the first feedback.  This is a paradox.

   The only resolution is that the feedback symbol (-) means “letter is in the word but NOT in this position”, and the symbol (✓) means “correct position”.  Therefore we must have:

   - O must be somewhere; positions 1,3,4,5 have been tried and marked (-) – therefore **O must be in position 2** – but position 2 is already R.  This seems impossible.

   Rechecking the feedback carefully:

   AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  – A and S not in word; R in position 2, O and E **are in the word somewhere** (symbol is ✓, not -).  
   CREDO → C(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x) O(-)  
   ORIEL → O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)  
   ERGOT → E(-) R(✓) G(x) O(-) T(x)  

   Ah!  The AROSE feedback for O and E is **✓** (correct position) for positions 3 and 5 respectively.  My earlier interpretations were incorrect.  Let’s list the actual facts.

   R is fixed in position 2.

   From AROSE:
   - positions 3 and 5 are **correct** for O and E respectively → word is _ R O _ E.

   All subsequent feedback must be interpreted with this in mind.  There is no contradiction; instead, the secret word pattern is _ R O _ E.

   Forbidden letters from all four guesses: A, S, C, D, I, L, G, T.

   Remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, F, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   We need two consonants to fill slots 1 and 4 to make a valid English word of the form ? R O ? E.

   Testing common words:
   - B R O K E – valid (BROKE) but O is already at 3 and E at 5 – matches pattern.  However G was ruled out, but K is still allowed.  But BROKE has O in position 3 and E in 5 – exactly matching AROSE feedback.  We have not tested B or K yet.
   - F R O N E – not valid.
   - P R O N E – valid (PRONE) but N and E are allowed (E is already at 5, N is new).  
   - F R O Z E – Z not yet tested, but is it a word?  FROZE is past of freeze → valid.  But Z is not forbidden.
   - M R O N E – not valid.
   - W R O N E – not valid.

   PRONE uses P and N, neither of which have been tested or ruled out, and fits _ R O _ E perfectly.

   Therefore PRONE is the logical next guess.

R is locked in position 2.  
The only guess that ever showed ✓ for O was the very first one (AROSE), where O came back ✓ in position 3.  
The only guess that ever showed ✓ for E was the very first one (AROSE), where E came back ✓ in position 5.  
All later feedback simply repeated that R, O, E are in the word and in their correct spots.  
From PRONE we only learn that P and N are **not** in the word.

So the fixed skeleton is:
_ R O _ E

Forbidden letters so far:  
A, S, C, D, I, L, G, T, P, N  

Remaining consonants (for positions 1 and 4):  
B, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter English words of the form ? R O ? E:

B R O K E  → uses B and K (both still allowed)  
F R O Z E  → uses F and Z (Z not forbidden)  
M R O W E  → MROWE is not a valid word  
V R O W E  → not a word  
W R O T E  → W and T, but T is already forbidden  
B R O Z E  → BROZE is not a word  
etc.

The only common word left is **BROKE**, which uses B and K, neither of which has been ruled out.
