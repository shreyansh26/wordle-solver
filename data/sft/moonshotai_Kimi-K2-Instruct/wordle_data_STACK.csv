For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to gather as much information as possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it has:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- A: - → in the word but not in position 2
- I: x → not in the word at all
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word definitely does NOT contain R, I, or E.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, G, M, P, B, F, H, V, W, Y, K.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Must include A and S
- Must NOT include R, I, E
- A cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

A good tactic is to place the known letters in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “STAND”:
- S: moves to position 1 (allowed)
- T: new common consonant
- A: moves to position 3 (allowed)
- N: new common consonant
- D: new common consonant

This satisfies all constraints.

Looking for a pair that forms a plausible ending, I’ll try “STAFF”:
- S T A are locked in.
- F and F are new letters (F is allowed).

Although the two F’s are the same letter, it’s still a valid 5-letter word and tests F in both positions 4 and 5.

But “STAFF” repeats F, which is legal, yet we might learn more by using two different letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,STACK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it has:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word but not in position 2
- I: x → not in the word at all
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- The word definitely does NOT contain R, I, or E.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, G, M, P, B, F, H, V, W, Y, K.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Must include A and S
- Must NOT include R, I, E
- A cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

A good tactic is to place the known letters in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “STAND”:
- S: moves to position 1 (allowed)
- T: new common consonant
- A: moves to position 3 (allowed)
- N: new common consonant
- D: new common consonant

This satisfies all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

Letters in the word (and their positions):

- A is correct in position 3.

- R, I, E, N, D.

Still-unknown positions are 4 and 5.  
We need two more consonants or vowels that haven’t been eliminated.  
Common letters not yet used (and not excluded): C, H, L, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, Y, etc.

A good next guess should confirm or eliminate several of these while keeping S, T, A fixed in positions 1-3.  
Let’s try “STAMP”:
- S T A stay fixed in positions 1-3.
- M and P are fresh, common letters for positions 4 and 5.
