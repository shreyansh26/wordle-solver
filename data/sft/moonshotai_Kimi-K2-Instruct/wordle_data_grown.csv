For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The goal is to cover as many vowels and common consonants as possible. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- STARE
- ADIEU

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three very common consonants (S, L, T)

This combination gives good coverage of the most frequent letters in 5-letter English words, which should provide helpful feedback to narrow down future guesses.

All five letters in “SLATE” were marked as “not in the word” (x), so I must avoid S, L, A, T, and E completely in my next guess.

Next, I want to test another set of high-frequency letters while still covering vowels and common consonants. Remaining very common letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B.

Aiming for a balance of vowels and consonants, one strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses two new vowels (O, U) plus the common consonants R, N, D.
- Avoids the five eliminated letters.

Another possibility is “CHURN”, but it repeats the N/R/D pattern and only adds C, H, U. “BRING” is also plausible, but uses I/G, which are slightly less frequent than O/U in first guesses.

Therefore, “ROUND” gives the best combination of fresh high-frequency letters and vowel coverage.

From the feedback:
- SLATE: all letters x → eliminate S, L, A, T, E
- ROUND: R “in word, wrong pos”, O “in word, wrong pos”, N “in word, wrong pos”, U and D x → eliminate U and D

So we know the secret word contains R, O, N (but not in the positions they appeared in ROUND), and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, D.

We still have plenty of letters to test.  The remaining common letters include I, C, G, H, M, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- includes R, O, N
- avoids S, L, A, T, E, U, D
- tries to place R, O, N in new positions compared to ROUND (R was 1st, O 2nd, N 4th)

A good candidate would be “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y
- R is now 2nd, O 3rd, N 4th – none are in their previous disallowed positions
- Eliminates C and Y and tests the placement of R, O, N

Let me double-check: CRONY has no forbidden letters and repositions R, O, N appropriately.

Alternative quick check: IRONY – but that repeats O, N and R in same positions, so not ideal.

   - N exists, but not in the 4th position.
3. Letters confirmed absent (never appear anywhere):
   - S, L, A, T, E, U, D, C, Y

So the pattern looks like: _ R O _ _  
And the word must contain N somewhere, but not in position 4.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested or ruled out:
B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3.
- Contains N somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Uses only letters not in the eliminated set.

Possible positions for N:
Positions 1 or 5 (since 2,3 are taken by R,O and 4 is excluded for N).

So possible structures:
N R O _ _  (N in 1st)
_ R O _ N  (N in 5th)

Let’s try words fitting these patterns.

Option 1: N R O _ _
- NRO?? – Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with allowed letters.
Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W.
Looking for common combinations:
- NROIM – seems uncommon.
- NROKB – no obvious word.
- NRO?? – nothing obvious comes up.

Option 2: _ R O _ N (N in 5th)
- ? R O ? N
We need a letter for position 1 and 4.
Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of common words:
- B R O ? N – “BRON?” – “BRONZ” is not a word, but “BRONK” or similar don’t seem valid.
- F R O ? N – “FRON?” – no common words.
- P R O ? N – “PRON?” – “PRONE” has E (eliminated), “PRONG” has G:
   - PRONG: P, R, O, N, G
   - Check letters: P, R, O, N, G – none eliminated.
   - Positions: R is 2 (correct), O is 3 (correct), N is 4 (but N cannot be 4th from earlier feedback) – so PRONG is invalid for N in 4.
- G R O ? N – “GRON?” – “GRONK” – not common.
- H R O ? N – “HRON?” – nothing.
- I R O ? N – “IRON?” – “IRONE” (invalid), “IRON?” – no 5-letter words.
- M R O ? N – “MRON?” – nothing.
- K R O ? N – “KRON?” – “KRONE” has E (eliminated).
- V R O ? N – “VRON?” – nothing.
- W R O ? N – “WRON?” – nothing.

Wait, maybe I missed other positions for N. Earlier I thought N can only be 1st or 5th, but actually:
Word structure: _ R O _ _
Positions available for N: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are R,O and 4 was excluded for N in previous guess, but that was only for the 4th position in CRONY, not universally banned in 4th). 

Wait no: in CRONY, N was in 4th position and marked as “-” (in word, wrong position), meaning N is in the word but not in 4th. So N can be 1st, 3rd, or 5th. But 3rd is O, so N must be 1st or 5th.

So back to:
N R O _ _  or _ R O _ N

Looking again:
N R O _ _:
- NRO?? – looking for valid 5-letter words starting NRO:
   - NROFF – not valid.
   - NROTC – acronym, not a word.
   - No common words.

_ R O _ N:
- B R O W N – B, R, O, W, N
   - Check letters: all allowed (B, R, O, W, N – none in eliminated list)
   - Positions: R 2 (✓), O 3 (✓), N 5 (allowed)
   - This looks valid.
- Other possibilities:
   - F R O W N – F is allowed, but W is same as BROWN, no advantage.
   - G R O W N – G is allowed.

BROWN and GROWN both fit:
- Both have R in 2, O in 3, N in 5.
- Both use allowed letters.
Which to choose? B and G are both unused so far. BROWN is more common, let’s go with that.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The goal is to cover as many vowels and common consonants as possible. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- STARE
- ADIEU

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three very common consonants (S, L, T)

This combination gives good coverage of the most frequent letters in 5-letter English words, which should provide helpful feedback to narrow down future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” were marked as “not in the word” (x), so I must avoid S, L, A, T, and E completely in my next guess.

Next, I want to test another set of high-frequency letters while still covering vowels and common consonants. Remaining very common letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B.

Aiming for a balance of vowels and consonants, one strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses two new vowels (O, U) plus the common consonants R, N, D.
- Avoids the five eliminated letters.

Another possibility is “CHURN”, but it repeats the N/R/D pattern and only adds C, H, U. “BRING” is also plausible, but uses I/G, which are slightly less frequent than O/U in first guesses.

Therefore, “ROUND” gives the best combination of fresh high-frequency letters and vowel coverage.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- SLATE: all letters x → eliminate S, L, A, T, E
- ROUND: R “in word, wrong pos”, O “in word, wrong pos”, N “in word, wrong pos”, U and D x → eliminate U and D

So we know the secret word contains R, O, N (but not in the positions they appeared in ROUND), and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, D.

We still have plenty of letters to test.  The remaining common letters include I, C, G, H, M, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- includes R, O, N
- avoids S, L, A, T, E, U, D
- tries to place R, O, N in new positions compared to ROUND (R was 1st, O 2nd, N 4th)

A good candidate would be “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y
- R is now 2nd, O 3rd, N 4th – none are in their previous disallowed positions
- Eliminates C and Y and tests the placement of R, O, N

Let me double-check: CRONY has no forbidden letters and repositions R, O, N appropriately.

Alternative quick check: IRONY – but that repeats O, N and R in same positions, so not ideal.

We need a 5-letter word that ends in “ROWN” and whose first letter is NOT any of the letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, E, U, D, C, Y, B).

Scanning the alphabet, the only common English word that fits is:

“GROWN” – but G is still allowed and the word fits (we’ve never used G).

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The goal is to cover as many vowels and common consonants as possible. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- STARE
- ADIEU

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three very common consonants (S, L, T)

This combination gives good coverage of the most frequent letters in 5-letter English words, which should provide helpful feedback to narrow down future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” were marked as “not in the word” (x), so I must avoid S, L, A, T, and E completely in my next guess.

Next, I want to test another set of high-frequency letters while still covering vowels and common consonants. Remaining very common letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, D, G, B.

Aiming for a balance of vowels and consonants, one strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- Uses two new vowels (O, U) plus the common consonants R, N, D.
- Avoids the five eliminated letters.

Another possibility is “CHURN”, but it repeats the N/R/D pattern and only adds C, H, U. “BRING” is also plausible, but uses I/G, which are slightly less frequent than O/U in first guesses.

Therefore, “ROUND” gives the best combination of fresh high-frequency letters and vowel coverage.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- SLATE: all letters x → eliminate S, L, A, T, E
- ROUND: R “in word, wrong pos”, O “in word, wrong pos”, N “in word, wrong pos”, U and D x → eliminate U and D

So we know the secret word contains R, O, N (but not in the positions they appeared in ROUND), and it definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, D.

We still have plenty of letters to test.  The remaining common letters include I, C, G, H, M, B, F, K, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- includes R, O, N
- avoids S, L, A, T, E, U, D
- tries to place R, O, N in new positions compared to ROUND (R was 1st, O 2nd, N 4th)

A good candidate would be “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y
- R is now 2nd, O 3rd, N 4th – none are in their previous disallowed positions
- Eliminates C and Y and tests the placement of R, O, N

Let me double-check: CRONY has no forbidden letters and repositions R, O, N appropriately.

Alternative quick check: IRONY – but that repeats O, N and R in same positions, so not ideal.

<guess>CRONY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- CRONY → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)

What we now know:
1. Letters confirmed present and in correct positions:
   - R is 2nd letter.
   - O is 3rd letter.
2. Letters confirmed present but wrong position:
   - N exists, but not in the 4th position.
3. Letters confirmed absent (never appear anywhere):
   - S, L, A, T, E, U, D, C, Y

So the pattern looks like: _ R O _ _  
And the word must contain N somewhere, but not in position 4.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested or ruled out:
B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2 and O in position 3.
- Contains N somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Uses only letters not in the eliminated set.

Possible positions for N:
Positions 1 or 5 (since 2,3 are taken by R,O and 4 is excluded for N).

So possible structures:
N R O _ _  (N in 1st)
_ R O _ N  (N in 5th)

Let’s try words fitting these patterns.

Option 1: N R O _ _
- NRO?? – Need to fill positions 4 and 5 with allowed letters.
Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W.
Looking for common combinations:
- NROIM – seems uncommon.
- NROKB – no obvious word.
- NRO?? – nothing obvious comes up.

Option 2: _ R O _ N (N in 5th)
- ? R O ? N
We need a letter for position 1 and 4.
Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of common words:
- B R O ? N – “BRON?” – “BRONZ” is not a word, but “BRONK” or similar don’t seem valid.
- F R O ? N – “FRON?” – no common words.
- P R O ? N – “PRON?” – “PRONE” has E (eliminated), “PRONG” has G:
   - PRONG: P, R, O, N, G
   - Check letters: P, R, O, N, G – none eliminated.
   - Positions: R is 2 (correct), O is 3 (correct), N is 4 (but N cannot be 4th from earlier feedback) – so PRONG is invalid for N in 4.
- G R O ? N – “GRON?” – “GRONK” – not common.
- H R O ? N – “HRON?” – nothing.
- I R O ? N – “IRON?” – “IRONE” (invalid), “IRON?” – no 5-letter words.
- M R O ? N – “MRON?” – nothing.
- K R O ? N – “KRON?” – “KRONE” has E (eliminated).
- V R O ? N – “VRON?” – nothing.
- W R O ? N – “WRON?” – nothing.

Wait, maybe I missed other positions for N. Earlier I thought N can only be 1st or 5th, but actually:
Word structure: _ R O _ _
Positions available for N: 1, 4, 5 (since 2,3 are R,O and 4 was excluded for N in previous guess, but that was only for the 4th position in CRONY, not universally banned in 4th). 

Wait no: in CRONY, N was in 4th position and marked as “-” (in word, wrong position), meaning N is in the word but not in 4th. So N can be 1st, 3rd, or 5th. But 3rd is O, so N must be 1st or 5th.

So back to:
N R O _ _  or _ R O _ N

Looking again:
N R O _ _:
- NRO?? – looking for valid 5-letter words starting NRO:
   - NROFF – not valid.
   - NROTC – acronym, not a word.
   - No common words.

_ R O _ N:
- B R O W N – B, R, O, W, N
   - Check letters: all allowed (B, R, O, W, N – none in eliminated list)
   - Positions: R 2 (✓), O 3 (✓), N 5 (allowed)
   - This looks valid.
- Other possibilities:
   - F R O W N – F is allowed, but W is same as BROWN, no advantage.
   - G R O W N – G is allowed.

BROWN and GROWN both fit:
- Both have R in 2, O in 3, N in 5.
- Both use allowed letters.
Which to choose? B and G are both unused so far. BROWN is more common, let’s go with that.

After five guesses we know the exact pattern: _ R O W N.

Letters confirmed in place:
- 2nd: R
- 3rd: O
- 4th: W
- 5th: N

Letters already eliminated (appeared with “x” or were never used) include: S, L, A, T, E, U, D, C, Y, B, F.

We need a single letter for the 1st position that has not been eliminated.  
The only common English letter left that forms a valid 5-letter word is “G”.
