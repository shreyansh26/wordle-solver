For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word with very common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

Feedback from SLATE:
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
L(✓) – L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
A(x) – A is not in the word.
T(-) – T is in the word but not in the 4th position (so it could be 1st, 3rd, or 5th).
E(x) – E is not in the word.

Known so far:
- Fixed: _L _ _ _
- Contains T somewhere other than 4th.
- Does NOT contain: S, A, E.

I need a new word that:
- Keeps L in position 2.
- Includes T in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Avoids S, A, E.

Possible T positions:
1) T _ L _ _
   e.g. TULIP (but has I and P unknown)
2) _ L T _ _
   e.g. CLTOR? (invalid) or FLUTE (has E which is out)
3) _ L _ _ T
   e.g. CLINT (has N which is okay) or BLOAT (has A out)

Best valid candidates:
- CLINT (C, L, I, N, T) – L is 2nd, T is 5th, uses new letters.
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – L is 4th (invalid, L must be 2nd)
- FLIRT (F, L, I, R, T) – L is 2nd, T is 5th, uses new letters.

I'll go with CLINT as it efficiently tests new letters C, I, N while placing T in the 5th spot.

Possible high-value consonants: B, F, G, R, etc.
Vowel available: O, U (since A, E, I are out)

A strong next word would test several of these new letters while fitting the pattern _ L _ _ T.

Candidate words:

- BLOUT – invalid
- FLOUT – real word (F, L, O, U, T) – fits _ L O U T
- GLOUT – invalid
- BLOUT – invalid
- PLOUT – invalid
- BULOT – invalid
- FLOUT is the only real word left that fits the pattern and tests new letters (F, O, U).
