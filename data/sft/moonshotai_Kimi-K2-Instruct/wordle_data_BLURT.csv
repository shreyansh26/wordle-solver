Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that is likely to give me the most information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good options include words like ""RAISE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many English words, which should give me useful initial feedback.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R was marked “-”, so it’s in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are all marked “x”, so none of those letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

That means we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A, I, S, E at all.
2. Contains the letter R somewhere other than the first position.
3. Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Good consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, Y, etc.  
We also need at least one vowel that isn’t A, I, or E—so the only vowels left are O and U.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and keeps R out of position 1, while also including one of the two allowed vowels. “ROUND” satisfies:
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses O and U as vowels.
- No A, I, S, or E.

- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (which must appear once more, not in pos 1 or 2).

We need a word with:

- R must appear in position 4 or 5
- All other letters must be from the still-allowed set.

   – First R is marked “-”, so it is NOT in position 3.  
   – Second R is marked “✓”, so R is **correct** in position 4.  
   – F and Y are now known absent.

Current picture:
- Position 3: must be U.  
- Position 4: must be R.  
- R must not appear anywhere else (because every other R placement has been rejected).  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, Y.  
- Allowed remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.  
- Allowed remaining vowels: none except U (already used).

We need a word of the form: _ _ U R _ where the remaining two letters are chosen from the allowed set and do not repeat any already-used letters.

Candidate letters for positions 1 and 5:  
Position 1: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Position 5: same pool, but must not repeat whatever is chosen for position 1.

Let’s pick a common pair: “L” for position 1 and “B” for position 5 gives “LUBRB”, which is not a valid word.  
Try “L” and “K” gives “LUBRK” – also invalid.  
Try “C” and “K” gives “CUBRK” – invalid.  
Try “T” and “H” gives “TUBRH” – invalid.  
Try “B” and “T” gives “BUBRT” – invalid.  
Try “M” and “P” gives “MUBRP” – invalid.

We need a real word. Scanning the allowed letters, a valid English word that fits _ _ U R _ is “CURRY”:
- C (allowed)  
- U (position 3, correct)  
- R (position 4, correct)  
- R (second R, but we already know R is fixed once in position 4, so a second R would contradict the earlier feedback unless the word has two Rs, but feedback on FURRY showed only position 4 was marked ✓ for R, implying only one R is in the word).  
Therefore “CURRY” has an extra R that we now know is invalid.

Another valid English word fitting the pattern is “MURKY”:
- M (allowed)  
- U (position 3, correct)  
- R (position 4, correct)  
- K (allowed)  
- Y (forbidden, already marked x) – so “MURKY” is out.

Next possibility: “HURRY” – but Y is forbidden.  
“BURNT” – N and T are allowed, but N is forbidden.

Real word fitting the pattern: “PURGE” – but E is forbidden.  
Actually, scanning again, “CUBER” – but E is forbidden.  
“BUGLE” – E forbidden.  

Wait, we need to stick strictly to the allowed letters. The only real common word I can find that fits _ _ U R _ without using any forbidden letters is **“LURCH”**:
L (allowed)  
U (position 3)  
R (position 4)  
C (allowed)  
H (allowed)  

Let’s verify:
Forbidden so far = A, D, E, F, I, N, O, S, Y.  
L, U, R, C, H are all allowed, and no duplicates of R (only one R in the word).  
LURCH is a valid English word.

So the next guess is LURCH.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BLURT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that is likely to give me the most information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good options include words like ""RAISE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many English words, which should give me useful initial feedback.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R was marked “-”, so it’s in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are all marked “x”, so none of those letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

That means we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A, I, S, E at all.
2. Contains the letter R somewhere other than the first position.
3. Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Good consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, Y, etc.  
We also need at least one vowel that isn’t A, I, or E—so the only vowels left are O and U.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and keeps R out of position 1, while also including one of the two allowed vowels. “ROUND” satisfies:
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses O and U as vowels.
- No A, I, S, or E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (from feedback on RAISE and ROUND).
- U is correct and fixed in position 3.
- A, I, S, E, O, N, D are not in the word at all.
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (which must appear once more, not in pos 1 or 2).

We need a word with:
- _ _ U _ _  (U locked at position 3)
- R must appear in position 4 or 5
- All other letters must be from the still-allowed set.

A simple candidate that fits these rules is “FURRY”:
- F is allowed.
- U is in position 3 (good).
- R is in position 4 (not 1 or 2, good).
- Second R in position 5 is allowed (repeats are possible unless ruled out).
- Y is allowed.

Let’s check:
F – allowed
U – ✓ locked at 3
R – allowed at 4
R – allowed at 5
Y – allowed

So FURRY is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate every constraint after four guesses.

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is present, not in position 1.
   - A, I, S, E absent.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(x) D(x)
   - U is correct in position 3.
   - R is **not** in position 2.
   - O, N, D absent.

3. FURRY → F(x) U(-) R(-) R(✓) Y(x)
   - U is present but **not** in position 2 (already known it’s in 3).
   - R is **not** in position 3, and **is** correct in position 4.
   - F, Y absent.

4. LURCH → L(-) U(-) R(-) C(x) H(x)
   - L is present but **not** in position 1.
   - C, H absent.

Summary so far:
- Pattern: _ _ U R _  (positions 3 and 4 fixed).
- Letters known absent: A, C, D, E, F, H, I, N, O, S, Y
- Letters still allowed (and must appear): L, R (already fixed in 4), U (fixed in 3), plus the remaining consonants B, G, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z and no extra vowels (only U is allowed).

From LURCH we know L is in the word but **not** in position 1; therefore L must be in position 2 or 5.  
The pattern is now:  
- Position 2: must be L (since L cannot be in 1, and we have no other position left if it isn’t here).  
- Therefore the word looks like: _ L U R _

We only need a final consonant for position 5 from the still-allowed set: B, G, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Z.

A valid English word fitting _ L U R _ is “BLURT”:
- B (allowed)  
- L (position 2, allowed)  
- U (position 3, correct)  
- R (position 4, correct)  
- T (allowed)

No forbidden letters are used.

So the next guess is BLURT.

<guess>BLURT</guess>",BLURT,"Let’s consolidate every constraint after four guesses.

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is present, not in position 1.
   - A, I, S, E absent.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(x) D(x)
   - U is correct in position 3.
   - R is **not** in position 2.
   - O, N, D absent.

3. FURRY → F(x) U(-) R(-) R(✓) Y(x)
   - U is present but **not** in position 2 (already known it’s in 3).
   - R is **not** in position 3, and **is** correct in position 4.
   - F, Y absent.

4. LURCH → L(-) U(-) R(-) C(x) H(x)
   - L is present but **not** in position 1.
   - C, H absent.

Summary so far:
- Pattern: _ _ U R _  (positions 3 and 4 fixed).
- Letters known absent: A, C, D, E, F, H, I, N, O, S, Y
- Letters still allowed (and must appear): L, R (already fixed in 4), U (fixed in 3), plus the remaining consonants B, G, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z and no extra vowels (only U is allowed).

From LURCH we know L is in the word but **not** in position 1; therefore L must be in position 2 or 5.  
The pattern is now:  
- Position 2: must be L (since L cannot be in 1, and we have no other position left if it isn’t here).  
- Therefore the word looks like: _ L U R _

We only need a final consonant for position 5 from the still-allowed set: B, G, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Z.

A valid English word fitting _ L U R _ is “BLURT”:
- B (allowed)  
- L (position 2, allowed)  
- U (position 3, correct)  
- R (position 4, correct)  
- T (allowed)

No forbidden letters are used.

So the next guess is BLURT.",Guess 5: BLURT -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) U(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
