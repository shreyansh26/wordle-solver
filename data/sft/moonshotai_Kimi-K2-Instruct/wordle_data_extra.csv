For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses a good variety of common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""STARE"", ""ROAST"", ""AROSE"", etc., I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E are all quite common in 5-letter words
- This gives a good spread across different positions

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains {R, A, E}, but not C or N, and none of these three letters are in their original positions.

I need to re-use R, A, E in different slots while avoiding C and N. I’ll also want to include fresh consonants to test new letters. A common pattern that places these vowels elsewhere is “E A R _ _” or “_ E A R _”, etc.

A word that shifts all three known letters to new positions and tests two new consonants is “BREAD”:
- B and D are fresh letters.
- E moves to position 1 (was 5).
- A moves to position 3 (was 3—same spot, which is disallowed by the feedback).
Oops, A can’t stay in position 3, so “BREAD” is no good.

Next candidate: “WEARY”
- W and Y are fresh.
- E moves to 2 (was 5), A to 3 (was 3) → A still position 3 → still bad.

Next: “REACH”
- H is fresh.
- E moves to 1, A to 2, R to 3 → all new positions, and avoids C and N.

But “REACH” contains C, which we already know isn’t in the word (C(x)) → invalid.

Next: “REACT” also has C → invalid.

So far we know:

Letters definitely in the word:
- E in position 1 (✓)

Letters in the word but in the wrong position:
- A (originally in position 3, then still in position 2 → must be in position 4 or 5)
- R (originally in position 2, then in position 3 → must be in position 4 or 5)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
- C, N, L, Y

So the word looks like:
E _ _ _ _ with A and R somewhere in positions 4 or 5, and possibly one more letter in position 2 or 3.

Possible arrangements:
E _ _ A R
E _ _ R A
E _ A R _
E _ R A _

But A and R must both be in positions 4 or 5 (since they were in positions 2/3 and still marked as wrong position). So only these are possible:
E _ _ A R
E _ _ R A

We need to test positions 2 and 3 with new letters. Let's choose common consonants. I'll try D and V to make ""EVDAR"" but that's not a valid word. Next, ""EDVAR"" - also invalid.

Better approach: pick a valid word that fits the pattern E _ _ A R or E _ _ R A.

Possible valid words:
""EXTRA"" - but we know T isn't tested yet, and X is less common.

""EGRAR"" - invalid.

""EPOAR"" - invalid.

""ELBAR"" - contains L which we know is out.

""ESCAR"" - contains C (out).

""EMBAR"" - contains A twice, but we only know one A exists (from feedback), so possible.

But let's think of simpler common words. I think ""EARTH"" but H isn't tested and we know T isn't tested. However, L and Y are out, so H could be valid.

But let's try ""EARTH"" first even though T and H are untested.

Wait, we know A must be in position 4 or 5. In ""EARTH"", A is position 2 which was already wrong position in EARLY (A was in 2, marked wrong), so A can't be in 2. So ""EARTH"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""EAGER"" - A in position 2 is invalid.

""EVERY"" - Y is out.

""EMBER"" - B and M are new, fits E _ _ R pattern, with A somewhere but we need A in 4 or 5. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need the word to have E in position 1, and A and R in positions 4 and 5 (order unknown), and one more letter in position 2 or 3.

So possible patterns:
E X A R _  - but needs 5th letter, but A and R must be in 4/5
Actually, since A and R must be in 4/5, the word must be E _ _ A R or E _ _ R A.

Valid English words:
""EAGER"" - A in 2 is invalid (was wrong position in EARLY)
""EVERY"" - Y out
""ELDER"" - L out
""ENDER"" - possible, N is out though
""EPOAR"" - invalid
""ESCAR"" - C out

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe ""EPOXY"" - but Y out and doesn't fit A/R.

Let me think differently: the word must have E in position 1, A and R in positions 4 and 5 (order unknown), and the middle two letters are new.

Possible: E _ _ A R or E _ _ R A

Common letters left to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible valid words:
""EXTRA"" - X and T new, A in 4, R in 5 → fits E X T A R
But is ""EXTRA"" valid? Yes.

Let's try ""EXTRA"":
E(1) - ✓
X(2) - new
T(3) - new
A(4) - fits (must be 4 or 5)
