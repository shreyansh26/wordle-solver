Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best approach is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. Words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good starting points. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).  
So the word has an E somewhere other than the last position.

With A, R, O, S gone, I still have vowels I and U and consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Good next-step words should:
1. Avoid A, R, O, S

We now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, N, T  
(they all got an x)

Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions so far:
E and I (both received “-”).

That leaves us with the pool of still-possible letters that have not been tried:
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Y Z

We still need to place both E and I somewhere, and we must avoid positions 5 for E and 4 for I (because those were the positions in the previous guesses).

A good next guess should:
1. Use both confirmed letters (E and I).  
2. Use three new, common, untested consonants.  
3. Put E and I in new positions.

Common untested consonants: L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, G, etc.

Let’s try to form a word that fits:
- Positions 1-5  
- Contains both E and I  
- Avoids the letters already ruled out  
- Uses new letters for the remaining slots

A straightforward candidate is “CHIDE”:
- C, H, D are all new letters.  
- It includes both E and I.  
- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from UNTIE). So CHIDE is invalid.

Next try: “BLIMP” – doesn’t contain E or I.

Next try: “PLIED” – contains both E and I, and new letters P, L, D  
- P L I E D  
- I is in position 3 (new), E is in position 4 (new).  
- All letters are allowed so far.

Use both confirmed letters (E and I).  \n2. Use three new, common, untested consonants.  \n3. Put E and I in new positions.\n\nCommon untested consonants: L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, G, etc.\n\nLet’s try to form a word that fits:\n- Positions 1-5  \n- Contains both E and I  \n- Avoids the letters already ruled out  \n- Uses new letters for the remaining slots\n\nA straightforward candidate is “CHIDE”:\n- C, H, D are all new letters.  \n- It includes both E and I.  \n- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from UNTIE). So CHIDE is invalid.\n\nNext try: “BLIMP” – doesn’t contain E or I.\n\nNext try: “PLIED” – contains both E and I, and new letters P, L, D  \n- P L I E D  \n- I is in position 3 (new), E is in position 4 (new).  \n- All letters are allowed so far.\n\nSo let’s guess PLIED.\n\n<guess>PLIED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(-)\nGuess 3: PLIED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) I(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback:
- P, L, D are NOT in the word (all got x).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3, marked ✓).
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4, marked ✓).

So the word has the pattern:
_ _ I E _

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, P, L, D

Still-unused letters that can appear in positions 1, 2, 5:
B C F G H J K M Q V W X Y Z

We have four unused common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3 and E in position 4
- Uses only still-allowed letters in positions 1, 2, and 5
- Is an actual English word

Testing common consonant pairs:
- B I E _ _  (B is allowed)
- C H I E _  (H not ruled out yet)
- F I E _ _  (F is allowed)
- G I E _ _  (G is allowed)
- M I E _ _  (M is allowed)

Valid English words that fit:
- B I E _ _ : “BIER” is 4 letters, not 5.
- C H I E F : “CHIEF” – uses C, H, F – all allowed.
- F I E N D : “FIEND” – uses F, N (but N was ruled out in UNTIE), so invalid.
- G I E S T : “GIEST” – not a valid word.
- M I E N _ : “MIENS” – but S ruled out.

Only valid remaining word seems to be CHIEF.

Let’s verify:
- C, H, E, I, F – none of these letters have been ruled out except E and I which are confirmed correct.
- Pattern C H I E _ – positions 3 and 4 are correct.
- F is allowed in position 5.

Therefore, CHIEF is the logical next guess.
