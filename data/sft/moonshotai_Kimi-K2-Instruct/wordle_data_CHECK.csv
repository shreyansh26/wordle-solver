For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategically optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The best starting words typically include vowels (especially A and E) and very common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels) 
- T (extremely common consonant)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word. The position of these letters is also favorable - ending with E is common, and starting with S is a strong pattern.

From the feedback:
- S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x) — these four letters are NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) — the letter E is in the word, but it is NOT in the 5th position.

That means:
1. We know the word contains at least one E, but NOT at the end.
2. We must avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
3. We still have 21 other letters to work with.

Good strategy: choose a word that:
- Uses E in a position other than 5.
- Introduces several new common consonants (R, N, C, H, M, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, O, U) to narrow the field quickly.

Candidate words:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – valid, uses E in 4th spot, brings in C, R, O, N
- CHIME – but M is less common than N, R
- PRONE – P is common, also has R, O, N, E

Among these, ""CRONE"" gives new letters C, R, O, N plus the known E, and keeps the E out of the last slot.

Current state of knowledge after two guesses:

1. SLATE → S,L,A,T are NOT in the word; E is in the word but NOT at position 5.
2. CRONE → C is correct at position 1; R,O,N are NOT in the word; E is in the word but NOT at position 4.

So we now know:
- The word starts with C.
- It contains at least one E, and that E must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since we’ve eliminated 4 and 5).
- Letters that are completely out: S, L, A, T, R, O, N.
- Remaining candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t used).

We still need the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters.  
We want a word that:
   - Starts with C.
   - Contains E in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.
   - Uses new common letters that haven’t been eliminated.

Candidate words with C _ _ _ _ that include E in positions 2, 3, or 5 and avoid the eliminated letters:
- C H E E P (but P hasn’t been ruled out, and we don’t know if double-E is allowed)
- C H E S S (S eliminated)
- C H E E K (good, uses K which is still valid)
- C H E E R (R eliminated)
- C H E E K (valid, uses K - the E’s are in positions 2 and 3)
- C H E E P (P is still allowed)

""CHECK"" is a valid 5-letter word that starts with C and has E in position 3 (also another E in 4, but the single E rule doesn’t forbid duplicates). It introduces new letters H, E, K that haven’t been ruled out.

""CHEEK"" is also valid, but let’s pick ""CHECK"" first because it’s a more common word and still fits all constraints.

(Note: Both E’s in ""CHECK"" are in valid positions, and no eliminated letters are used.)
