For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word that combines these common letters with no repeats to test as many letters as possible.

Some good starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 distinct common vowels and consonants, giving me maximum feedback potential.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

Takeaways:
1. The word has an O somewhere except position 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. The letters A, R, S, E are eliminated entirely.
3. Remaining consonants worth testing next: T, N, C, L, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Include O in a new position (not 3).
- Use entirely new letters (none of A, R, S, E).
- Cover common consonants to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates: 
- COUNT (C, O, U, N, T) – positions O in 2nd.
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – positions O in 2nd.
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T) – positions O in 2nd.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

Guess 2: COUNT → C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)  
- C, U, N, T are all ruled out.  
- O is confirmed to be in position 2.

So far we know:
- Position 2 = O.  
- No A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U.  
- Still need 4 more letters from the remaining alphabet (common letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.).

A good third guess should:
1. Keep O in position 2.
2. Use 4 *new* letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common in 5-letter words.

Popular patterns that keep O in the 2nd position and use fresh letters:
- B O _ _ _  (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y…)
- _ O _ _ _  with any of those consonants.

Good candidates:
- BOUND – but we already ruled out U and N.
- FOLLY – L and Y are still possible.
- GODLY – G, D, L, Y are still possible.
- BOGGY – G and Y are allowed, but double G might waste a slot.

Let’s pick a word that tests 4 distinct, common, fresh letters:  
- **FOGHY** – F, G, H, Y are all new and common.  
But H and Y might be less common than others.

Another: **DOING** – D, I, N, G. But N is already ruled out.

Better: **POLYP** – repeats P and Y. Not ideal.

Best among fresh, common letters: **MOULD** – but U, L, D: U ruled out, D still possible. Wait, U is already ruled out.

Next best: **DOGMY** – Not a valid word.

Valid five-letter words with O in position 2 and fresh letters:

- **BOGUS** – U and S ruled out.
- **FOCAL** – C ruled out.
- **HOLLY** – L is possible.
- **MOMMY** – repeats M.

Valid five-letter words with O in position 2 and fresh letters:

- **BOGUS** – U and S ruled out.
- **FOCAL** – C ruled out.
- **HOLLY** – L is possible.
- **MOMMY** – repeats M.

From the three guesses we now know:

- Position 2 is **O** (confirmed twice).  
- Letters **eliminated** so far:  
  A, C, D, E, N, R, S, T, U, Y.  
- Letters that **are in the word** but in **wrong positions**:  
  – I (somewhere, but not position 3)  
  – L (somewhere, but not position 4)  
- The remaining alphabet pool still includes: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has **O** in position 2.  
2. Contains **I** and **L** in any of the allowed positions.  
3. Uses only letters **not yet eliminated**.

Possible valid patterns:  
O is fixed at slot 2.  
I cannot be at slot 3, and L cannot be at slot 4.

Let’s list positions and constraints:

Slot 1: any allowed consonant (B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)  
Slot 2: O (fixed)  
Slot 3: any allowed letter **except I** (since I is not allowed here)  
Slot 4: any allowed letter **except L** (since L is not allowed here)  
Slot 5: any allowed letter.

We need both I and L in the remaining three slots (1, 3, 5) because slots 2 and 4 are either fixed or disallowed for those letters.

Let’s systematically build a word:

Option 1:  
Place **I** in slot 1, **L** in slot 3: I O L _ _  
But slot 3 must be allowed (L is allowed here).  
We need a valid five-letter word matching I O L _ _.  
Possible words: IOLAN (not common), IOLAS (not common/valid), IOLIC (invalid).  
No clear valid English word.

Option 2:  
Place **I** in slot 1, **L** in slot 5: I O _ _ L  
Need a word I O _ _ L:  
IOGAL (invalid), IOTUL (invalid), etc. – none seem valid.

Option 3:  
Place **L** in slot 1, **I** in slot 3: L O I _ _  
Need a word L O I _ _:  
LOINS (valid) – but N is eliminated.  
LOIPE (invalid), LOIRY (invalid).  

Option 4:  
Place **L** in slot 1, **I** in slot 5: L O _ _ I  
Need a word L O _ _ I:  
LOBII (invalid), LOKII (invalid), LOPHI (invalid), LOXBI (invalid).  

Option 5:  
Place **I** in slot 3, **L** in slot 5: _ O I _ L  
Need a word _ O I _ L:  
BOILS (valid) – but S is eliminated.  
FOILS (valid) – but S eliminated.  
GOILS (invalid), HOILS (invalid), JOILS (invalid), KOILS (invalid), MOILS (S eliminated), POILS (invalid), etc.  

No valid word here.

Option 6:  
Place **I** in slot 5, **L** in slot 3: _ O L _ I  
Need a word _ O L _ I:  
BOLTI (invalid), FOLGI (invalid), GOLBI (invalid), HOLMI (valid word: HOLMI – a ridge in the brain, but obscure), JOLTI (invalid), MOLVI (invalid), POLKI (invalid), etc.  

""HOLMI"" is technically valid but quite obscure.

Option 7:  
Place **I** in slot 1, **L** in slot 5: I O _ _ L  
No valid word.

Option 8:  
Place **I** in slot 3, **L** in slot 1: L O _ I _

None valid.

Option 9:  
Place **I** in slot 5, **L** in slot 1: L O _ _ I  
Same as Option 6 – HOLMI is the only candidate.

Thus, **HOLMI** is the only valid English word fitting all constraints.  
Let’s check:  
H – allowed (not eliminated)  
O – in position 2 (correct)  
L – allowed in position 3 (position 4 is disallowed for L, but 3 is fine)  
M – allowed  
I – allowed in position 5 (position 3 is disallowed, but 5 is fine)

So **HOLMI** fits perfectly.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word that combines these common letters with no repeats to test as many letters as possible.

Some good starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 distinct common vowels and consonants, giving me maximum feedback potential.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

Takeaways:
1. The word has an O somewhere except position 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. The letters A, R, S, E are eliminated entirely.
3. Remaining consonants worth testing next: T, N, C, L, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
- Include O in a new position (not 3).
- Use entirely new letters (none of A, R, S, E).
- Cover common consonants to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates: 
- COUNT (C, O, U, N, T) – positions O in 2nd.
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – positions O in 2nd.
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T) – positions O in 2nd.

I'll choose COUNT because it tests C, U, N, T while moving O to position 2.

Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

Guess 2: COUNT → C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)  
- C, U, N, T are all ruled out.  
- O is confirmed to be in position 2.

So far we know:
- Position 2 = O.  
- No A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U.  
- Still need 4 more letters from the remaining alphabet (common letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.).

A good third guess should:
1. Keep O in position 2.
2. Use 4 *new* letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common in 5-letter words.

Popular patterns that keep O in the 2nd position and use fresh letters:
- B O _ _ _  (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y…)
- _ O _ _ _  with any of those consonants.

Good candidates:
- BOUND – but we already ruled out U and N.
- FOLLY – L and Y are still possible.
- GODLY – G, D, L, Y are still possible.
- BOGGY – G and Y are allowed, but double G might waste a slot.

Let’s pick a word that tests 4 distinct, common, fresh letters:  
- **FOGHY** – F, G, H, Y are all new and common.  
But H and Y might be less common than others.

Another: **DOING** – D, I, N, G. But N is already ruled out.

Better: **POLYP** – repeats P and Y. Not ideal.

Best among fresh, common letters: **MOULD** – but U, L, D: U ruled out, D still possible. Wait, U is already ruled out.

Next best: **DOGMY** – Not a valid word.

Valid five-letter words with O in position 2 and fresh letters:

- **BOGUS** – U and S ruled out.
- **FOCAL** – C ruled out.
- **HOLLY** – L is possible.
- **MOMMY** – repeats M.
- **POMMY** – repeats M.

Valid, fresh-letter word: **DOILY**  
Letters: D, O, I, L, Y – none of A, C, E, N, R, S, T, U, etc.

3. Uses only letters **not yet eliminated**.

Possible valid patterns:  
O is fixed at slot 2.  
I cannot be at slot 3, and L cannot be at slot 4.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Position 2 is definitely **O** (four times confirmed).
2. Position 3 is definitely **L** (because L got ✓ in HOLMI).
3. Letters already **ruled out**: A, C, D, E, H, M, N, R, S, T, U, Y.
4. Letters known to be **in the word** but not yet placed:
   - **I** (needs to appear somewhere other than positions 3 and 5).
5. Remaining unused/allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not listed above).

We therefore need a 5-letter word of the form:

_ O L _ _

with the following constraints:
- Slot 2 = O
- Slot 3 = L
- Slot 5 ≠ I (since I already showed “-” there)
- Must contain **I** exactly once, and that I must go in slot 1 or 4.
- No disallowed letters from the eliminated set.

Let’s list possible placements of I:

- I O L _ _  → slot 1 = I.  Then slots 4 and 5 need two more letters (not I).  
  Words of this pattern: IOL**??**  
  Valid English words: IOL**AN** (invalid), IOL**IC** (invalid), IOL**ITE** (6 letters), etc.  None are 5-letter.

- _ O L I _ → slot 4 = I.  Then slots 1 and 5 need two more letters.  
  Pattern: ? O L I ?  
  Valid 5-letter words: BOLIX (invalid), FOLIO (O already used), GOLIX (invalid), JOLIX (invalid), KOLIX (invalid), POLIS (S eliminated), VOLIX (invalid), WOLIX (invalid), XOLIX (invalid), ZOLIX (invalid).  

Another common word with this exact pattern is **FOLIO**, but that repeats the letter O in position 4 (invalid because O is already in position 2 and we have no indication duplicates are allowed).  

The only real possibility left is **BOLIX** (not a valid Scrabble word) or **POLIS** (S already ruled out).  There are no standard English words that fit.

Therefore, we need to backtrack: the only place **I** can legally appear is **slot 1**, and we must find a valid 5-letter word of the form **I O L _ _**.  The only actual English word that matches is **IOLAN**, but that’s a proper noun (not standard).

Wait—we missed a simpler candidate: **IOLAN** isn’t valid.  Let’s double-check the dictionary: no standard 5-letter English words fit **IOL??**.

Hence we must reconsider.  Possibly we misread the feedback.  But the feedback is clear: **L** is in the correct spot (slot 3).  Rechecking the valid 5-letter word list, the only word left with O in slot 2, L in slot 3, and containing I exactly once is **IOLAN** (invalid) — which implies there’s an error in our reasoning.

Actually, the correct word must be **IOLAN**?  No, that’s not valid.

Realizing there’s no standard English 5-letter word fitting _ O L I _ or I O L _ _, we must therefore revisit.  The earlier deduction must be correct: **L** is in slot 3 (✓), O is in slot 2 (✓), and **I** must appear once but **not** in slot 3 or 5.  That leaves slot 1 or 4.

The only valid word in the Scrabble dictionary fitting _ O L I _ is **FOLIO**, but F and O are allowed, L is correct, I is allowed, and the last letter O repeats O (which is allowed if duplicates exist).  However, we have not had confirmation that duplicates exist.

But the feedback from HOLMI shows **I(-)**, which means I is somewhere in the word but **not** in slot 5.  Therefore, the only remaining place for I is **slot 4**.

Thus, the only remaining valid pattern is:

? O L I ?

and the only common 5-letter word that fits is **FOLIO**.

Let’s verify:
F – allowed (never eliminated).  
O – correct in slot 2.  
L – correct in slot 3.  
I – in slot 4 (allowed).  
O – second O in slot 5 is acceptable unless the rules forbid repeats (no such rule stated).  

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

**FOLIO**.
