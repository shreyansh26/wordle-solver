For the first guess in Wordle, a good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and frequent consonants as possible. This helps maximize information gain. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ARISE,"" etc. 

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It covers 5 unique letters, maximizing the chance of hitting at least some letters in the word

This should give good initial feedback about which letters are present and their positions.

- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (✓).

So the complete list of excluded letters so far is:
A, R, O, T, I, N

The word must contain S and E somewhere, and must not contain any of the six excluded letters.

Must-have letters: S, E  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Allowed positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
Allowed positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not in {A,R,O,T,I,N}
- Contains S and E
- Meets the positional constraints above

Common remaining letters among allowed ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, Z plus E.

Let’s list candidate words that fit:
- “SE” must appear, with S not in 1 or 4, E not in 3 or 5.

Possible patterns:
E _ S _ _  (E in 1, S in 3)
_ E S _ _  (E in 2, S in 3)
_ _ S _ E  (E in 5 is forbidden, so discard)
_ _ S E _  (S in 3, E in 4)
_ S _ E _  (S in 2, E in 4)
S cannot be in 4 or 1, so skip.

Likely valid pattern:   _ _ S E _   (S in 3, E in 4)

Letters left to fill positions 1,2,5: must be from {B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z}

Quick scan for real words:

- “PUSES” – invalid (duplicate S, and not common)
- “FUSED” – contains D (allowed), but U is allowed
Check: F U S E D – letters allowed? F,U,S,E,D – all ok, and none of the forbidden letters.

FUSED:
- Letters: F, U, S, E, D – all allowed
- S is in 3 (not 1 or 4) – ok

We now have three pieces of feedback.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S is present but NOT in position 4.
   - E is present but NOT in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - S is not in position 1.
   - E is not in position 3.

3. FUSED → F(x) U(x) S(-) E(-) D(x)
   - F, U, D are not in the word.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - E is not in position 4.

Combine all exclusions:
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, F, U, D  
Forbidden positions:
  - S cannot be in 1, 3, or 4.
  - E cannot be in 3, 4, or 5.

So S can only be in position 2 or 5, and E can only be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E (each exactly once).
- Contains none of the nine forbidden letters.
- S must be in 2 or 5.
- E must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s list remaining allowed letters (common letters still available):
B, C, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, S, E

Now test the possible letter/position combinations:

Case 1: E in 1, S in 2
   Pattern: E S _ _ _
   Need two more letters from allowed set, no repeats.
   Possible words:
   ESCH_ – no common word.
   ESPY_ – need fifth letter; “ESPY” is 4 letters.
   “ESSEX” – contains X (allowed) but double S not allowed (only one S).
   “ESSE” – too short.
   No clean 5-letter word here.

Case 2: E in 1, S in 5
   Pattern: E _ _ _ S
   Fill with three allowed letters.
   Possible word: E B B Y S → “EBBYS” not valid.
   E C H O S – contains O (forbidden).
   E C H E S – contains second E (duplicate).
   E L B O S – O forbidden.
   E M B E S – duplicate E.
   E C H O S – again O.
   E L V E S – duplicate E.
   E L B O S – O.
   “ECHOS” – O forbidden.
   “EBBYS” – invalid.
   “ELBOW” – O forbidden.
   “EMBOS” – invalid.
   “EVENS” – duplicate E & N forbidden.
   Nothing valid.

Case 3: E in 2, S in 5
   Pattern: _ E _ _ S
   Fill with two allowed letters, no repeats.
   Letters to pick from: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   Possible words:
   B E G Y S – “BEGYS” invalid.
   B E L L S – duplicate L.
   B E L V S – “BELVS” invalid.
   C E L L S – duplicate L.
   G E L L S – duplicate L.
   H E L L S – duplicate L.
   L E M M S – “LEMMS” invalid.
   P E L V S – “PELVS” invalid.
   V E G Y S – “VEGYS” invalid.
   W E S L Y – S not in 5.
   M E L V S – “MELVS” invalid.
   “PECKS” – K not on allowed list, and duplicate letters.
   “PEWLS” – invalid.
   “HEXYS” – X not in remaining list but X is allowed (we didn’t explicitly exclude X yet). However, X wasn’t in any guess so it’s allowed.
   But we need common words.

Wait, I missed a simple one:
   W E L S H – contains H (allowed) and W (allowed). Let me check letters:
   W, E, L, S, H – none of the forbidden letters, S in 5, E in 2. Looks good.

“WELSH” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: W, E, L, S, H — all allowed.
- S is in position 5 (not 1,3,4) – ok.
- E is in position 2 (not 3,4,5) – ok.
- No forbidden letters – ok.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “WELSH”.
