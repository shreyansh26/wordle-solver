For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.
- O IS in the word, but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- Has O in some position other than the third.

I should now pick a word that:
- Uses O (since we know it’s in the word).
- Avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- Places the O in a different position to narrow down where it belongs.

A good candidate is “DOUGH”:
- It has O in position 2.
- It avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- It uses other common consonants (D, G, H) to test new letters.

However, “DOUGH” has the same O position (second), so maybe shift O elsewhere. Another option: “MOUND” places O in position 3, but we know O isn’t in position 3 from AROSE feedback. Next option: “FOOTY” places O in positions 2-3 (but repeats O). Instead, “POINT” has O in position 2 and tests new letters (P, I, N, T). But I must avoid R and S, and P, I, N, T haven’t been tested yet.

Actually, “POINT” avoids A,R,S,E and places O in position 2. This seems good.

But let’s check another: “CLOUD” places O in position 3 (invalid), “WOULD” places O in position 2 and tests W, U, L, D. This avoids A,R,S,E and has O in position 2. This seems strong.

I’ll go with WOULD.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D
- The letter O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _

Remaining usable letters (still untested): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.
3. Ideally uses common consonants to maximize information.

Possible candidate words with O in position 2:
- BOAST (invalid, uses A, S, T - some letters already excluded)
- BONEY (invalid, uses E)
- COMBO (invalid, uses B twice, but more importantly O is in position 2 and 4 - but O is already confirmed only once)
- FOCUS (invalid, uses S)
- GONAD (invalid, uses A, D)
- HONEY (invalid, uses E)
- JOKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- MONEY (invalid, uses E)
- POKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- TONIC (invalid, uses C, but let's check letters: T, O, N, I, C - all letters are still allowed)

- T, N, I, C are all untested letters that are not in the excluded list.

Thus, TONIC is the optimal next guess.

From the three guesses so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
2. WOULD → W(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(x)  
3. TONIC → T(x) O(✓) N(x) I(x) C(x)

Key facts:
- The letter O is in the word and is in the 2nd position.  
  Therefore the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

- Letters that have already been ruled out (they appeared with “x”):  
  A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D, T, N, I, C

Remaining letters (still possible):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a real 5-letter English word that:
- Has its 2nd letter = O  
- Uses only the remaining letters above (no repeats of already-excluded letters)

Common words that fit:
- BOGGY (B, G, G, Y – repeats G, and only 4 distinct new letters)  
- FOGGY (F, G, G, Y – same issue)  
- JOKER (invalid – E, R excluded)  
- MOMMY (M repeated)  
- POOCH (P, O, O, C, H – C already out)  
- BOBBY (B repeated)  
- HOPPY (P, Y allowed, but two P’s)  
- KOOKY (O repeated)  
- GOOFY (G, F, Y – only 3 new letters)  

The best choice is one that introduces as many new, still-valid letters as possible without using any excluded letter, while keeping O in position 2.

“BOGGY” is valid, but the doubled G limits the information.  
“FOGGY” same issue.

“GOPHY” isn’t a valid word.  
“MOPPY” uses P twice and adds only three new letters.

“JUMPY” uses U (already excluded).

Among real words, the cleanest is “BOGGY” (B, G, Y).  
Alternatively, “BOBBY” would introduce B and Y but repeats B.

After scanning, another valid word that uses four distinct letters is “BUMPY” – but U is excluded (from WOULD feedback).

So “BOGGY” is actually the best remaining common word that fits the constraints.

But let’s check: B, O, G, G, Y – letters B, G, Y are all still allowed (none in the excluded list).  
This tests B, G, Y.

I’ll go with BOGGY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.
- O IS in the word, but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- Has O in some position other than the third.

I should now pick a word that:
- Uses O (since we know it’s in the word).
- Avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- Places the O in a different position to narrow down where it belongs.

A good candidate is “DOUGH”:
- It has O in position 2.
- It avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- It uses other common consonants (D, G, H) to test new letters.

However, “DOUGH” has the same O position (second), so maybe shift O elsewhere. Another option: “MOUND” places O in position 3, but we know O isn’t in position 3 from AROSE feedback. Next option: “FOOTY” places O in positions 2-3 (but repeats O). Instead, “POINT” has O in position 2 and tests new letters (P, I, N, T). But I must avoid R and S, and P, I, N, T haven’t been tested yet.

Actually, “POINT” avoids A,R,S,E and places O in position 2. This seems good.

But let’s check another: “CLOUD” places O in position 3 (invalid), “WOULD” places O in position 2 and tests W, U, L, D. This avoids A,R,S,E and has O in position 2. This seems strong.

I’ll go with WOULD.

Guess 2: WOULD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D
- The letter O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _

Remaining usable letters (still untested): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.
3. Ideally uses common consonants to maximize information.

Possible candidate words with O in position 2:
- BOAST (invalid, uses A, S, T - some letters already excluded)
- BONEY (invalid, uses E)
- COMBO (invalid, uses B twice, but more importantly O is in position 2 and 4 - but O is already confirmed only once)
- FOCUS (invalid, uses S)
- GONAD (invalid, uses A, D)
- HONEY (invalid, uses E)
- JOKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- MONEY (invalid, uses E)
- POKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- TONIC (invalid, uses C, but let's check letters: T, O, N, I, C - all letters are still allowed)

TONIC uses:
- T: not yet tested
- O: confirmed in position 2
- N: not yet tested
- I: not yet tested
- C: not yet tested

All letters in TONIC are from the allowed set. This seems like a good choice.

Another option: VODKA (invalid, uses D, K, A - some excluded)
Another: BONGO (invalid, uses B, N, G - but B and G are allowed, N is allowed, but O is in position 4 which is already confirmed not in position 3 but could be in 4 - but we have no info yet)

TONIC seems better because it tests 4 new letters (T, N, I, C) while keeping O in position 2.

Let's verify TONIC:
- Position 2 is O ✓
- T, N, I, C are all untested letters that are not in the excluded list.

Thus, TONIC is the optimal next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- Letters A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D are not in the word.

My next guess will be a word with O in position 2 and using untested letters.

- BOBBY (B repeated)  
- HOPPY (P, Y allowed, but two P’s)

- GOOFY (G, F, Y – only 3 new letters)  

The best choice is one that introduces as many new, still-valid letters as possible without using any excluded letter, while keeping O in position 2.

“BOGGY” is valid, but the doubled G limits the information.  
“FOGGY” same issue.

“GOPHY” isn’t a valid word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the secret word at all.
- O IS in the word, but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- Has O in some position other than the third.

I should now pick a word that:
- Uses O (since we know it’s in the word).
- Avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- Places the O in a different position to narrow down where it belongs.

A good candidate is “DOUGH”:
- It has O in position 2.
- It avoids A, R, S, E completely.
- It uses other common consonants (D, G, H) to test new letters.

However, “DOUGH” has the same O position (second), so maybe shift O elsewhere. Another option: “MOUND” places O in position 3, but we know O isn’t in position 3 from AROSE feedback. Next option: “FOOTY” places O in positions 2-3 (but repeats O). Instead, “POINT” has O in position 2 and tests new letters (P, I, N, T). But I must avoid R and S, and P, I, N, T haven’t been tested yet.

Actually, “POINT” avoids A,R,S,E and places O in position 2. This seems good.

But let’s check another: “CLOUD” places O in position 3 (invalid), “WOULD” places O in position 2 and tests W, U, L, D. This avoids A,R,S,E and has O in position 2. This seems strong.

I’ll go with WOULD.

<guess>WOULD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: WOULD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D
- The letter O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _

Remaining usable letters (still untested): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.
3. Ideally uses common consonants to maximize information.

Possible candidate words with O in position 2:
- BOAST (invalid, uses A, S, T - some letters already excluded)
- BONEY (invalid, uses E)
- COMBO (invalid, uses B twice, but more importantly O is in position 2 and 4 - but O is already confirmed only once)
- FOCUS (invalid, uses S)
- GONAD (invalid, uses A, D)
- HONEY (invalid, uses E)
- JOKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- MONEY (invalid, uses E)
- POKER (invalid, uses R, E)
- TONIC (invalid, uses C, but let's check letters: T, O, N, I, C - all letters are still allowed)

TONIC uses:
- T: not yet tested
- O: confirmed in position 2
- N: not yet tested
- I: not yet tested
- C: not yet tested

All letters in TONIC are from the allowed set. This seems like a good choice.

Another option: VODKA (invalid, uses D, K, A - some excluded)
Another: BONGO (invalid, uses B, N, G - but B and G are allowed, N is allowed, but O is in position 4 which is already confirmed not in position 3 but could be in 4 - but we have no info yet)

TONIC seems better because it tests 4 new letters (T, N, I, C) while keeping O in position 2.

Let's verify TONIC:
- Position 2 is O ✓
- T, N, I, C are all untested letters that are not in the excluded list.

Thus, TONIC is the optimal next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- Letters A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D are not in the word.

My next guess will be a word with O in position 2 and using untested letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
2. WOULD → W(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(x)  
3. TONIC → T(x) O(✓) N(x) I(x) C(x)

Key facts:
- The letter O is in the word and is in the 2nd position.  
  Therefore the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

- Letters that have already been ruled out (they appeared with “x”):  
  A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D, T, N, I, C

Remaining letters (still possible):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a real 5-letter English word that:
- Has its 2nd letter = O  
- Uses only the remaining letters above (no repeats of already-excluded letters)

Common words that fit:
- BOGGY (B, G, G, Y – repeats G, and only 4 distinct new letters)  
- FOGGY (F, G, G, Y – same issue)  
- JOKER (invalid – E, R excluded)  
- MOMMY (M repeated)  
- POOCH (P, O, O, C, H – C already out)  
- BOBBY (B repeated)  
- HOPPY (P, Y allowed, but two P’s)  
- KOOKY (O repeated)  
- GOOFY (G, F, Y – only 3 new letters)  

The best choice is one that introduces as many new, still-valid letters as possible without using any excluded letter, while keeping O in position 2.

“BOGGY” is valid, but the doubled G limits the information.  
“FOGGY” same issue.

“GOPHY” isn’t a valid word.  
“MOPPY” uses P twice and adds only three new letters.

“JUMPY” uses U (already excluded).

Among real words, the cleanest is “BOGGY” (B, G, Y).  
Alternatively, “BOBBY” would introduce B and Y but repeats B.

After scanning, another valid word that uses four distinct letters is “BUMPY” – but U is excluded (from WOULD feedback).

So “BOGGY” is actually the best remaining common word that fits the constraints.

But let’s check: B, O, G, G, Y – letters B, G, Y are all still allowed (none in the excluded list).  
This tests B, G, Y.

I’ll go with BOGGY.

Current deductions:

1. Pattern is _ O _ B Y (from position checks: O=2, B=4, Y=5).  
2. Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, W, U, L, D, T, N, I, C, G, Z, M.  
3. Still-unused letters that are allowed: F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X.  
4. Word must be a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? O ? B Y.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is “HOBY” — but that is only four letters.  
The valid 5-letter word is “FOOBY” (colloquial or Scrabble form) or “HOBBY” (but B is already in position 4 so we can’t repeat it).

However, letter B is already known to be in position 4, so we cannot use B again.  
Looking at what remains, the only possible valid word is “JOBBY” (slang), but that repeats B.

Actually, the correct common word is “Hobby” but we are constrained by the fact that B is already in position 4 so it can’t be repeated.

After scanning, we realize we missed a simple word: POBKY is not valid.  
The valid word remaining is “FOOBY,” but it contains a double O which is acceptable.

But “FOOBY” is the only word left, but we have to use letters allowed.  
F, O, O, B, Y – F is allowed, O is allowed in 2nd, B allowed in 4th.  
All letters are allowed.

So the only remaining realistic word is “FOOBY.”
