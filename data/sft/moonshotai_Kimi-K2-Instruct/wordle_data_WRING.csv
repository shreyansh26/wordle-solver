For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A: Very common vowel
- R: Common consonant
- O: Common vowel
- S: Very common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A: Very common vowel
- R: Common consonant
- O: Common vowel
- S: Very common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Vowels left: I, U  
I’ll pick a word with R in 2nd spot, include both remaining vowels, and common consonants.  
“TRIUM” has R in 2nd, uses T, I, U, M. All letters are allowed and it tests several possibilities at once.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-)

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Remaining vowels: none (only I was left and it’s in the word)
Remaining consonants to test: we have used T, M; still untested common ones include N, L, G, H, K, D, C, B, F, P.

I want a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has I in a different position (not 3).
3. Uses other common consonants I haven’t tried yet.

Good candidates: GRIND, BRICK, FRISK, DRINK, PRISM, etc.

""GRIND"" uses G, N, D (all untested) and puts I in position 4. This seems like a good next choice to test several new consonants and keep I in a new position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts (after 3 guesses):

1. Pattern: _ R I N _
   – R is locked in position 2
   – I is locked in position 3
   – N is locked in position 4

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   A, O, S, E, T, U, M, D, G (only exists as yellow elsewhere)

3. Still-unused common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus the remaining vowel set is exhausted (I is already placed).

4. The only remaining slot is the first and the fifth positions.

5. Looking for 5-letter English words that match *RIN* with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible endings:  
   - *RINK (BRINK, CRINK – but CRINK not common)  
   - *RINE (BRINE, CRINE – CRINE obsolete)  
   - *RINY (not common)  
   - *RINT (FRINT – not a word)  
   - *RINF (not a word)  

Among common dictionary words, the only likely candidates are BRINK and BRINE.

- BRINK: B, R, I, N, K – all letters are allowed, none eliminated.
- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E – but E was ruled out in guess 1 (AROSE).

Therefore BRINK is the only viable word left that satisfies all constraints.

After four guesses we now know:

1. Positions locked:
   R is in position 2 (✓ every time)
   I is in position 3 (✓ every time since GRIND)
   N is in position 4 (✓ every time since GRIND)

   So the pattern is: _ R I N _

2. Letters eliminated so far:
   A, O, S, E, T, U, M, D, G, B, K

3. Still-available letters (from the alphabet) to fill the first and fifth positions:
   C, F, H, L, P, V, W, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are common).

4. Possible English 5-letter words matching _RIN_:
   - CRISP – but P at the end was not yet tested
   - FRISK – K is already ruled out
   - PRINC – not a valid word
   - PRINT – T already ruled out
   - CRINE – obsolete or not in common usage
   - CRIMP – M already ruled out
   - CRIBS – S already ruled out
   - CRINK – K already ruled out
   - GRIND – already tried
   - BRINK – already tried

Looking carefully, the only common word left is **CRISP**.

- C has not been used yet.
- R is already in place.
- I is already in place.
- N is already in place.
- S was ruled out in guess 1 (AROSE) – wait, S was marked (x), so it is out. That leaves P.

Rechecking our list:

- PRINC – invalid
- PRISM – S eliminated
- PRIME – E eliminated
- PRICK – C and K: K eliminated
- PRIED – E, D eliminated
- CRIMP – M eliminated
- CRISP – S eliminated
- CRIBS – S eliminated
- TRINE – T eliminated
- DRINK – D, K eliminated
- GRIND – already tried
- BRINE – E eliminated
- BRINK – already tried

Wait, let me re-examine the remaining letters:

We have to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated: C, F, H, L, P, V, W, Y, Z.

- F, R, I, N, ? – FRING or FRINY – not words
- H, R, I, N, ? – HRING – not a word
- L, R, I, N, ? – LRING – not a word
- P, R, I, N, ? – PRING – not a word
- V, R, I, N, ? – VRING – not a word
- W, R, I, N, ? – WRING – WRING is a valid word!

WRING:
- W not used before
- R in position 2 (✓)
- I in position 3 (✓)
- N in position 4 (✓)
- G – was G eliminated? In guess 3, GRIND gave G(-), so G is in the word but not in position 1. That means G must be in position 5.

Thus the only remaining valid word is **WRING**.
