For the first guess in Wordle, it's generally strategic to choose a word with common letters that can reveal a lot of information. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A popular starting word is ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage to test multiple letters at once. Another good option is ""AROSE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it’s widely recognized as a strong opening guess.

From the feedback:  
- E is in the correct position (E(✓) at position 5).  
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word at all (all marked with x).  

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain R, A, I, S.  
I need a new 5-letter word that:  
1. Ends with E.  
2. Uses none of R, A, I, S.  
3. Uses fresh common letters to maximize information.  

Good remaining common letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, H, B, etc.  
A word like ""TUNNE"" or ""OUTER"" would violate rule 2 (TUNNE has N, T, U, E, but ""OUTER"" has R).  
A safe candidate: ""TUNNE"" – uses T, U, N (all new), and ends with E.  
But TUNNE isn't valid. Let's try ""UNTIE"" – but I is forbidden.  
Another option: ""BLEND"" – but doesn't end with E.  
Valid word ending with E, no R/A/I/S: ""TROPE"" – has R, so bad.  
""CLOVE"" – has C, L, O, V, E – no forbidden letters.  
""CLOVE"" looks good.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Position 2 = L (✓ from CLOVE and FLUTE)
2. Position 3 = U (✓ from FLUTE)
3. Position 5 = E (✓ from all guesses so far)
4. Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, C, O, V, F, T

So the word looks like: _ L U _ E

Remaining consonants not yet ruled out: B, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, Y  
Vowels: only E is already fixed at position 5.

Testing new consonants in positions 1 and 4 while keeping L-U-E fixed.

A good candidate: ""GLUED"" – but ends in D, not E. Doesn't fit.  
""BLUE"" is only 4 letters.  
""PLUME"" – but ends in E, has U and L in wrong spots.  
Wait: Pattern is _ L U _ E.

Let's list all valid 5-letter words matching _L_U_E:  
- BLUDE – invalid  
- BLUME – invalid  
- CLUTE – has C and T, both excluded  
- FLUME – has F, excluded  
- FLUTE – already tried  
- GLUME – has G, L, U, M, E  
- PLUME – has P, L, U, M, E  
- SLUDE – invalid  
- SLUSE – has S, excluded  

Valid options: GLUME, PLUME

Both GLUME and PLUME introduce new letters: G/P and M.  
Between them, ""PLUME"" tests P and M, both new.  
""GLUME"" tests G and M.  

I choose ""PLUME"" since P is slightly more common.

But wait: pattern is _ L U _ E.  
PLUME is P-L-U-M-E, so positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5).  
This fits _ L U _ E perfectly.  
Letters used: P, L, U, M, E – none are forbidden except L, U, E are confirmed.  
P and M are new tests.
