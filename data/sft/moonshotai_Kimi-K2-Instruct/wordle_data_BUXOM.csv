For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and gives us maximum information about the letter distribution. 

Good first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- Avoids rare letters (Q, X, Z) early on
- Can help identify 2-3 letters quickly

Some strong starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO. I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are **not** in today’s word.

From the feedback so far:

- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) – all five letters are NOT in the word.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – C, L, D are NOT in the word, but O and U are in the word somewhere (wrong positions).

So any valid word must:
1. Contain both O and U.
2. Not contain S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Remaining common letters to work with:  
Vowels: I, Y (sometimes), and we already know O and U are present.  
Consonants: N, M, P, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

Since we know O and U are somewhere in the word, a good next guess should place those two vowels in new positions while introducing fresh consonants. A balanced word using high-frequency remaining consonants could be:

- POUND – but D is already eliminated.  
- MOUND – D eliminated.  
- HUMPY – uses P, M, Y, H but only one known vowel.  
- MOUTH – uses M, T (but T is eliminated).  
- PIVOT – uses P, V, T (T eliminated), I.  
- UNION – uses N, I, N — but we already know O and U are present. However, it gives us two N’s and an I to test new positions.

Actually, “UNION” would:
- Keep U and O in new slots.
- Introduce N and I, both still possible.
- Check the 2nd and 4th positions for O and U.

But we need five unique letters. Let’s think of another:  
“FOYNU” – not a word.  
“VINOU” – obscure.  
“OPINE” – has E (eliminated).  
“QUOIN” – has Q (rare) and N, I, but Q is unlikely.

A better choice is “MIXUP” but X is rare and P is okay.  
Actually, let’s go with “MOUNT” – uses M, N, T (T is eliminated).

Wait, T is eliminated.  
“FOUNT” – F, O, U, N, T – T eliminated.  
“YOUNG” – Y, O, U, N, G – all new letters except O and U.  
This seems solid: Y, N, G are high-frequency untested letters.

So I’ll choose “YOUNG”.

Current known facts  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, Y, N, G  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): O, U  

We now know every letter except O and U must come from the still-possible pool:  
B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus O and U).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that contains both O and U and only uses the still-allowed letters.  A quick scan gives:

FOUL, JUMBO, PIOUS, VOGUE… but only those that fit 5 letters and use allowed letters.

Looking at positions:
– In CLOUD, O was in position 3 (marked -), so O is not in position 3.  
– In CLOUD, U was in position 4 (marked -), so U is not in position 4.  
– In YOUNG, O was in position 2 (marked -), so O is not in position 2.  
– In YOUNG, U was in position 3 (marked -), so U is not in position 3.

Therefore:
- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- U cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and uses fresh consonants is:

V-I-O-U-S (V, I, O, U, S) but S is eliminated.  
P-I-V-O-T → T eliminated.  
H-U-M-O-R → H, U, M, O, R (R eliminated).  
F-O-R-U-M → R eliminated.  

Actually a clean, common word that fits: “FOUL” is 4 letters. 5-letter word: “FOCUS” uses C (eliminated).  “BONUS” uses N (eliminated).  “PIOUS” uses S (eliminated).

Wait, one that works: P-O-U-F-F?  No.  V-I-O-U-R?  No.  J-U-M-P-O?  No.

Looking again, “FUJI” too short.  “PIOUS” again.  “MOUSY” uses Y (eliminated).  “HUMOR” uses R (eliminated).  

I see a valid word: “PIOUS” is invalid because S is out.  “VIGOU” – not English.  “JUMPY” uses Y (eliminated).

Another choice: “FOYER” has Y, E, R eliminated.  

Consider “MIAOU” – missing M and I are allowed, and O, U are present.  It is a valid English word (variant spelling of “meow”).  It tests O in position 4 and U in position 5 – both positions never tested for those letters before.

Let’s use MIAOU.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Good first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- Avoids rare letters (Q, X, Z) early on
- Can help identify 2-3 letters quickly

Some strong starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO. I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are **not** in today’s word.  
That eliminates a lot of common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R).

Next, I want a fresh set of high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Among the remaining most-common letters early lists usually include:  
- I, O (vowels)  
- N, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y (consonants)

A balanced word with three of those remaining vowels/consonants could be:
- “CLOUD” – covers C, L, O, U, D  
- “AUDIO” – covers A (already eliminated), so skip  
- “PLUMB” – P, L, U, M, B  
Of these, “CLOUD” uses five new, fairly common letters and gives us good coverage.

Let’s go with CLOUD.

<guess>CLOUD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) – all five letters are NOT in the word.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – C, L, D are NOT in the word, but O and U are in the word somewhere (wrong positions).

So any valid word must:
1. Contain both O and U.
2. Not contain S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Remaining common letters to work with:  
Vowels: I, Y (sometimes), and we already know O and U are present.  
Consonants: N, M, P, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

Since we know O and U are somewhere in the word, a good next guess should place those two vowels in new positions while introducing fresh consonants. A balanced word using high-frequency remaining consonants could be:

- POUND – but D is already eliminated.  
- MOUND – D eliminated.  
- HUMPY – uses P, M, Y, H but only one known vowel.  
- MOUTH – uses M, T (but T is eliminated).  
- PIVOT – uses P, V, T (T eliminated), I.  
- UNION – uses N, I, N — but we already know O and U are present. However, it gives us two N’s and an I to test new positions.

Actually, “UNION” would:
- Keep U and O in new slots.
- Introduce N and I, both still possible.
- Check the 2nd and 4th positions for O and U.

But we need five unique letters. Let’s think of another:  
“FOYNU” – not a word.  
“VINOU” – obscure.  
“OPINE” – has E (eliminated).  
“QUOIN” – has Q (rare) and N, I, but Q is unlikely.

A better choice is “MIXUP” but X is rare and P is okay.  
Actually, let’s go with “MOUNT” – uses M, N, T (T is eliminated).

Wait, T is eliminated.  
“FOUNT” – F, O, U, N, T – T eliminated.  
“YOUNG” – Y, O, U, N, G – all new letters except O and U.  
This seems solid: Y, N, G are high-frequency untested letters.

So I’ll choose “YOUNG”.

Let me update the constraints step by step.

Known so far:
1. Eliminated letters (NOT in the word): S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, Y, N, G, I
2. Letters confirmed present:
   - O is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ from MIAOU)
   - U is in the word but not in positions 3,4,5 (from CLOUD and MIAOU)

So the mask at the moment looks like:
? ? ? O ?    (position 4 is definitely O)
and U must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

The set of usable letters is now:
U (needed), O (already in place), plus the still-allowed consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (M was marked “-” in position 1, so M is allowed elsewhere).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in position 4,
- contains U exactly once (and not in positions 3,4,5),
- uses only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
U _ _ O _
_ U _ O _
_ _ U O _

Let me search for dictionary words fitting these patterns.

Pattern U _ _ O _:  
“U” followed by any three allowed letters followed by “O”.
For example: U P B O W → not a word, or U M B O … → UMBOS? no.

Pattern _ U _ O _:  
F U _ O _ → F U _ O _ – valid word is “FUBOR”? not a word.
H U _ O _ → “HUMOR” – but R and M are allowed, but R is eliminated.  
V U _ O _ → nothing common.

Pattern _ _ U O _:  
B U _ O _ → “BUFO” too short.  
P U _ O _ → “PURO” no.  
K U _ O _ → “KUDO” + a fifth letter – “KUDOS” (S eliminated).  
M U _ O _ → “MU…” – “MURON” – N eliminated.  

Another pattern: _ _ _ O U is invalid because U cannot be in position 5.

So only one pattern left: _ U _ O _ with letters that are allowed.
A valid English word: “JUMBO” – we have J, U, M, B, O.  
Check constraints:
- J, M, B have not been eliminated.
- O is in position 4 – matches.
- U is in position 2 – allowed.
- All letters used are still allowed.
- Word is 5 letters and valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is JUMBO.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and gives us maximum information about the letter distribution. 

Good first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- Avoids rare letters (Q, X, Z) early on
- Can help identify 2-3 letters quickly

Some strong starting words are: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO. I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are **not** in today’s word.  
That eliminates a lot of common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R).

Next, I want a fresh set of high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Among the remaining most-common letters early lists usually include:  
- I, O (vowels)  
- N, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y (consonants)

A balanced word with three of those remaining vowels/consonants could be:
- “CLOUD” – covers C, L, O, U, D  
- “AUDIO” – covers A (already eliminated), so skip  
- “PLUMB” – P, L, U, M, B  
Of these, “CLOUD” uses five new, fairly common letters and gives us good coverage.

Let’s go with CLOUD.

<guess>CLOUD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) – all five letters are NOT in the word.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – C, L, D are NOT in the word, but O and U are in the word somewhere (wrong positions).

So any valid word must:
1. Contain both O and U.
2. Not contain S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D.

Remaining common letters to work with:  
Vowels: I, Y (sometimes), and we already know O and U are present.  
Consonants: N, M, P, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

Since we know O and U are somewhere in the word, a good next guess should place those two vowels in new positions while introducing fresh consonants. A balanced word using high-frequency remaining consonants could be:

- POUND – but D is already eliminated.  
- MOUND – D eliminated.  
- HUMPY – uses P, M, Y, H but only one known vowel.  
- MOUTH – uses M, T (but T is eliminated).  
- PIVOT – uses P, V, T (T eliminated), I.  
- UNION – uses N, I, N — but we already know O and U are present. However, it gives us two N’s and an I to test new positions.

Actually, “UNION” would:
- Keep U and O in new slots.
- Introduce N and I, both still possible.
- Check the 2nd and 4th positions for O and U.

But we need five unique letters. Let’s think of another:  
“FOYNU” – not a word.  
“VINOU” – obscure.  
“OPINE” – has E (eliminated).  
“QUOIN” – has Q (rare) and N, I, but Q is unlikely.

A better choice is “MIXUP” but X is rare and P is okay.  
Actually, let’s go with “MOUNT” – uses M, N, T (T is eliminated).

Wait, T is eliminated.  
“FOUNT” – F, O, U, N, T – T eliminated.  
“YOUNG” – Y, O, U, N, G – all new letters except O and U.  
This seems solid: Y, N, G are high-frequency untested letters.

So I’ll choose “YOUNG”.

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, Y, N, G  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): O, U  

We now know every letter except O and U must come from the still-possible pool:  
B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus O and U).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that contains both O and U and only uses the still-allowed letters.  A quick scan gives:

FOUL, JUMBO, PIOUS, VOGUE… but only those that fit 5 letters and use allowed letters.

Looking at positions:
– In CLOUD, O was in position 3 (marked -), so O is not in position 3.  
– In CLOUD, U was in position 4 (marked -), so U is not in position 4.  
– In YOUNG, O was in position 2 (marked -), so O is not in position 2.  
– In YOUNG, U was in position 3 (marked -), so U is not in position 3.

Therefore:
- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- U cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints and uses fresh consonants is:

V-I-O-U-S (V, I, O, U, S) but S is eliminated.  
P-I-V-O-T → T eliminated.  
H-U-M-O-R → H, U, M, O, R (R eliminated).  
F-O-R-U-M → R eliminated.  

Actually a clean, common word that fits: “FOUL” is 4 letters. 5-letter word: “FOCUS” uses C (eliminated).  “BONUS” uses N (eliminated).  “PIOUS” uses S (eliminated).

Wait, one that works: P-O-U-F-F?  No.  V-I-O-U-R?  No.  J-U-M-P-O?  No.

Looking again, “FUJI” too short.  “PIOUS” again.  “MOUSY” uses Y (eliminated).  “HUMOR” uses R (eliminated).  

I see a valid word: “PIOUS” is invalid because S is out.  “VIGOU” – not English.  “JUMPY” uses Y (eliminated).

Another choice: “FOYER” has Y, E, R eliminated.  

Consider “MIAOU” – missing M and I are allowed, and O, U are present.  It is a valid English word (variant spelling of “meow”).  It tests O in position 4 and U in position 5 – both positions never tested for those letters before.

Let’s use MIAOU.

No.  V-I-O-U-R?  No.  J-U-M-P-O?  No.\n\nLooking again, “FUJI” too short.  “PIOUS” again.  “MOUSY” uses Y (eliminated).  “HUMOR” uses R (eliminated).  \n\nI see a valid word: “PIOUS” is invalid because S is out.  “VIGOU” – not English.  “JUMPY” uses Y (eliminated).\n\nAnother choice: “FOYER” has Y, E, R eliminated.  \n\nConsider “MIAOU” – missing M and I are allowed, and O, U are present.

Let me consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters completely eliminated (never appear):  
   S, T, A, R, E, C, L, D, Y, N, G, I, J

2. Positions fixed so far:  
   - Position 4 is definitely O (✓ from MIAOU).  
   - Position 2 is definitely U (✓ from JUMBO).

3. Letters that are still allowed (not yet eliminated):  
   B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

4. From JUMBO:  
   - M appeared at position 3 (marked “-”) → M is in the word, but not at position 3.  
   - B appeared at position 4 (marked “-”) → B is in the word, but not at position 4.  
   - O at position 5 (marked “-”) → O is in the word, but not at position 5 (we already knew O is at position 4).

So the current mask is: ? U ? O ?  
with the constraints:
- U is at position 2.  
- O is at position 4.  
- M and B are in the word somewhere (but M ≠ 3, B ≠ 4).  
- The remaining letters must come from the allowed set: B, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible positions for M and B:
- M can be at 1 or 5 (since not at 3).  
- B can be at 1, 3, or 5 (since not at 4).

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words fitting the pattern _ U _ O _ with M and/or B in the remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- B U M O _ → BUMON (not a word)  
- B U _ O M → BUMOM (invalid)  
- M U B O _ → MUBOS (S eliminated)  
- M U _ O B → MUSOB (S eliminated)  
- F U M O B → FUMOB (not a word)  
- B U _ O M → BUXOM (X and M are allowed, B, U, X, O, M – all allowed)  

“BUXOM” is a valid 5-letter English word fitting the constraints:
- B, U, X, O, M – none are eliminated.  
- U at position 2 (matches JUMBO ✓).  
- O at position 4 (matches MIAOU ✓).  
- B appears at position 1 (allowed).  
- M appears at position 5 (allowed).  
- X at position 3 (allowed).

Therefore, the correct next guess is “BUXOM”.
