For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly help narrow down possibilities. The most common consonants in English words are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess should include a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T), providing good coverage for the first guess.

Feedback recap for SLATE:  
- S(-)  – S is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word  
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word  

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E  
- Letters definitely in the word: S, A  
- S must be in positions 2-5  
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  

We want a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in slot 1) and A (not in slot 3)  
- Excludes L, T, E  
- Uses only remaining common consonants and vowels (e.g., R, N, D, I, O, etc.)

A strong second guess that satisfies these constraints and introduces fresh common letters is “RAINS”.

Check:
- R, I, N are all new letters and high-frequency.  
- S is not in position 1, A is not in position 3.  
- No L, T, or E.

Therefore, RAINS is a good next probe.

Let’s consolidate all information we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word (but not in the locations we’ve already tried):
- S  (not in positions 1,2,3,4,5 from RAINS; not in position 1 from SLATE)
- A  (not in position 3 from SLATE; not in position 2 from RAINS)
- R  (not in position 1 from RAINS)
- N  (not in position 4 from RAINS)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, T, E, I

So the word must contain the letters S, A, R, N and one more letter that is neither L, T, E, I.

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 1,2,3,4,5 → this is impossible!  
That means our interpretation must be wrong. Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but NOT in slot 1.  
- A is in the word but NOT in slot 3.  
- L, T, E are NOT in the word.

RAINS → R(-) A(-) I(x) N(-) S(-)  
- R is in the word but NOT in slot 1.  
- A is in the word but NOT in slot 2.  
- I is NOT in the word.  
- N is in the word but NOT in slot 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in slot 5.

So compiling:

Letters in the word: S, A, R, N  
Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, I  
That gives us exactly four distinct required letters. We need one more letter (since the word is 5 letters long) that has never been guessed, and it must be different from the forbidden set {L,T,E,I}.

Possible extra letters that never appeared yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now we know:
- S must be in positions 2,3,4,5 (cannot be 1 or 5? No, wait: SLATE said S not in 1, RAINS said S not in 5. So S must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

- A must not be in 3 (SLATE) and not in 2 (RAINS), so A must be in 1,4, or 5.

- R must not be in 1 (RAINS), so R must be in 2,3,4,5.

- N must not be in 4 (RAINS), so N must be in 1,2,3,5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, A, R, N plus one new letter (say D) and satisfies all positional constraints.

Let’s look for such words systematically:

Try S in position 2:  
_ S _ _ _

A must be in 1,4, or 5. Let’s try A in 1:  
A S _ _ _

We need R and N somewhere. R cannot be 1 (already A), so 3,4,5. N cannot be 4, so N could be 3 or 5.

Option 1: A S N _ _  
We need R and one new letter (D).  
A S N R _ – no 5th letter.  
A S N _ R – let’s try A S N D R – is that a word? Not standard.  
A S N _ D – A S N R D – no.  
This path doesn’t yield a common word.

Option 2: A S _ N _  
Then R must go in 3 or 5.  
A S R N _ – needs a 5th letter, but we already have S,A,R,N, so we need a new letter.  
A S R N D – ASRND – no such word.

Option 3: A S _ _ N  
Then R must go in 3 or 4.  
A S R _ N – A S R _ N – we need a 4th letter, but we already have A,S,R,N. We need a new letter in position 4. The new letter must not be forbidden.  
A S R D N – ASRDN – not a word.

Let’s try A in 4 instead:  
_ _ _ A _

S must be in 2,3, or 4. 4 is A, so S in 2 or 3.

Try S in 2:  
_ S _ A _

We need R and N somewhere. R not 1, so 3,4,5. 4 is A, so R in 3 or 5.  
N cannot be 4, so N in 1,2,3,5. 2 is S, so N in 1,3,5.

Case: R in 3, N in 1 or 5.  
N S R A _ – first letter N, second S, third R, fourth A, fifth needs a new letter.  
We have N,S,R,A plus one new letter. That new letter must be in the 5th spot.  
N S R A D – NSRAD – not a word.

R in 5:  
_ S _ A R  
We need N somewhere. N can be 1 or 3.  
N S _ A R – third letter must be new, so N S D A R – NSDAR – no.  
_ S N A R – first letter must be new consonant, say D: D S N A R – DSNAR – no.

Try S in 3:  
_ _ S A _

We need R and N. R not 1, so 2,3,4,5. 3 is S, 4 is A, so R in 2 or 5.  
N cannot be 4, so N in 1,2,3,5. 3 is S, so N in 1,2,5.

Case: R in 2, N in 1 or 5.

N R S A _ – fifth letter new, say D: N R S A D – NRSAD – no.  
_ R S A N – first letter new, say D: D R S A N – DRSAN – no.

Case: R in 5:  
_ _ S A R  
N must be 1 or 2.  
N _ S A R – second letter new, say D: N D S A R – NDSAR – no.  
_ N S A R – first letter new, say D: D N S A R – DNSAR – no.

Let’s try A in 5:  
_ _ _ _ A

S must be in 2,3, or 4.  
We need R not in 1, and N not in 4.

Try S in 2:  
_ S _ _ A

R must be in 3,4,5. 5 is A, so 3 or 4.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 2 is S, 5 is A, so N in 1 or 3.

Case: R in 3, N in 1:  
N S R _ A – fourth letter new, say D: N S R D A – NSRDA – no.  
R in 4, N in 1 or 3:  
N S _ R A – third letter new, say D: N S D R A – NSDRA – no.  
_ S N R A – first letter new, say D: D S N R A – DSNRA – no.

Try S in 3:  
_ _ S _ A

R must be in 2,3,4,5. 3 is S, 5 is A, so R in 2 or 4.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is S, 5 is A, so N in 1 or 2.

Case: R in 2, N in 1:  
N R S _ A – fourth letter new, say D: N R S D A – NRSDA – no.  
R in 4, N in 1 or 2:  
N _ S R A – second letter new, say D: N D S R A – NDSRA – no.  
_ N S R A – first letter new, say D: D N S R A – DNSRA – no.

Try S in 4:  
_ _ _ S A

R must be in 2,3,4,5. 4 is S, 5 is A, so R in 2 or 3.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 5 is A, so N in 1,2,3.

Case: R in 2, N in 1 or 3:  
N R _ S A – third letter new, say D: N R D S A – NRDSA – no.  
_ R N S A – first letter new, say D: D R N S A – DRNSA – no.  
R in 3:  
_ _ R S A  
N in 1 or 2:  
N _ R S A – second letter new, say D: N D R S A – NDRSA – no.  
_ N R S A – first letter new, say D: D N R S A – DNRS A – no.

We’re not finding common English words in these patterns. Let’s pick a new extra letter that forms a real word. The missing letter is probably O, U, or D. Let’s try O.

We need a word that uses S, A, R, N, O and satisfies the positional constraints.

Candidate word: SONAR  
Check constraints:
- S: must be 2,3,4. In SONAR S is 1 → violates SLATE (S not in 1).  
So SONAR is invalid.

SANRO – not a word.

SNORA – not a word.

ARNOS – not a word.

NASRO – not a word.

Another candidate: SARON – not a word.

Perhaps the extra letter is D, and we missed a word. Try DRANS – no.

Let’s try DANRS – no.

Another candidate: SAND with extra letters – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try a different extra letter: B.

We need S, A, R, N, B.

Candidate: BRANS – word? BRANS is a Scots word for “bran”, but uncommon.

BARNS – word. Let’s check BARNS:

- B: new letter (OK).  
- A: position 2 – RAINS said A cannot be 2. So BARNS is invalid.

BASNR – no.

RABSN – no.

Let’s try C as the extra letter.

Candidate: CRANS – not a word.

CARN S – CARN spelled, but 4 letters.

Let’s try the extra letter H:  
HARNS – no.

Let’s try the extra letter K:  
KARNS – no.

Let’s try the extra letter M:  
MARS N – MARS plus N: MANSR – no.

Wait, let’s look for standard words that contain S, A, R, N plus one new letter. One such word is SNARE.

Check SNARE against constraints:

Letters: S, N, A, R, E.  
But E is forbidden (from SLATE). So SNARE is invalid.

SNARL – L is forbidden.

SNAKY – invalid letters.

Let’s try the extra letter D again and look for a real word that fits.

We need a word with S, A, R, N, D in some order, with:

- S not in 1,5 → must be 2,3,4  
- A not in 2,3 → must be 1,4,5  
- R not in 1 → must be 2,3,4,5  
- N not in 4 → must be 1,2,3,5  

One possibility:  
A in 1, S in 2, R in 3, N in 5 → A S R _ N.  
Fourth letter is new – but we already have S,A,R,N. We need a fifth letter from the remaining alphabet. The word must contain all four plus one new. That means the word must be exactly those five letters, so we need a permutation of A,S,R,N,D.

Let’s list permutations:

D A R N S – DARNS – not a word.

D A N R S – DANRS – no.

R A N D S – RANDS – yes! RANDS is a plural of “rand” (a South African currency) and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints for RANDS:

- Letters: R, A, N, D, S – all OK (no forbidden letters).  
- S: position 5 – but RAINS said S not in 5. So RANDS is invalid.

Another permutation: 

N A R D S – NARDS – no.

S A N D R – SANDR – no.

S A R N D – SARND – no.

D R A N S – DRANS – no.

R A S N D – RASND – no.

R A D N S – RADNS – no.

N A D R S – NADRS – no.

S A R D N – SARDN – no.

D A S N R – DASNR – no.

R A S D N – RASDN – no.

S A D N R – SADNR – no.

So no valid common word using D.

Let’s try the extra letter O again, but we need a valid word.

We need S, A, R, N, O in some order, with positional constraints.

One word: ARSON (crime of setting fire). Let’s check:

A R S O N – letters A,R,S,O,N.  
Constraints:

- S: position 3 – allowed (must be 2,3,4) ✓  
- A: position 1 – allowed (must be 1,4,5) ✓  
- R: position 2 – allowed (must be 2,3,4,5) ✓  
- N: position 5 – allowed (must be 1,2,3,5) ✓  
- O: new letter ✓  
- No forbidden letters ✓

ARSON is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, our next guess is ARSON.
</think>

Based on the constraints derived so far (S, A, R, N must be present, with specific banned positions, and L, T, E, I are not in the word), the only common 5-letter word that fits is:

<guess>ARSON</guess>",ARSON,"Let’s consolidate all information we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word (but not in the locations we’ve already tried):
- S  (not in positions 1,2,3,4,5 from RAINS; not in position 1 from SLATE)
- A  (not in position 3 from SLATE; not in position 2 from RAINS)
- R  (not in position 1 from RAINS)
- N  (not in position 4 from RAINS)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, T, E, I

So the word must contain the letters S, A, R, N and one more letter that is neither L, T, E, I.

Positions ruled out so far:
- S: not 1,2,3,4,5 → this is impossible!  
That means our interpretation must be wrong. Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but NOT in slot 1.  
- A is in the word but NOT in slot 3.  
- L, T, E are NOT in the word.

RAINS → R(-) A(-) I(x) N(-) S(-)  
- R is in the word but NOT in slot 1.  
- A is in the word but NOT in slot 2.  
- I is NOT in the word.  
- N is in the word but NOT in slot 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in slot 5.

So compiling:

Letters in the word: S, A, R, N  
Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, I  
That gives us exactly four distinct required letters. We need one more letter (since the word is 5 letters long) that has never been guessed, and it must be different from the forbidden set {L,T,E,I}.

Possible extra letters that never appeared yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now we know:
- S must be in positions 2,3,4,5 (cannot be 1 or 5? No, wait: SLATE said S not in 1, RAINS said S not in 5. So S must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

- A must not be in 3 (SLATE) and not in 2 (RAINS), so A must be in 1,4, or 5.

- R must not be in 1 (RAINS), so R must be in 2,3,4,5.

- N must not be in 4 (RAINS), so N must be in 1,2,3,5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, A, R, N plus one new letter (say D) and satisfies all positional constraints.

Let’s look for such words systematically:

Try S in position 2:  
_ S _ _ _

A must be in 1,4, or 5. Let’s try A in 1:  
A S _ _ _

We need R and N somewhere. R cannot be 1 (already A), so 3,4,5. N cannot be 4, so N could be 3 or 5.

Option 1: A S N _ _  
We need R and one new letter (D).  
A S N R _ – no 5th letter.  
A S N _ R – let’s try A S N D R – is that a word? Not standard.  
A S N _ D – A S N R D – no.  
This path doesn’t yield a common word.

Option 2: A S _ N _  
Then R must go in 3 or 5.  
A S R N _ – needs a 5th letter, but we already have S,A,R,N, so we need a new letter.  
A S R N D – ASRND – no such word.

Option 3: A S _ _ N  
Then R must go in 3 or 4.  
A S R _ N – A S R _ N – we need a 4th letter, but we already have A,S,R,N. We need a new letter in position 4. The new letter must not be forbidden.  
A S R D N – ASRDN – not a word.

Let’s try A in 4 instead:  
_ _ _ A _

S must be in 2,3, or 4. 4 is A, so S in 2 or 3.

Try S in 2:  
_ S _ A _

We need R and N somewhere. R not 1, so 3,4,5. 4 is A, so R in 3 or 5.  
N cannot be 4, so N in 1,2,3,5. 2 is S, so N in 1,3,5.

Case: R in 3, N in 1 or 5.  
N S R A _ – first letter N, second S, third R, fourth A, fifth needs a new letter.  
We have N,S,R,A plus one new letter. That new letter must be in the 5th spot.  
N S R A D – NSRAD – not a word.

R in 5:  
_ S _ A R  
We need N somewhere. N can be 1 or 3.  
N S _ A R – third letter must be new, so N S D A R – NSDAR – no.  
_ S N A R – first letter must be new consonant, say D: D S N A R – DSNAR – no.

Try S in 3:  
_ _ S A _

We need R and N. R not 1, so 2,3,4,5. 3 is S, 4 is A, so R in 2 or 5.  
N cannot be 4, so N in 1,2,3,5. 3 is S, so N in 1,2,5.

Case: R in 2, N in 1 or 5.

N R S A _ – fifth letter new, say D: N R S A D – NRSAD – no.  
_ R S A N – first letter new, say D: D R S A N – DRSAN – no.

Case: R in 5:  
_ _ S A R  
N must be 1 or 2.  
N _ S A R – second letter new, say D: N D S A R – NDSAR – no.  
_ N S A R – first letter new, say D: D N S A R – DNSAR – no.

Let’s try A in 5:  
_ _ _ _ A

S must be in 2,3, or 4.  
We need R not in 1, and N not in 4.

Try S in 2:  
_ S _ _ A

R must be in 3,4,5. 5 is A, so 3 or 4.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 2 is S, 5 is A, so N in 1 or 3.

Case: R in 3, N in 1:  
N S R _ A – fourth letter new, say D: N S R D A – NSRDA – no.  
R in 4, N in 1 or 3:  
N S _ R A – third letter new, say D: N S D R A – NSDRA – no.  
_ S N R A – first letter new, say D: D S N R A – DSNRA – no.

Try S in 3:  
_ _ S _ A

R must be in 2,3,4,5. 3 is S, 5 is A, so R in 2 or 4.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is S, 5 is A, so N in 1 or 2.

Case: R in 2, N in 1:  
N R S _ A – fourth letter new, say D: N R S D A – NRSDA – no.  
R in 4, N in 1 or 2:  
N _ S R A – second letter new, say D: N D S R A – NDSRA – no.  
_ N S R A – first letter new, say D: D N S R A – DNSRA – no.

Try S in 4:  
_ _ _ S A

R must be in 2,3,4,5. 4 is S, 5 is A, so R in 2 or 3.  
N must be in 1,2,3,5. 5 is A, so N in 1,2,3.

Case: R in 2, N in 1 or 3:  
N R _ S A – third letter new, say D: N R D S A – NRDSA – no.  
_ R N S A – first letter new, say D: D R N S A – DRNSA – no.  
R in 3:  
_ _ R S A  
N in 1 or 2:  
N _ R S A – second letter new, say D: N D R S A – NDRSA – no.  
_ N R S A – first letter new, say D: D N R S A – DNRS A – no.

We’re not finding common English words in these patterns. Let’s pick a new extra letter that forms a real word. The missing letter is probably O, U, or D. Let’s try O.

We need a word that uses S, A, R, N, O and satisfies the positional constraints.

Candidate word: SONAR  
Check constraints:
- S: must be 2,3,4. In SONAR S is 1 → violates SLATE (S not in 1).  
So SONAR is invalid.

SANRO – not a word.

SNORA – not a word.

ARNOS – not a word.

NASRO – not a word.

Another candidate: SARON – not a word.

Perhaps the extra letter is D, and we missed a word. Try DRANS – no.

Let’s try DANRS – no.

Another candidate: SAND with extra letters – but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try a different extra letter: B.

We need S, A, R, N, B.

Candidate: BRANS – word? BRANS is a Scots word for “bran”, but uncommon.

BARNS – word. Let’s check BARNS:

- B: new letter (OK).  
- A: position 2 – RAINS said A cannot be 2. So BARNS is invalid.

BASNR – no.

RABSN – no.

Let’s try C as the extra letter.

Candidate: CRANS – not a word.

CARN S – CARN spelled, but 4 letters.

Let’s try the extra letter H:  
HARNS – no.

Let’s try the extra letter K:  
KARNS – no.

Let’s try the extra letter M:  
MARS N – MARS plus N: MANSR – no.

Wait, let’s look for standard words that contain S, A, R, N plus one new letter. One such word is SNARE.

Check SNARE against constraints:

Letters: S, N, A, R, E.  
But E is forbidden (from SLATE). So SNARE is invalid.

SNARL – L is forbidden.

SNAKY – invalid letters.

Let’s try the extra letter D again and look for a real word that fits.

We need a word with S, A, R, N, D in some order, with:

- S not in 1,5 → must be 2,3,4  
- A not in 2,3 → must be 1,4,5  
- R not in 1 → must be 2,3,4,5  
- N not in 4 → must be 1,2,3,5  

One possibility:  
A in 1, S in 2, R in 3, N in 5 → A S R _ N.  
Fourth letter is new – but we already have S,A,R,N. We need a fifth letter from the remaining alphabet. The word must contain all four plus one new. That means the word must be exactly those five letters, so we need a permutation of A,S,R,N,D.

Let’s list permutations:

D A R N S – DARNS – not a word.

D A N R S – DANRS – no.

R A N D S – RANDS – yes! RANDS is a plural of “rand” (a South African currency) and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints for RANDS:

- Letters: R, A, N, D, S – all OK (no forbidden letters).  
- S: position 5 – but RAINS said S not in 5. So RANDS is invalid.

Another permutation: 

N A R D S – NARDS – no.

S A N D R – SANDR – no.

S A R N D – SARND – no.

D R A N S – DRANS – no.

R A S N D – RASND – no.

R A D N S – RADNS – no.

N A D R S – NADRS – no.

S A R D N – SARDN – no.

D A S N R – DASNR – no.

R A S D N – RASDN – no.

S A D N R – SADNR – no.

So no valid common word using D.

Let’s try the extra letter O again, but we need a valid word.

We need S, A, R, N, O in some order, with positional constraints.

One word: ARSON (crime of setting fire). Let’s check:

A R S O N – letters A,R,S,O,N.  
Constraints:

- S: position 3 – allowed (must be 2,3,4) ✓  
- A: position 1 – allowed (must be 1,4,5) ✓  
- R: position 2 – allowed (must be 2,3,4,5) ✓  
- N: position 5 – allowed (must be 1,2,3,5) ✓  
- O: new letter ✓  
- No forbidden letters ✓

ARSON is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, our next guess is ARSON.Based on the constraints derived so far (S, A, R, N must be present, with specific banned positions, and L, T, E, I are not in the word), the only common 5-letter word that fits is:",Guess 3: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
