This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize the information gained from this single guess. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid rare letters (like Q, X, Z) to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word
3. Be a common word to ensure it's a valid guess

Popular first guesses often include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover many common vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are frequent in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
2. DOES contain S somewhere other than position 5
3. The remaining positions (1-4) still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated

Letters we know are NOT in it: A R O E

- Uses S in a new position (1-4)
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated
- Avoids A R O E

- P is confirmed in position 2 (✓)
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- T is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the current known pattern is:
S P _ _ T
with letters I and L still to be placed somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Letters already eliminated: A R O E N G

Letters already confirmed or located: S P T

Letters still to place: I and L, but each has a position already excluded:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from SPLIT feedback)
- L cannot be in position 3 (from SPLIT feedback)

Thus:
- I must be in position 3 (since it can't be 4)
- L must be in position 4 (since it can't be 3)

So the word must be S P I L T.

Let's verify:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid rare letters (like Q, X, Z) to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word
3. Be a common word to ensure it's a valid guess

Popular first guesses often include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover many common vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are frequent in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
2. DOES contain S somewhere other than position 5
3. The remaining positions (1-4) still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated

Letters we know are NOT in it: A R O E  
Remaining common letters that could appear: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z

We also know S is somewhere in positions 1-4. To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Uses S in a new position (1-4)
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated
- Avoids A R O E

Good candidates:  
- STINK (S in 1st)  
- SLUMP (but L and U are ok, but we haven’t seen them yet)  
- STING (S in 1st, covers new letters)  
- SHUNT (S in 1st, H, U, N, T)  

I'll choose ""STING"" because:
- S is moved to position 1 to test its placement
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G which haven’t been eliminated
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current collected information:

- Letters that were tested and are in the word but not yet placed:
  – T is in the word but not in position 2 (-)

So far we have: S _ _ _ _ (because S is fixed in position 1).
We need to place I and T somewhere in positions 2-5.

We still need three more letters that haven’t been eliminated. Remaining common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out include: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and vowels U, Y (since A, O, E are already ruled out).

A good next word:
- Starts with S
- Places I in either 2, 4, or 5 to test its position
- Includes T to confirm its placement
- Uses new common letters

Candidate words:
- SPLIT: S, P, L, I, T – good coverage, I in 4, T in 5
- SKIRT: but R is ruled out
- SHIRT: H is possible, but R ruled out
- SLIPT: same letters as SPLIT but a rare word
- SPILT: I in 3, but we know I is NOT in 3
- STILT: I in 3 again (ruled out)
- STICK: C is new, but I in 3 is invalid
- SULKY: U, L, K, Y all new, but T must be included

Among the viable options, SPLIT uses:
- S in 1 (confirmed)
- P, L new untested common letters
- I in 4 (valid placement)
- T in 5 (valid placement)

This placement tests I in 4 and T in 5, while introducing P and L.
