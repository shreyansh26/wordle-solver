For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some good options include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE, ROAST. 

I'll go with SLATE because it contains:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about several key letters right away.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.

So we know the word looks like: _ L A _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word with L in position 2 and A in position 3. Good letters to test next would include other common consonants and vowels we haven't eliminated yet (like R, N, M, D, C, etc.).

- PLANT (but T is out)
- BLANK

I'll choose FLANK because:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some good options include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE, ROAST. 

I'll go with SLATE because it contains:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about several key letters right away.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know the word looks like: _ L A _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word with L in position 2 and A in position 3. Good letters to test next would include other common consonants and vowels we haven't eliminated yet (like R, N, M, D, C, etc.).

Looking at possible patterns, _ L A _ _, common words might include:
- CLAMP
- FLANK
- PLANK
- GLAND
- PLANT (but T is out)
- BLANK
- SLANG (but S is out)

I'll choose FLANK because:
- It has L in position 2 and A in position 3 as required.
- It tests F, N, and K which are common letters we haven't ruled out yet.
- It's a valid English word.

- N(✓) → N is in the word and in position 4.
- K(✓) → K is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ L A N K

Letters known to be absent so far: S, T, E, F.

The word must start with a letter we haven’t ruled out yet. Common starting letters that fit _LANK are:
- BLANK (B is still allowed)
- CLANK (C is still allowed)
- PLANK (P is still allowed)
- SLANK (but S is ruled out, so not this one)

Among these, BLANK is the most common English word and hasn’t been tested yet.
