- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

We now know four of the five letters in the exact positions:

- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: S (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: T (✓)

The word pattern is: _ N S E T

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
Letters already ruled out from earlier feedback:  
L, A, O, R, I.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? N S E T that is a valid English word and whose first letter is not one of the excluded ones.

Possible leading consonants that make real words:  
- B → B N S E T → “BNSET” – not a word  
- C → C N S E T – “CNSET” – not a word  
- D → D N S E T – “DNSET” – not a word  
- F → F N S E T – “FNSET” – not a word  
- G → G N S E T – “GNSET” – not a word  
- H → H N S E T – “HNSET” – not a word  
- K → K N S E T – “KNSET” – not a word  
- M → M N S E T – “MNSET” – not a word  
- P → P N S E T – “PNSET” – not a word  
- W → W N S E T – “WNSET” – not a word  

Checking the dictionary, the only common English word ending in N S E T is “INSET”, but we have already eliminated I.  
The next possibility is “UNSET”, but U has not been tested yet.  
“UNSET” is a valid English word (meaning to undo the setting of something).

Therefore, the correct word should be UNSET.
