For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage to maximize information gain. The classic recommendations are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it:
1. Contains 5 of the top 7 most common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. Has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
3. Doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information
4. Uses common letter positions - S often starts words, E often ends them

This should give me good baseline information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked x, so none of them appear in the secret word.  
That leaves 21 unused letters.  
To maximize information, I want a word that uses as many new, common letters as possible.  
The next most frequent letters (ignoring S, L, A, T, E) are:  
R, I, O, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Picking a word that uses several of those high-frequency letters while avoiding any from SLATE gives good coverage.  
A strong candidate is “ROUND”:  
- Letters: R, O, U, N, D (all new)  
- Common vowels O and U  
- Common consonants R, N, D  
- No repeats.

This should quickly narrow down which of the remaining letters are in the word.
