For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, I'll choose ""STARE"" instead because it has similar coverage but might give better information about the placement of common consonants like S and T. This should help me narrow down possibilities effectively.

From the feedback on STARE we know:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has S, T, R somewhere.
- Does NOT have A or E.
- Does not have S in 1st place, T in 2nd, or R in 4th.

We need a new 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints.  
Let’s try to place S, T, R in new positions while avoiding A and E.  
A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T in 1st place (allowed – T is not restricted to 2nd).
- R in 2nd place (allowed – R is only restricted from 4th).
- I (new vowel) in 3rd place.
- P (new consonant) in 4th place.
- S in 5th place (allowed – S is only restricted from 1st).

This tests new positions for T, R, S and introduces I and P.

From both guesses we now know:

Known letters that ARE in the word (just not in the positions tried so far):
- S (not in positions 1 or 5)
- T (not in positions 1 or 2)
- R (not in positions 2 or 4)

Known letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, E, I, P

We need a five-letter word that uses S, T, R plus two new letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A E I P). The remaining vowels are O and U; the remaining common consonants include B C D F G H J K L M N Q V W X Y Z.

Let’s try to place S, T, R in the only three positions not yet ruled out for each:

Valid positions so far:
- S: can be 2, 3, 4
- T: can be 3, 4, 5
- R: can be 1, 3, 5

To avoid overlapping those three letters in one slot, a workable arrangement is:
Position 1: R (allowed)
Position 2: S (allowed)
Position 3: O (new vowel)
Position 4: T (allowed)
Position 5: we still need one more letter; remaining choices among the unused consonants. Let’s pick L (common and unused).

That gives the candidate word “ROSTL”. However, “ROSTL” is not a valid English word. 

Next workable placement:
Position 1: R
Position 2: O
Position 3: S
Position 4: T
Position 5: need another consonant; choose N.

That gives “ROSTN”, which is also invalid.

Try another arrangement:
Positions 1,2: two new consonants; positions 3,4,5 hold R,S,T in some order.
Candidate: C R O S T – invalid.

Instead, pick a known English word that meets the constraints.  
The valid word “SPORT” uses S, P, O, R, T. P was already ruled out in Guess 2, so skip.

Another valid word: “SHORT”
- S, H, O, R, T.
- S: position 1 – already ruled out (feedback said S not in 1st spot) → invalid.

Next: “TORUS”
- T, O, R, U, S.
- T in 1st: allowed (only restricted from 2nd).
- O and U are new vowels.
- R in 3rd: allowed.
- S in 5th: restricted (feedback said S not in 5th) → invalid.

Next: “TORSI” – contains I which is ruled out.

Next valid candidate: “SNORT”
- S (pos 1) – restricted → invalid.

Next: “WORST”
- W (new), O (new), R, S, T.
- Positions:
  1: W (new) – allowed.
  2: O – allowed.
  3: R – allowed (only restricted from 4th).
  4: S – allowed (only restricted from 1st & 5th).
  5: T – allowed (only restricted from 1st & 2nd).

All letters are either already known to be in the word (R, S, T) or are new and not yet ruled out (W, O). “WORST” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be WORST.
