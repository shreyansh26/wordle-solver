For a first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains vowels to test vowel positions
3. Has distinct letters to avoid duplicates initially

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It uses very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback:
- A, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- R and O are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O
- Does NOT contain A, S, E
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3

We need a 5-letter word with R and O, excluding A, S, E. We also know neither R nor O is in their original positions.

Good candidate letters to test next: common consonants like T, N, L, D, I, U, etc.

Let me think of words with R and O but no A/S/E:
- FRUIT - has F, R, U, I, T - but F and I are less common
- TRUNK - has T, R, U, N, K - but K is less common
- ROUND - has R, O, U, N, D - uses common letters, tests new positions for R and O

""ROUND"" seems good because:
- Contains both R and O
- Doesn't contain A, S, E
- R moves from position 2 to position 1
- O moves from position 3 to position 2
- Tests new letters U, N, D

From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is now in the CORRECT position (✓) → position 1
- O is now in the CORRECT position (✓) → position 2  
- U and D are NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → not in position 4

So we know the secret word starts with:
R O _ _ _

It must contain N somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).

Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, U, D

Available common letters left to test: I, T, L, C, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with R O, containing N, and only using letters not yet ruled out.

Possible three-letter endings that fit: NIT, NYM, NCH, etc.

Candidate words:
- RONIN – but has I and duplicates N
- RONNY – uses Y, but Y is less common
- RONCO – uses C, but C is reasonable

Let’s test RONIN:
- R O N I N
- Tests N in position 3, I in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Another option: RONTS – but T is good to test and S is already ruled out.

RONIN seems safer.

Wait, RONIN has two Ns, but we don’t know if the word has duplicates.

RONNE – uses E, which is ruled out.

Better option: RONIC – but C is fine, yet not sure.

Actually, let me think simpler.

We know R O _ _ _ and must contain N.

Possible patterns:
- R O N _ _
- R O _ N _
- R O _ _ N

Let’s try RONIC – but C is okay.

Wait, let me pick a word that puts N in position 3 and tests new letters.

RONIC is okay, but maybe better is RONIN.

But to avoid duplicates, maybe RONNY – but Y is less common.

Actually, RONIN is valid and tests N in position 3 and I in position 4.

Let’s go with RONIN.

Or better: RONIC is not common.

How about RONNE – uses E (ruled out).

Another angle: test N in position 5.

RO _ _ N

Candidate: ROTIN – but T is okay, I is okay.

But ""ROBIN"" is a very common word, uses B (not tested yet), I, N.

ROBIN:
- R O B I N
- B is new, I is new, N in position 5
- No ruled-out letters (A,S,E,U,D are out, none used here)
