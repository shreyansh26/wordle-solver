Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and allows us to gather as much information as possible. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, along with frequently used consonants like R, T, S, N, or L. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the word
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Have good letter positioning potential

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of possible letters.

From the first guess AROSE, we got:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  That means the word contains the letter E, but E is NOT in position 5.

We now know:
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S.
- The word must contain E somewhere in positions 1-4.

A good next guess should:
1. Include E in a new position.
2. Introduce entirely new letters (not A, R, O, S).
3. Use common remaining consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

Let’s try a word that satisfies these: E is moved to position 1, and we use new letters.
One such word is ""UNTIE"", but it has I and U, which are good. However, let’s prioritize more common consonants.

Another option is ""UNTIL"" – but L and N and T are all common, and it moves E out of position 5.

But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but wrong position. Position 5 is wrong, so E must be in 1-4. So let’s try a word like ""UNTIE"" where E is in position 4. Or ""UNTEL"" (but UNTEL isn’t a valid word). 

""ELINT"" is valid (though uncommon). Let’s pick a better common word: ""UNTIE"" uses E in position 4, and all other letters are new (except I and U, which are allowed).

But to maximize information, let’s use a word with as many new letters as possible. ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E – all new except E is known.

A better choice might be ""UNTIE"" or ""ELINT"", but ""UNTIE"" is more common.

But to be simpler and more common: let’s use ""ELINT"" – no, that’s not common. ""UNTIE"" is better.

Another option: ""ELITE"" – but we can’t use R (already forbidden), and we have E in position 1, but we need to test new consonants.

Let me choose ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – all except E are new, and E is in a new position (4).

But to be more common and test more consonants, let’s pick ""ELDIN"" – no, not common.

Actually, let’s use ""UNTIE"" – it’s a valid word and meets all criteria.

But to be safe and more common, let’s use ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – all new except E, which we know is in the word.

But wait, let’s pick a word that has E in a new position and uses common consonants. ""UNTIE"" is fine.

We now have two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but wrong position (not at slot 5).

Round 2 (UNTIE):
- U is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word AND in the correct position (slot 2) (✓).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but still in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:

Letters that are definitely OUT: A, R, O, S, U.

Letters that are definitely IN: E, N (and N is locked at slot 2), T, I.

Positions:

Slot 1: Cannot be U, A, R, O, S.
Slot 2: Must be N.
Slot 3: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}.
Slot 4: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}.
Slot 5: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}, but E is NOT at slot 5 (from AROSE feedback).

So the word structure is:
X N _ _ _
where X is not any of {A, R, O, S, U} and the remaining three letters must be filled with {E, T, I} plus any other letters not yet ruled out.

But since T and I are in the word but in wrong positions (from UNTIE), in the word UNTIE:
- T was in slot 3, but it is wrong there, so T must be in slot 1, 4 or 5.
- I was in slot 4, but it is wrong there, so I must be in slot 1, 3 or 5.
- E was in slot 5, but it is wrong there (from AROSE), so E must be in slot 1, 3 or 4.

Also, we have not yet tested letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of possible words that fit X N _ _ _ with the constraints above.

Possible candidates:
- Since N is fixed at slot 2, and we need to place E, T, I in slots 1,3,4,5 (but not violating their wrong positions), let’s see:

From UNTIE:
- T cannot be in slot 3.
- I cannot be in slot 4.
- E cannot be in slot 5.

Possible arrangements:
- If E is in slot 1, then T and I must be in slots 3 and 4 or 3 and 5 or 4 and 5, but:
  - I cannot be in 4 (from UNTIE), so if I is in 3 or 5.
  - T cannot be in 3, so if T is in 4 or 5.

Let me try to find a word that fits.

One approach is to pick a word with N in slot 2 and try to place E, T, I appropriately, while introducing new consonants to narrow down further.

A good candidate is ""INSET"" – but I is in slot 1, N in 2, S is out (from AROSE), so no.

""ENTER"" – but R is out.

""ENVIE"" – but V is not yet tested, and E is in slot 1 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5).

""ENNIE"" – double N is unlikely.

""ENATE"" – but A is out.

""ENDUE"" – U is out.

""ENEMA"" – A is out.

""ENEMY"" – Y is possible.

Let me think differently: since we have T and I and E to place, and N is fixed at 2, maybe ""INEPT"" – but P is new, but T is at 5, which is allowed (T was wrong at 3, so 5 is ok), but E is at 4, which is allowed (E was wrong at 5, so 4 is ok), I is at 1 (was wrong at 4, so 1 is ok), N at 2, P new. But we haven't tested P yet.

But ""INEPT"" has P, which is new. Let’s see if this is the best.

Another option: ""INTER"" – but R is out.

""INERT"" – R is out.

""INLET"" – L is new, E at 4, T at 5, I at 1, N at 2. This seems possible:
- I at 1 (was at 4, now ok)
- N at 2 (✓)
- L new
- E at 4 (was at 5, now ok)
- T at 5 (was at 3, now ok)

This seems valid and introduces a new consonant L. Let’s check if ""INLET"" fits all constraints:
- No A, R, O, S, U.
- N at 2.
- E somewhere not 5 (here at 4) – ok.
- T somewhere not 3 (here at 5) – ok.
- I somewhere not 4 (here at 1) – ok.

So ""INLET"" is a valid guess.
</think>

<guess>INLET</guess>",INLET,"We now have two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but wrong position (not at slot 5).

Round 2 (UNTIE):
- U is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word AND in the correct position (slot 2) (✓).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but still in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:

Letters that are definitely OUT: A, R, O, S, U.

Letters that are definitely IN: E, N (and N is locked at slot 2), T, I.

Positions:

Slot 1: Cannot be U, A, R, O, S.
Slot 2: Must be N.
Slot 3: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}.
Slot 4: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}.
Slot 5: Must be a letter from {E, T, I, other allowed letters}, but E is NOT at slot 5 (from AROSE feedback).

So the word structure is:
X N _ _ _
where X is not any of {A, R, O, S, U} and the remaining three letters must be filled with {E, T, I} plus any other letters not yet ruled out.

But since T and I are in the word but in wrong positions (from UNTIE), in the word UNTIE:
- T was in slot 3, but it is wrong there, so T must be in slot 1, 4 or 5.
- I was in slot 4, but it is wrong there, so I must be in slot 1, 3 or 5.
- E was in slot 5, but it is wrong there (from AROSE), so E must be in slot 1, 3 or 4.

Also, we have not yet tested letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s think of possible words that fit X N _ _ _ with the constraints above.

Possible candidates:
- Since N is fixed at slot 2, and we need to place E, T, I in slots 1,3,4,5 (but not violating their wrong positions), let’s see:

From UNTIE:
- T cannot be in slot 3.
- I cannot be in slot 4.
- E cannot be in slot 5.

Possible arrangements:
- If E is in slot 1, then T and I must be in slots 3 and 4 or 3 and 5 or 4 and 5, but:
  - I cannot be in 4 (from UNTIE), so if I is in 3 or 5.
  - T cannot be in 3, so if T is in 4 or 5.

Let me try to find a word that fits.

One approach is to pick a word with N in slot 2 and try to place E, T, I appropriately, while introducing new consonants to narrow down further.

A good candidate is ""INSET"" – but I is in slot 1, N in 2, S is out (from AROSE), so no.

""ENTER"" – but R is out.

""ENVIE"" – but V is not yet tested, and E is in slot 1 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5).

""ENNIE"" – double N is unlikely.

""ENATE"" – but A is out.

""ENDUE"" – U is out.

""ENEMA"" – A is out.

""ENEMY"" – Y is possible.

Let me think differently: since we have T and I and E to place, and N is fixed at 2, maybe ""INEPT"" – but P is new, but T is at 5, which is allowed (T was wrong at 3, so 5 is ok), but E is at 4, which is allowed (E was wrong at 5, so 4 is ok), I is at 1 (was wrong at 4, so 1 is ok), N at 2, P new. But we haven't tested P yet.

But ""INEPT"" has P, which is new. Let’s see if this is the best.

Another option: ""INTER"" – but R is out.

""INERT"" – R is out.

""INLET"" – L is new, E at 4, T at 5, I at 1, N at 2. This seems possible:
- I at 1 (was at 4, now ok)
- N at 2 (✓)
- L new
- E at 4 (was at 5, now ok)
- T at 5 (was at 3, now ok)

This seems valid and introduces a new consonant L. Let’s check if ""INLET"" fits all constraints:
- No A, R, O, S, U.
- N at 2.
- E somewhere not 5 (here at 4) – ok.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and allows us to gather as much information as possible. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, along with frequently used consonants like R, T, S, N, or L. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the word
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Have good letter positioning potential

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of possible letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, we got:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  That means the word contains the letter E, but E is NOT in position 5.

We now know:
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S.
- The word must contain E somewhere in positions 1-4.

A good next guess should:
1. Include E in a new position.
2. Introduce entirely new letters (not A, R, O, S).
3. Use common remaining consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

Let’s try a word that satisfies these: E is moved to position 1, and we use new letters.
One such word is ""UNTIE"", but it has I and U, which are good. However, let’s prioritize more common consonants.

Another option is ""UNTIL"" – but L and N and T are all common, and it moves E out of position 5.

But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but wrong position. Position 5 is wrong, so E must be in 1-4. So let’s try a word like ""UNTIE"" where E is in position 4. Or ""UNTEL"" (but UNTEL isn’t a valid word). 

""ELINT"" is valid (though uncommon). Let’s pick a better common word: ""UNTIE"" uses E in position 4, and all other letters are new (except I and U, which are allowed).

But to maximize information, let’s use a word with as many new letters as possible. ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E – all new except E is known.

A better choice might be ""UNTIE"" or ""ELINT"", but ""UNTIE"" is more common.

But to be simpler and more common: let’s use ""ELINT"" – no, that’s not common. ""UNTIE"" is better.

Another option: ""ELITE"" – but we can’t use R (already forbidden), and we have E in position 1, but we need to test new consonants.

Let me choose ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – all except E are new, and E is in a new position (4).

But to be more common and test more consonants, let’s pick ""ELDIN"" – no, not common.

Actually, let’s use ""UNTIE"" – it’s a valid word and meets all criteria.

But to be safe and more common, let’s use ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E – all new except E, which we know is in the word.

But wait, let’s pick a word that has E in a new position and uses common consonants. ""UNTIE"" is fine.

But to maximize information, let’s pick ""UNTIE"" – it’s valid and covers new letters.

However, let me think of a better word: ""ELINT"" is not common. ""UNTIE"" is better.

But let me pick a word that has E in position 3: like ""INLET"" – but I is new, N, L, E, T. But L and N are good.

""INLET"" has E in position 4, which is new.

But let me pick ""UNTIE"" – it’s valid and uses new letters.

So I’ll go with ""UNTIE"".

Let's process the new feedback from Guess 3 (INLET):

1. I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (slot 1).  
   So the word must start with **I**.

2. N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (slot 2).  
   This confirms slot 2 is **N**.

3. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.  
   So we can now eliminate L from consideration.

4. E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   From Guess 1 (AROSE), we know E is NOT in slot 5.  
   From Guess 2 (UNTIE), E was in slot 5 (wrong).  
   From Guess 3 (INLET), E was in slot 4 (wrong).  
   Therefore, E must be in slot 3.

5. T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).  
   So the word must end with **T**.

Current confirmed structure:  
I N E _ T  
(where _ is the remaining letter)

Letters already in the word: I, N, E, T  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, L  

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with **I N E**, ends with **T**, and has one more letter in slot 4 that hasn't been ruled out.  

Remaining possible letters (not yet tested or ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible valid words:  
- **INERT** – fits I N E R T, but R was ruled out in Guess 1.  
- **INEPT** – fits I N E P T, P is allowed.  
- **INEST** – not a valid word.  
- **INEFT** – not a valid word.  

The only valid remaining candidate is **INEPT**.

<guess>INEPT</guess>",INEPT,"Let's process the new feedback from Guess 3 (INLET):

1. I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (slot 1).  
   So the word must start with **I**.

2. N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (slot 2).  
   This confirms slot 2 is **N**.

3. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.  
   So we can now eliminate L from consideration.

4. E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   From Guess 1 (AROSE), we know E is NOT in slot 5.  
   From Guess 2 (UNTIE), E was in slot 5 (wrong).  
   From Guess 3 (INLET), E was in slot 4 (wrong).  
   Therefore, E must be in slot 3.

5. T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (slot 5).  
   So the word must end with **T**.

Current confirmed structure:  
I N E _ T  
(where _ is the remaining letter)
