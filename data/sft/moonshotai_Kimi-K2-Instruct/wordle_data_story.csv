For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to use a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starter word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some common good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with SLATE as it uses 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has been a very successful starting word for many players.

From the feedback:

- S (1st letter) is correct ⇒ Word starts with S.
- L (2nd letter) is not in the word at all.
- A (3rd letter) is not in the word at all.
- T (4th letter) is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E (5th letter) is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. S _ _ _ _
2. T appears somewhere, but not in the 4th position.
3. No L, A, E.

Letters still in play: S (position 1), T (somewhere else), and remaining consonants/vowels like I, O, U, R, N, M, P, etc.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word starting with S, containing T (not in position 4), and avoiding L, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- STUMP (but T is in 2nd position, which is fine)
- SNORT
- STRIP
- STORM (T in 2nd position)

I’ll choose STORM because it uses common letters and positions T in the 2nd spot (which was allowed since T just couldn’t be 4th).
