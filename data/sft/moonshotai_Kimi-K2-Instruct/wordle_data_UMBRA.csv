For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good opening word often has a mix of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like T, N, S, R, L). 

Considering these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S

This provides a strong foundation to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, E.
- Has five letters; we have three positions still unknown.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A and R but moves them to different positions.
2. Introduces common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.
3. Uses letters among the top remaining frequent letters (T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T: high-frequency consonant, not yet tested.
- R: known to be in the word (but we’ll move it to position 2 → still OK because AROSE had R in position 2 with “-”, so position 2 is disallowed for R; we’ll put it in position 3 here).
- A: known to be in the word (we’ll move it to position 2 since it couldn’t be in 1).

So far we know:

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 1 or 3)
- R (not in position 2 or 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, N

Positions left: 1, 2, 4, 5 for the remaining letters (since 3 is ruled out for both A and R).

We still need three more letters.  
Common unused consonants: D, L, C, B, G, M, P, F, H, K  
Common unused vowel: U (only vowel we haven’t tried).

Let’s try to place A and R in still-allowed positions while adding frequent new letters.

Possible placements:
- A could fit in 2, 4 or 5 (but 3 is out)
- R could fit in 1, 4 or 5 (but 2 and 3 are out)

A good candidate that uses A and R correctly, plus new common letters, is “DRAUL”:
- D and L haven’t appeared yet.
- U is the only remaining vowel.
- A would be in position 2 (allowed).
- R would be in position 3, but position 3 is already ruled out for R (-).  
Oops, that fails.

Try “CRUMB”:
- R in position 2, but position 2 is ruled out for R.  
Fails again.

Re-evaluate positions:
We can’t have A in 1 or 3, and R can’t be in 2 or 3.  
The overlap leaves:
- A must be in 2, 4 or 5.
- R must be in 1, 4 or 5 (but not 3).

A workable word: “CARLA” – but A repeats and N ruled out.  
Better: “DRAFT” – T already out.  
Better: “GRAFT” – same issue.

Another approach: put R in 1 and A in 2.

A possible word: “RADIO” – I and O are out.  
“RAZOR” – Z isn’t common, and R repeats.

A solid choice is “DRANK” – but N is out.

Best simple word satisfying constraints:
R A _ _ _ or _ A R _ _ or _ _ _ A R etc.

- C, W, L are new.
- R is in 2 – disallowed.  
No.

Try “FRAUD”:

- R in 2 – disallowed.  
No.

How about “CRAMP” – P new, M new – but M and P are OK, but R in 2 – disallowed.

We can use:

R _ _ A _ or R _ _ _ A  
_ A _ R _ or _ A _ _ R  
_ _ _ A R or _ _ _ R A

Among common words:

“RAGUA” – archaic, unlikely.  
“RADAR” – R and A repeat, not ideal.

“CARGO” – O out, G new but O out.

“MURAL” – M, U, L new, A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (disallowed).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 1 or 3)
- R (not in position 2 or 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, N

Positions left: 1, 2, 4, 5 for the remaining letters (since 3 is ruled out for both A and R).

We still need three more letters.  
Common unused consonants: D, L, C, B, G, M, P, F, H, K  
Common unused vowel: U (only vowel we haven’t tried).

Let’s try to place A and R in still-allowed positions while adding frequent new letters.

Possible placements:
- A could fit in 2, 4 or 5 (but 3 is out)
- R could fit in 1, 4 or 5 (but 2 and 3 are out)

A good candidate that uses A and R correctly, plus new common letters, is “DRAUL”:
- D and L haven’t appeared yet.
- U is the only remaining vowel.
- A would be in position 2 (allowed).
- R would be in position 3, but position 3 is already ruled out for R (-).  
Oops, that fails.

Try “CRUMB”:
- R in position 2, but position 2 is ruled out for R.  
Fails again.

Re-evaluate positions:
We can’t have A in 1 or 3, and R can’t be in 2 or 3.  
The overlap leaves:
- A must be in 2, 4 or 5.
- R must be in 1, 4 or 5 (but not 3).

A workable word: “CARLA” – but A repeats and N ruled out.  
Better: “DRAFT” – T already out.  
Better: “GRAFT” – same issue.

Another approach: put R in 1 and A in 2.

A possible word: “RADIO” – I and O are out.  
“RAZOR” – Z isn’t common, and R repeats.

A solid choice is “DRANK” – but N is out.

Best simple word satisfying constraints:
R A _ _ _ or _ A R _ _ or _ _ _ A R etc.

Examine: “CRAWL”
- C, W, L are new.
- R is in 2 – disallowed.  
No.

Try “BRAVO” – O out.

Try “GRAFT” – T out.

Try “FRAUD”:
- F, U, D new.
- R in 2 – disallowed.  
No.

How about “CRAMP” – P new, M new – but M and P are OK, but R in 2 – disallowed.

Let’s list all possible positions:

A must be in 2, 4 or 5.
R must be in 1, 4 or 5 (not 2 or 3).

We can use:

R _ _ A _ or R _ _ _ A  
_ A _ R _ or _ A _ _ R  
_ _ _ A R or _ _ _ R A

Among common words:

“RAGUA” – archaic, unlikely.  
“RADAR” – R and A repeat, not ideal.

“CARGO” – O out, G new but O out.

“MURAL” – M, U, L new, A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (disallowed).  
No.

“FRANC” – C new, N out.  
No.

“GRAIL” – G, L new, I out.

“GRAND” – N out.

“CRUEL” – U, E, L new, E out.

“BRAWL” – B, W, L new, R in 2 – disallowed.

“CRAWL” – same issue.

“FRAIL” – I out.

“GRAPE” – E out.

“PRAWN” – N out.

“DRAWL” – L, W new, A in 2, R in 1 – both allowed!  
This seems good.

“DRAWL”:
D, W, L are new letters.
A in 2 – allowed (wasn’t in 2 in TRAIN).
R in 1 – allowed (wasn’t in 1 in either guess).

Let’s test:
Positions:
1: R allowed
2: A allowed
3: W new
4: L new
5: D new

All constraints satisfied.

Hence, next guess: DRAWL.

We now know:

Letters that ARE in the word and their excluded positions:
- A (cannot be 1, 3, or 2 → must be 4 or 5)
- R (cannot be 2, 3, or 1 → must be 4 or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, N, D, W, L

Unused common letters that remain:
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, plus vowel U only.

We need three more distinct letters from the remaining pool (none of which have been ruled out).  
Because both A and R must occupy positions 4 and 5 (in either order), the first three positions must be filled with new letters.

The only vowel left is U, so we prefer to place it early to test quickly.

A good pattern:
_ _ U A R  (R in 5, A in 4, U in 3)

We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 2 from {B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y}.

Choosing common consonants: B and C give a valid word “CUBAR”, but that’s obscure.  
Another simple combination: F and U give “FUMAR”, but that’s not a recognized English word.

A more natural word: “HUMAR” – not valid.

Try “PUGAR” – invalid.

Instead, reverse A and R: _ _ U R A  
Choose consonants that form a word: “BURGA” – not 5-letter.

“MURRA” – invalid.

“FURCA” – invalid.

“GUPAR” – invalid.

Try a different vowel placement. Since U is the only unused vowel, and we’ve tried putting it in position 3, let’s try positions 1 or 2.

Pattern: U _ _ A R  
Need two consonants for 2 and 3.

“UMBRA” comes to mind:
- U in 1 (new), M in 2 (new), B in 3 (new), R in 5 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed).
- All letters are fresh except A and R.
- UMBRA is a recognized English word.

Check constraints:
- A in 4 – allowed.
- R in 5 – allowed.
- U, M, B never appeared before – OK.

Therefore, next guess: UMBRA.
