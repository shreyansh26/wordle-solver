For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Only the letter E is confirmed to be in the word and in the correct (last) position.  
The other four letters (S, L, A, T) are definitely not in the word at all.  
So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

Good letters remaining to try (since they are common and haven’t been ruled out) include R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, G.  
I’ll pick a new 5-letter word that:

Current known facts:
- Word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, R.
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – O (but we don’t know its position; it’s just somewhere in the word, not the last because the last is E).
  – E (and it is in the correct last position).

So positions 1-4 must be drawn from remaining available letters, avoiding S,L,A,T,C,H,R.

From the feedback:

- Position 5 is E (✓ from all guesses).
- O is in the word but is NOT in position 2 (money gave O at position 2 with just ✓, not ✓ for position).
- E is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (money gave E at position 4 with “-”, meaning E exists elsewhere).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y.

Known so far:
– Word ends with E (position 5).
– The letters O and E are both present (but E is already placed at position 5, so the other E must appear in positions 1-4, which seems impossible since the word is only 5 letters and no repeats are allowed. Wait, the feedback says E(-) at position 4, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5, this implies the word must contain E twice, which is allowed in Wordle. So the word has two E's, one at position 5 and one elsewhere (positions 1-4 but not 4).

Wait, but the feedback for money was:
M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
This means:
- M and N and Y are not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O was at position 2 and got ✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4. Since E is already confirmed at position 5, this suggests the word has an E at position 5 and possibly another E elsewhere (positions 1-3), but that would require two E's, which is unusual but possible.

But let me re-examine the feedback carefully:
For money: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
- O(✓) at position 2 means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E(-) at position 4 means E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5 from slate, this implies the word has two E's: one at position 5 and one at position 1 or 3.

So the pattern so far:
- _ O _ _ E
- And there must be another E in positions 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ E
2. _ O E _ E

Letters remaining (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common 5-letter words that fit:
- E O _ _ E: e.g., ""OBESE"" – but it starts with O, not E. ""ELOPE"" – but L is eliminated. ""EMOTE"" – M is eliminated. ""EXILE"" – X is allowed, but L is eliminated. Doesn't seem promising.
- _ O E _ E: e.g., ""DOEVE"" – not a word. ""POECE"" – not a word. ""VOICE"" – C is eliminated. ""WOEVE"" – not a word.

Wait, maybe the second E is not required. Re-reading the feedback:
slate: E(✓) at position 5.
money: E(-) at position 4 means E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5, this does not force another E; it just confirms E is in the word (already known). So the word is _ O _ _ E and uses no S,L,A,T,C,H,R,M,N,Y.

Letters left: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z plus the already known O and E.

Looking for common words: ""BOGIE"" – but G is not ruled out, I is allowed. But ""BOGIE"" has I, which is okay, but let's check: B, O, G, I, E. No eliminated letters. This seems possible.

Another: ""FOGIE"" – F, O, G, I, E. Also possible.

""POISE"" – but S is eliminated.

""VOGUE"" – U is allowed, G is allowed, but V is allowed, but this has U and G, but G is allowed.

""DOGIE"" – D, O, G, I, E. All letters allowed.

""DOWIE"" – D, O, W, I, E. Allowed.

""BOGIE"" seems like a good choice as it uses common remaining letters.

Thus, the next guess is ""BOGIE"".

- Position 5 is E (✓ from all guesses).
- O is in the word but is NOT in position 2 (money gave O at position 2 with just ✓, not ✓ for position).
- E is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (money gave E at position 4 with “-”, meaning E exists elsewhere).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y.

Known so far:
– Word ends with E (position 5).
– The letters O and E are both present (but E is already placed at position 5, so the other E must appear in positions 1-4, which seems impossible since the word is only 5 letters and no repeats are allowed. Wait, the feedback says E(-) at position 4, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5, this implies the word must contain E twice, which is allowed in Wordle. So the word has two E's, one at position 5 and one elsewhere (positions 1-4 but not 4).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Only the letter E is confirmed to be in the word and in the correct (last) position.  
The other four letters (S, L, A, T) are definitely not in the word at all.  
So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

Good letters remaining to try (since they are common and haven’t been ruled out) include R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, G.  
I’ll pick a new 5-letter word that:
- ends with E  
- uses none of S, L, A, T  
- includes several of the common remaining letters

A solid candidate that meets these criteria is “CHORE”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
- Word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, R.
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – O (but we don’t know its position; it’s just somewhere in the word, not the last because the last is E).
  – E (and it is in the correct last position).

So positions 1-4 must be drawn from remaining available letters, avoiding S,L,A,T,C,H,R.  
Remaining common letters not yet tried (and not ruled out) include: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the confirmed O.

We know O must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.  
I’d like to try a word that places O in a new spot and adds fresh common consonants.  
A good candidate is “MONEY”:
- Ends with E ✓
- Contains O and places it in position 2 (new placement)  
- Uses M, N, Y which are still unchecked and common.
- Avoids every excluded letter.

But let’s stick to more common words.  
Another common letter pair: B O W E D – D is allowed and W is allowed.  
B O W E D is a valid 5-letter word: ""bowed"".

Next, try B O D E R – R eliminated.  
Next, try B O D E M – M eliminated.  

Check other pairs: B O U N E (N eliminated), B O U L E (L eliminated).  

Valid real word: B O U N E (but N eliminated).  

Another candidate: B O V E L – L eliminated.  

Next, try B O P E D – valid, but D is allowed.  
Check if B O P E D is a word: yes, it’s archaic but valid.  

But let’s stick to more common words.  
Another common letter pair: B O W E D – D is allowed and W is allowed.  
B O W E D is a valid 5-letter word: ""bowed"".  

Check letters: B, O, W, E, D – none are eliminated.  
Pattern matches: B(✓) O(✓) W _ E.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BOOZE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters are in the word, we'll get useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Only the letter E is confirmed to be in the word and in the correct (last) position.  
The other four letters (S, L, A, T) are definitely not in the word at all.  
So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

Good letters remaining to try (since they are common and haven’t been ruled out) include R, O, N, I, C, H, U, D, M, G.  
I’ll pick a new 5-letter word that:
- ends with E  
- uses none of S, L, A, T  
- includes several of the common remaining letters

A solid candidate that meets these criteria is “CHORE”.

<guess>chore</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: chore -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
- Word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, R.
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – O (but we don’t know its position; it’s just somewhere in the word, not the last because the last is E).
  – E (and it is in the correct last position).

So positions 1-4 must be drawn from remaining available letters, avoiding S,L,A,T,C,H,R.  
Remaining common letters not yet tried (and not ruled out) include: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the confirmed O.

We know O must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.  
I’d like to try a word that places O in a new spot and adds fresh common consonants.  
A good candidate is “MONEY”:
- Ends with E ✓
- Contains O and places it in position 2 (new placement)  
- Uses M, N, Y which are still unchecked and common.
- Avoids every excluded letter.

<guess>money</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: chore -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: money -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- Position 5 is E (✓ from all guesses).
- O is in the word but is NOT in position 2 (money gave O at position 2 with just ✓, not ✓ for position).
- E is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (money gave E at position 4 with “-”, meaning E exists elsewhere).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y.

Known so far:
– Word ends with E (position 5).
– The letters O and E are both present (but E is already placed at position 5, so the other E must appear in positions 1-4, which seems impossible since the word is only 5 letters and no repeats are allowed. Wait, the feedback says E(-) at position 4, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5, this implies the word must contain E twice, which is allowed in Wordle. So the word has two E's, one at position 5 and one elsewhere (positions 1-4 but not 4).

Wait, but the feedback for money was:
M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
This means:
- M and N and Y are not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O was at position 2 and got ✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4. Since E is already confirmed at position 5, this suggests the word has an E at position 5 and possibly another E elsewhere (positions 1-3), but that would require two E's, which is unusual but possible.

But let me re-examine the feedback carefully:
For money: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
- O(✓) at position 2 means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E(-) at position 4 means E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5 from slate, this implies the word has two E's: one at position 5 and one at position 1 or 3.

So the pattern so far:
- _ O _ _ E
- And there must be another E in positions 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ E
2. _ O E _ E

Letters remaining (not eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common 5-letter words that fit:
- E O _ _ E: e.g., ""OBESE"" – but it starts with O, not E. ""ELOPE"" – but L is eliminated. ""EMOTE"" – M is eliminated. ""EXILE"" – X is allowed, but L is eliminated. Doesn't seem promising.
- _ O E _ E: e.g., ""DOEVE"" – not a word. ""POECE"" – not a word. ""VOICE"" – C is eliminated. ""WOEVE"" – not a word.

Wait, maybe the second E is not required. Re-reading the feedback:
slate: E(✓) at position 5.
money: E(-) at position 4 means E is in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have E at position 5, this does not force another E; it just confirms E is in the word (already known). So the word is _ O _ _ E and uses no S,L,A,T,C,H,R,M,N,Y.

Letters left: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z plus the already known O and E.

Looking for common words: ""BOGIE"" – but G is not ruled out, I is allowed. But ""BOGIE"" has I, which is okay, but let's check: B, O, G, I, E. No eliminated letters. This seems possible.

Another: ""FOGIE"" – F, O, G, I, E. Also possible.

""POISE"" – but S is eliminated.

""VOGUE"" – U is allowed, G is allowed, but V is allowed, but this has U and G, but G is allowed.

""DOGIE"" – D, O, G, I, E. All letters allowed.

""DOWIE"" – D, O, W, I, E. Allowed.

""BOGIE"" seems like a good choice as it uses common remaining letters.

Thus, the next guess is ""BOGIE"".

- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, G, I.

Thus the pattern is: B O _ _ E.

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated (remaining: D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
Among these, the most common combinations that form real 5-letter words are:

- B O D _ E → B O D G E (but G eliminated), B O D Y E (Y eliminated)
- B O K E… → B O K E E (invalid)
- B O V E… → B O V E R (but 6 letters)
- B O X E… → B O X E R (again 6 letters)
- B O U E… → B O U E T (invalid)

Valid remaining candidate: B O U G E (invalid, G eliminated), but B O U E D (invalid).  
Wait, check B O U G E again – G is eliminated. 

Actually, from common remaining letters: D and F are reasonable.  
Real words: B O D E D (invalid), B O D E S (S eliminated), B O D E N (N eliminated).  
Next, try B O D E R – R eliminated.  
Next, try B O D E M – M eliminated.  

Check other pairs: B O U N E (N eliminated), B O U L E (L eliminated).  

Valid real word: B O U N E (but N eliminated).  

Another candidate: B O V E L – L eliminated.  

Next, try B O P E D – valid, but D is allowed.  
Check if B O P E D is a word: yes, it’s archaic but valid.  

But let’s stick to more common words.  
Another common letter pair: B O W E D – D is allowed and W is allowed.  
B O W E D is a valid 5-letter word: ""bowed"".  

Check letters: B, O, W, E, D – none are eliminated.  
Pattern matches: B(✓) O(✓) W _ E.  

So, the next guess should be ""B O W E D"".

From the feedback:

- Position 1: B (✓) – correct.

- Position 3: W (x) – W is not in the word at all.
- Position 4: D (x) – D is not in the word at all.
- Additionally, eliminated letters from previous guesses include:
  - S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, G, I, W, D.

So the pattern is:
B O _ _ E, where positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining available letters:
From the alphabet excluding all eliminated letters so far:
- Eliminated: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, G, I, W, D.
- Remaining: F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with B O and ends with E, using only these remaining letters for positions 3 and 4.

Looking at possible combinations:
- B O F _ E: B O F F E (invalid), B O F E (invalid length).
- B O P _ E: B O P E (invalid), B O P P E (invalid).
- B O K _ E: B O K E (invalid), B O K K E (invalid).
- B O V _ E: B O V E (invalid), B O V E R (invalid length).
- B O U _ E: B O U G E (G eliminated), but B O U N E (N eliminated). Wait, B O U N E is invalid because N is eliminated. However, B O U N E is invalid anyway. Another option is B O U Z E, but that's not a valid word.
- B O Z _ E: B O Z E (invalid), B O Z Z E (invalid).

Real valid 5-letter words starting with BO and ending with E:
- B O K E H – but H is eliminated.
- B O N E S – but N and S are eliminated.
- B O R E D – R and D eliminated.
- B O X E N – X is allowed, N is not.
- B O P E E – not a word.
- B O U G E – G eliminated.
- B O V E E – not a word.
- B O D E D – D eliminated.
- B O U N E – N eliminated.
- B O P E – too short.
- B O K E – too short.

The only remaining valid 5-letter word fitting B O _ _ E with allowed letters is B O X E N, but it’s 6 letters. 

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The remaining letters are F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- B O K E – too short.
- B O P E – too short.
- B O U G E – G eliminated.
- B O X E – too short.
- B O Z E – too short.

Realizing that no standard 5-letter English word fits B O _ _ E with the remaining letters. However, ""BOKE"" is invalid (4 letters), and ""BOKER"" is invalid (6 letters). 

But looking closely, ""BONZE"" – but N and Z are allowed? Wait N is eliminated. 

Re-checking: N is from money (N eliminated). 

""BOWNE"" – W and N eliminated. 

""BOVINE"" – too long. 

""BOUZEE"" – not a word. 

""BOXED"" – D eliminated. 

""BOYCE"" – Y and C eliminated. 

""BOUGE"" – G eliminated.

""BOOZE"" – second O and Z allowed, but is it valid? Yes, ""BOOZE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check letters:
- B (✓)
- O (✓)
- O (not eliminated)
- Z (not eliminated)
- E (✓)

All letters meet the constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOZE"".

</think>
<guess>booze</guess>",booze,"From the feedback:

- Position 1: B (✓) – correct.
- Position 2: O (✓) – correct.
- Position 5: E (✓) – correct.

Letters eliminated so far:
- Position 3: W (x) – W is not in the word at all.
- Position 4: D (x) – D is not in the word at all.
- Additionally, eliminated letters from previous guesses include:
  - S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, G, I, W, D.

So the pattern is:
B O _ _ E, where positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining available letters:
From the alphabet excluding all eliminated letters so far:
- Eliminated: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, G, I, W, D.
- Remaining: F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with B O and ends with E, using only these remaining letters for positions 3 and 4.

Looking at possible combinations:
- B O F _ E: B O F F E (invalid), B O F E (invalid length).
- B O P _ E: B O P E (invalid), B O P P E (invalid).
- B O K _ E: B O K E (invalid), B O K K E (invalid).
- B O V _ E: B O V E (invalid), B O V E R (invalid length).
- B O U _ E: B O U G E (G eliminated), but B O U N E (N eliminated). Wait, B O U N E is invalid because N is eliminated. However, B O U N E is invalid anyway. Another option is B O U Z E, but that's not a valid word.
- B O Z _ E: B O Z E (invalid), B O Z Z E (invalid).

Real valid 5-letter words starting with BO and ending with E:
- B O K E H – but H is eliminated.
- B O N E S – but N and S are eliminated.
- B O R E D – R and D eliminated.
- B O X E N – X is allowed, N is not.
- B O P E E – not a word.
- B O U G E – G eliminated.
- B O V E E – not a word.
- B O D E D – D eliminated.
- B O U N E – N eliminated.
- B O P E – too short.
- B O K E – too short.

The only remaining valid 5-letter word fitting B O _ _ E with allowed letters is B O X E N, but it’s 6 letters. 

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The remaining letters are F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- B O K E – too short.
- B O P E – too short.
- B O U G E – G eliminated.
- B O X E – too short.
- B O Z E – too short.

Realizing that no standard 5-letter English word fits B O _ _ E with the remaining letters. However, ""BOKE"" is invalid (4 letters), and ""BOKER"" is invalid (6 letters). 

But looking closely, ""BONZE"" – but N and Z are allowed? Wait N is eliminated. 

Re-checking: N is from money (N eliminated). 

""BOWNE"" – W and N eliminated. 

""BOVINE"" – too long. 

""BOUZEE"" – not a word. 

""BOXED"" – D eliminated. 

""BOYCE"" – Y and C eliminated. 

""BOUGE"" – G eliminated. 

""BOUSE"" – S eliminated. 

""BOOZE"" – second O and Z allowed, but is it valid? Yes, ""BOOZE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Check letters:
- B (✓)
- O (✓)
- O (not eliminated)
- Z (not eliminated)
- E (✓)

All letters meet the constraints.

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOZE"".",Guess 6: booze -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) O(✓) Z(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
