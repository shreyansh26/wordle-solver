Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, we should choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess in Wordle typically:

1. Uses common consonants (like S, T, N, R, L)
2. Includes common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoids repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (tests many vowels)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
- S is very common in starting positions
- L, T are common consonants
- A, E are the most frequent vowels
- It tests 5 unique letters, giving maximum information

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE as the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) so it must appear somewhere else (not position 4)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

We now know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ L _ _ _
2. It definitely contains T, but not in position 4
3. It cannot contain S, A, or E

Good next consonants to test could be R, N, C, M, etc. since we haven't seen them yet. For vowels, we've only ruled out A and E, so I, O, U are still possible. Since position 1 is open, T could potentially be there (as it's not in position 4). Let's try a word like:
- FLIRT (but this has E which we know is not in the word - wait no, FLIRT has I not E)
- CLINT (C, L, I, N, T - but L is already in position 2)
- Maybe FLINT (but we know L is in position 2)
- How about BLOAT? But A is out
- GLOAT? A is out
- CLOUT? A is out

Looking at position 1: we can try T (since T isn't in position 4 and can be elsewhere). Let's try:
- TULIP (but P hasn't been tested, but we know positions 3,4,5 are open)
- Try TULIP structure: T _ L _ _ with remaining letters needing to include T somewhere

More carefully: word structure is _ L _ _ _ with T somewhere not in position 4. Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 5.

Let's try: TULIP - but U is possible, L is correct position, I is possible, P is possible. But we've placed T in position 1 which is allowed.

Wait, better structure would be to test new consonants and vowels. Since we have _ L _ _ _ and T must appear, and we need to test new letters.

How about: GLINT:
- G: new
- L: correct position 2
- I: new (possible)
- N: new
- T: must be in word, and here it's in position 5 (not 4, so allowed)

But we should maximize information - let's try:
BUILT:
- B: new
- U: new
- I: new
- L: correct position 4 (but our L is in position 2 - no, this doesn't match)
Oops, no - our L is in position 2, so structure is _ L _ _ _

So BUILT is wrong structure. Let's try:
BLUNT:
- B: new
- L: position 2 ✓
- U: new

This seems good - tests new letters while respecting known constraints.
