For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback.

Good options include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters

I'll go with STARE as it includes S, T, A, R, E which are all very common and will give good coverage for the first guess.

So far none of the letters in STARE were in the correct position (✓), but the letter R is somewhere in the word (-).  
That means the secret word:
- does NOT contain S, T, A, or E at all.  
- contains the letter R, but NOT in 4th position.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. is valid English,
2. contains R (but not in position 4),
3. avoids S, T, A, E entirely.

Good still-available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good still-available vowels: I, O, U.

Popular letters I haven't tried yet: C, L, N, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

Let me pick a word that mixes some of these and keeps R away from position 4.

- CRONY – C, R, O, N, Y (R in 2nd)  
- DRINK – D, R, I, N, K (R in 2nd)

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we have so far.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   S, T, A, E, D, I, N, K, U

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - F must be in position 1 (from F(✓)).
   - R must appear at least once and must NOT be in positions 2 or 4 (from earlier feedback).  It is also NOT in position 5 (because the last R returned (-), i.e., wrong position).  
     Therefore R must be in position 3.

3. The letter O appears (-), meaning it is somewhere in the word but not in position 4 (because the O in position 4 came back (-)).

4. Therefore the pattern we have so far is:
   F _ R _ _
   and one of the remaining blanks must contain O (but not in position 4).

5. Remaining unknown positions: 2 and 5.
   Allowed letters so far (not yet ruled out):
   B, C, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus O (since we know O is in the word but not in position 4).

6. Position 4 must be O (because it can’t be in position 4 and we have only 5 positions).  
   So the word must be: F _ R O _

7. Need a valid 5-letter word matching F _ R O _.

Possible words:
- FORGO – F O R G O
  – Check constraints:
    – F in 1st ✓
    – R in 3rd ✓
    – O must appear: yes, positions 2 and 5.
    – Letters used: F, O, R, G – none are forbidden.
    – R is in 3rd, which is allowed.
  – Looks valid.

- FEROC – but E is forbidden.

- FAROS – A and S are forbidden.

- FUROL – U is forbidden.

- FRORE – E is forbidden.

Only FORGO seems to fit all constraints.

Let’s verify:
Pattern: F _ R O _
FORGO: F O R G O
- F(✓) in position 1 – correct.
- R in position 3 – correct (not 2,4,5).
- O appears in positions 2 and 5 – okay because we know O is in the word and not in position 4.
- G is new and allowed.
- No forbidden letters used.

Therefore FORGO is a valid guess.
