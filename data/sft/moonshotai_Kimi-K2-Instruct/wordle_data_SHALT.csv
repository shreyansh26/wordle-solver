For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. 

Popular effective starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it:
1. Contains very common letters (C, R, N, E)
2. Has the highly frequent vowel 'A'
3. Covers different positions for these letters
4. Uses no repeating letters
5. Is a common word that should be in the word list

This should give good information about the presence/absence of these common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E

1. The word contains the letters S, A, T (A is fixed in the 3rd position).
2. The word pattern is _ _ A _ _ because A is in the correct position.
3. S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter) because of the ✓.
4. T is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it has -, not ✓).
5. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, M, P.
6. Current pattern: S _ A _ _

Possible candidates:
- SHADY (but H and D not ruled out yet)
- STAND (but N is forbidden)
- SALAD (but D is allowed, but L is fine)
- SLASH (but H is fine, but S is already in first position)

Let me think of a word that fits S _ A _ _ and uses common letters not yet eliminated. ""H"" is common, and ""D"" is allowed. How about SHADY? It uses H and D and Y, none of which are forbidden yet. But we need to confirm T is somewhere. T must be in position 2, 4, or 5 but not 4 (from STAMP feedback). So maybe STALK? But L is allowed and K is allowed. But in STALK, T would be in position 2, which is allowed since in STAMP T was in position 4 and got ""-"", so position 2 is fine.

Actually, let me think differently: we know S is first, A is third, and T is somewhere but not fourth. So possible positions for T are 2 or 5.

Let me try a word that puts T in position 2: STAY_ but we need a 5th letter. STAYL isn't a word. STAYS uses S twice, unlikely. STALK fits: S T A L K. Here T is in position 2, which is allowed since T was not in position 4 in STAMP. Letters used: S, T, A, L, K - none are forbidden yet (C, R, N, E, M, P are forbidden). This seems valid.

Contains very common letters (C, R, N, E)\n2. Has the highly frequent vowel \'A\'\n3. Covers different positions for these letters\n4. Uses no repeating letters\n5.

Keep A in position 3 (_ _ A _ _).\n2. Avoid C, R, N, E.\n3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.\n\nPossible options: STAMP, PLANK, BLAST, SHARK, CHALK… but SHARK and CHALK contain forbidden letters (C, R).

""H"" is common, and ""D"" is allowed. How about SHADY? It uses H and D and Y, none of which are forbidden yet. But we need to confirm T is somewhere. T must be in position 2, 4, or 5 but not 4 (from STAMP feedback). So maybe STALK? But L is allowed and K is allowed. But in STALK, T would be in position 2, which is allowed since in STAMP T was in position 4 and got ""-"", so position 2 is fine.\n\nActually, let me think differently: we know S is first, A is third, and T is somewhere but not fourth. So possible positions for T are 2 or 5.\n\nLet me try a word that puts T in position 2: STAY_ but we need a 5th letter. STAYL isn\'t a word. STAYS uses S twice, unlikely. STALK fits: S T A L K. Here T is in position 2, which is allowed since T was not in position 4 in STAMP. Letters used: S, T, A, L, K - none are forbidden yet (C, R, N, E, M, P are forbidden).

Current knowledge:

1. Pattern so far: S _ A L _ (because S is ✓ in 1st, A is ✓ in 3rd, L is ✓ in 4th).
2. T is in the word but is NOT in position 2 (from STALK feedback: T got “-”, so it’s somewhere else).
3. Forbidden letters (x-marks): C, R, N, E, M, P, K.
4. Therefore T must be in the 5th position, making the final pattern: S _ A L T
5. The only missing letter is the second position.  
   Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Common English consonants left: B, D, G, H, Y.

Valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
- SBALT – not a word  
- SHALT – valid word  
- SMALT – valid but M is forbidden  
- SPALT – not valid, P forbidden  
- SHALT is the only common valid word left that fits.

Hence the next guess is SHALT.
