For my first guess in a Wordle-style game, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, and common vowels A, E)
- ROAST (covers R, S, T and vowels O, A)
- ARISE (covers R, S and vowels A, I, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three of the most common consonants (R, N, C) and two very common vowels (A, E). This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:
- C(-) – the letter C is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter C somewhere (but not first).
- Does not contain R, A, N, or E.

Since vowels A and E are ruled out, the remaining common vowels are I, O, U.  
Consonants ruled out so far: R, N.  
We still have C, plus other common consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D, etc.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
“SPOIL” is attractive because it has S, P, O, I, L – giving us four new consonants and two new vowels, while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Another candidate is “CLOUD” – it has C, L, O, U, D.  
However, C is already known to be present, so it’s slightly more useful to try a word that also tests C in a different position, plus other new letters.  
Between these, “SPOIL” seems slightly better because it spreads the new letters across positions.

After checking, “SPOIL” does not contain R, A, N, or E, and does not place C in the first position, so it’s valid.

I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

From the latest feedback:

- S(✓): S is in position 1.
- C(-): C is in the word but is NOT in position 2.
- O(✓): O is in position 3.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters present: S, C, O
- Letters ruled out so far: R, A, N, E, P, I, L, U, T

Remaining possible consonants (excluding already ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
Remaining possible vowels (all vowels except A, E, I, U): only O is already used, so none left unused except possibly Y (semi-vowel).

So the remaining blanks are positions 2 and 4. We know C must appear somewhere, but cannot be position 2. Therefore C must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is possible, but position 4 is also possible.

Let’s consider possible valid placements:
- S _ O C _ (C in position 4)
- S _ O _ C (C in position 5)

Now, for the remaining blank, we need consonants from the allowed set. Let's try common ones like M, K, G, etc.

Possible word candidates:
- SMOCK (but C is in position 4, M is new, K is new) – but K is at position 5.
- SMOCK pattern: S M O C K – this fits S _ O _ _ and uses C in position 4, which is allowed since C cannot be position 2.
- Another candidate: SCOFF – but F is in position 4 and second F is redundant and word is less common.
- SMOCK seems like the best choice as it uses new letters M and K which haven't been tested.

Check constraints:
- S (✓) position 1
- M (new, allowed)
- O (✓) position 3
- C (must be in word, now in position 4 – allowed)
- K (new, allowed)

No ruled-out letters are used. This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, and common vowels A, E)
- ROAST (covers R, S, T and vowels O, A)
- ARISE (covers R, S and vowels A, I, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three of the most common consonants (R, N, C) and two very common vowels (A, E). This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(-) – the letter C is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter C somewhere (but not first).
- Does not contain R, A, N, or E.

Since vowels A and E are ruled out, the remaining common vowels are I, O, U.  
Consonants ruled out so far: R, N.  
We still have C, plus other common consonants like S, T, L, M, P, D, etc.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
“SPOIL” is attractive because it has S, P, O, I, L – giving us four new consonants and two new vowels, while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Another candidate is “CLOUD” – it has C, L, O, U, D.  
However, C is already known to be present, so it’s slightly more useful to try a word that also tests C in a different position, plus other new letters.  
Between these, “SPOIL” seems slightly better because it spreads the new letters across positions.

After checking, “SPOIL” does not contain R, A, N, or E, and does not place C in the first position, so it’s valid.

I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

1. The word contains: S and O.
2. The word contains: C (from guess 1) and it is NOT in position 1.
3. The word does NOT contain: R, A, N, E, P, I, L.

Positions we know so far
- Position 1: S is correct (✓).
- Position 3: O is correct (✓).

Therefore the pattern is: S _ O _ _

Remaining letters to try:
- C (must appear somewhere, but not in position 1 – already satisfied).
- Other unused common consonants: T, D, M, K, G, B, F, H, Y, W, V.
- Remaining vowel: U (since A, E, I are out).

We still have two blanks to fill.  
Good strategy: pick a word that uses C plus two new consonants and optionally U.

Candidate words:
- SCOUT – uses S C O U T; fits S _ O _ _ and contains C, U.
- STOIC – but I is ruled out.
- SCOWL – L is ruled out.
- SCUFF – too many F’s and uncommon.
- SCOFF – too many F’s and uncommon.

“SCOUT” is valid, uses all known letters (S, C, O, U) plus T, and satisfies the positional constraints.

Let’s confirm:
- S (✓) in position 1.
- C in position 2 (allowed, since C only cannot be in position 1).
- O (✓) in position 3.
- U and T are new letters not yet tested.

Looks good.
