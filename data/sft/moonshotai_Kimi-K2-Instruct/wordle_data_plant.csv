For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.)
- No duplicate letters to maximize information gain

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover 60% of the vowels
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S) which are very frequent in English
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give good feedback about which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): the letters R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A.
2. The letter A is **not** in the first position.
3. The letters R, O, S, E are **not** present anywhere in the word.

To maximize new information on the second guess:
- We want to keep the A but move it to a new position.
- We need five new consonants (since R, S are ruled out) and one new vowel (O, E are ruled out), and A is already known.
- Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, K, B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.
- Remaining vowels: I, U.

A good candidate is ""TAILY"":
- Contains A (and moves it to position 2).
- Uses T, I, L, Y which are all new letters.
- Uses I, the next most common vowel after A.
- Uses common consonants T, L, Y.

Another candidate is ""PAINT"":
- Contains A (moved to position 2).
- Uses P, N, I, T which are new letters.

Between these, ""PAINT"" uses very common letters (P, N, T, I) and keeps the known A in a new position.

From the new feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)  
Guess 2: PAINT → P(✓), A(-), I(x), N(✓), T(✓)

What we now know for certain:

1. Letters that are present: P, A, N, T  
   – They are somewhere in the word, but not necessarily in the positions shown.
2. Letters that are absent: R, O, S, E, I  
3. Position information:
   – P is in position 1 (✓) → So the word starts with P.
   – N is in position 4 (✓) → So the word has N in the 4th spot.
   – T is in position 5 (✓) → So the word ends with T.
   – A is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because in PAINT it was marked “-”).

So the structure revealed so far is:
P _ _ N T

We must place the letter A (since it is confirmed in the word) in one of the remaining slots (positions 2, 3, or 4), but **not** in position 2 (because A was marked “-” in PAINT position 2). However, position 4 is already occupied by N. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is position 3.

Hence, the word must be: P A A N T. But that contains a double A, and we have no evidence that double letters are involved. Also, PAANT is not a valid English word.

This contradiction implies our assumption must be re-examined.

Recheck the interpretation of “-” vs “✓”:

- “-” means the letter is in the word but NOT in that exact spot.
- “✓” means it IS in that exact spot.

Therefore:
- P is in position 1 (✓) → Word starts with P.
- N is in position 4 (✓) → Word has N in position 4.
- T is in position 5 (✓) → Word ends with T.
- A is somewhere in the word **except** position 2 (because in PAINT position 2 was marked “-”). So A can only be in position 3.

So pattern must be: P _ A N T.

The only missing letter is position 2. We need a single consonant that has not been tested yet (and is not R, S, O, E, I). The list of unused common consonants includes B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant that hasn’t been used. The letter “L” is common and fits well, forming PLANT, which is a valid English word.

Check: PLANT satisfies all constraints:
- Starts with P (✓).
- Ends with T (✓).
- Has N in position 4 (✓).
- Has A in position 3 (allowed since A cannot be in position 2).
- No R, O, S, E, I (all absent).
