For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. This is a strategic approach known as a ""starting word"" that uses frequently occurring letters. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some correct letters or positions early on.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are **not** in the word at all (marked with x).
- Only the letter **S** is confirmed to be in the word and in the **correct final position** (position 5).

So we know:
- The secret word ends with S.
- It contains none of A, R, O, E.
- It must still be a valid 5-letter English word.

Now I need to pick a new word that:
1. Has S in the 5th position.
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more info (like T, N, L, I, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is **UNITS**:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains no A, R, O, E ✓
- Uses common letters U, N, I, T to test for presence and positions.

Other possible words ending in S without those letters: DUNKS, BUNKS, LUNGS, etc.

- S(✓) → S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
- K(x) → K is **not** in the word.  
- S(-) → the final S is NOT in position 5 (contradicts our earlier assumption!).

Important re-interpretation:  
- The last S in DISKS was marked “-”, which means an S **exists** in the word but is NOT in position 5.  
- Therefore **position 5 is NOT S** (we must discard the earlier conclusion that the word ends in S).  
- The S shown as ✓ in position 3 from DISKS tells us **S is in position 3**, not position 5.

So updated constraints:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Position 2 = I (from DISKS).  
3. Position 3 = S (from DISKS).  
4. Letters **definitely absent**: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, D, K.  
5. Still need to determine letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

We have the pattern: _ I S _ _

We need 3 distinct letters for slots 1, 4, 5 taken from the remaining alphabet excluding the eliminated ones.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: none (I is already used; A, O, E, U eliminated).  
So the other two letters must be consonants.

I’ll choose a word that fits _ I S _ _, uses new consonants, and is a valid English word.

Candidate choices:
- FISBY? Not valid.  
- HISP? Too short.  
- LISP? Ends in P but is only 4 letters.  
- PISMO? Invalid.  
- VISTA? But A and T eliminated.  
- WISPY? Uses P and Y, and Y can act as a vowel sometimes.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This is a strategic approach known as a ""starting word"" that uses frequently occurring letters. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some correct letters or positions early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are **not** in the word at all (marked with x).
- Only the letter **S** is confirmed to be in the word and in the **correct final position** (position 5).

So we know:
- The secret word ends with S.
- It contains none of A, R, O, E.
- It must still be a valid 5-letter English word.

Now I need to pick a new word that:
1. Has S in the 5th position.
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more info (like T, N, L, I, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is **UNITS**:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains no A, R, O, E ✓
- Uses common letters U, N, I, T to test for presence and positions.

Other possible words ending in S without those letters: DUNKS, BUNKS, LUNGS, etc.
But **UNITS** seems most balanced to test new letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the latest feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
• S is in the word and in the correct final position (5).  

Guess 2: UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
• U, N, T are not in the word at all.  
• I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).  
• S is confirmed again but is NOT in position 4 (since it was marked “-” rather than “✓”).

So we now know:
1. The word ends in S (position 5).  
2. The letters A, R, O, E, U, N, T are not present.  
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
4. We still have the letters B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z to explore (plus I).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains I (not in position 3).  
- Doesn’t use any of the eliminated letters above.

Good consonants to test next are D, L, H, K, M, P, etc., and we can try I in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Candidate word: DISKS  
- Ends in S ✓  
- Contains I in position 2 (safe, not position 3) ✓  
- Uses new letters D and K ✓  
- Uses S again (but only once in the word, so no duplication issue) ✓  

Check that it avoids all eliminated letters: no A, R, O, E, U, N, T.
DISKS satisfies this.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,MISSY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. This is a strategic approach known as a ""starting word"" that uses frequently occurring letters. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some correct letters or positions early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are **not** in the word at all (marked with x).
- Only the letter **S** is confirmed to be in the word and in the **correct final position** (position 5).

So we know:
- The secret word ends with S.
- It contains none of A, R, O, E.
- It must still be a valid 5-letter English word.

Now I need to pick a new word that:
1. Has S in the 5th position.
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more info (like T, N, L, I, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is **UNITS**:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains no A, R, O, E ✓
- Uses common letters U, N, I, T to test for presence and positions.

Other possible words ending in S without those letters: DUNKS, BUNKS, LUNGS, etc.
But **UNITS** seems most balanced to test new letters.

<guess>UNITS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the latest feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
• S is in the word and in the correct final position (5).  

Guess 2: UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
• U, N, T are not in the word at all.  
• I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).  
• S is confirmed again but is NOT in position 4 (since it was marked “-” rather than “✓”).

So we now know:
1. The word ends in S (position 5).  
2. The letters A, R, O, E, U, N, T are not present.  
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
4. We still have the letters B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z to explore (plus I).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains I (not in position 3).  
- Doesn’t use any of the eliminated letters above.

Good consonants to test next are D, L, H, K, M, P, etc., and we can try I in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Candidate word: DISKS  
- Ends in S ✓  
- Contains I in position 2 (safe, not position 3) ✓  
- Uses new letters D and K ✓  
- Uses S again (but only once in the word, so no duplication issue) ✓  

Check that it avoids all eliminated letters: no A, R, O, E, U, N, T.
DISKS satisfies this.

<guess>DISKS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)
Guess 3: DISKS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback from guess 3.

Guess 3: DISKS  
Feedback:  
- D(x) → D is **not** in the word.  
- I(✓) → I is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
- S(✓) → S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
- K(x) → K is **not** in the word.  
- S(-) → the final S is NOT in position 5 (contradicts our earlier assumption!).

Important re-interpretation:  
- The last S in DISKS was marked “-”, which means an S **exists** in the word but is NOT in position 5.  
- Therefore **position 5 is NOT S** (we must discard the earlier conclusion that the word ends in S).  
- The S shown as ✓ in position 3 from DISKS tells us **S is in position 3**, not position 5.

So updated constraints:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Position 2 = I (from DISKS).  
3. Position 3 = S (from DISKS).  
4. Letters **definitely absent**: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, D, K.  
5. Still need to determine letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

We have the pattern: _ I S _ _

We need 3 distinct letters for slots 1, 4, 5 taken from the remaining alphabet excluding the eliminated ones.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: none (I is already used; A, O, E, U eliminated).  
So the other two letters must be consonants.

I’ll choose a word that fits _ I S _ _, uses new consonants, and is a valid English word.

Candidate choices:
- FISBY? Not valid.  
- HISP? Too short.  
- LISP? Ends in P but is only 4 letters.  
- PISMO? Invalid.  
- VISTA? But A and T eliminated.  
- WISPY? Uses P and Y, and Y can act as a vowel sometimes.  
Check: W, I, S, P, Y → W is still allowed, I and S fixed, P and Y not tested yet.  
WISPY is a valid 5-letter word.  
Pattern: W I S P Y → fits _ I S _ _ with no forbidden letters.

Guess 3: DISKS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) S(-)
Guess 4: WISPY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) S(✓) P(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list everything we now know.

Known letters and positions  
• Position 2 = I (✓ from DISKS & WISPY)  
• Position 3 = S (✓ from DISKS & WISPY)  
• Position 5 = Y (✓ from WISPY)

So the pattern is: _ I S _ Y

Letters definitely **not** in the word  
A, R, O, E, U, N, T, D, K, W, P

Remaining consonants that have **not** been ruled out  
B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, V, X, Z  
(We also have no vowels left except the already-placed I and Y.)

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4.

Possible valid English words fitting _ I S _ Y:

- BISKY  – invalid (no standard word)  
- CIVVY  – invalid (uses V twice, V not tested yet but double-V unlikely)  
- FISHY  – uses F, H (H not yet eliminated)  
- GISPY  – invalid spelling  
- JISMY  – invalid  
- LISPY  – uses L, P; P is eliminated  
- MISTY  – uses M, T; T is eliminated  
- VISTY  – invalid  
- WISPY  – already tried  
- FISHY  – F (allowed), I (fixed), S (fixed), H (allowed), Y (fixed)  
  Pattern: F I S H Y

FISHY fits all constraints and uses only letters not yet eliminated.
