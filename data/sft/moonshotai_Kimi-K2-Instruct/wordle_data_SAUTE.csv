This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that can help me gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct (either in position or just present in the word).

Some popular and effective first guesses in Wordle include words like SLATE, CRANE, STARE, ORATE, ARISE, etc. These words contain a mix of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R, L, N) that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""STARE"" because it includes:
- S and T (very common consonants, often at start or middle)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)
This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

We know:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- E is in position 5 (✓).
- T and A are somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (-).
- R is not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern looks like: S _ _ _ E

Letters we still need to place: T, A, and two others.

Since T and A are “in the word but wrong position”, T can’t be in position 2 and A can’t be in position 3, but they could go elsewhere. Because R is excluded, we also have to avoid any word containing R.

A good next word would:
1. Re-use S and E in their known spots.
2. Place T and A in new positions to check where they belong.
3. Introduce a couple of new common consonants (e.g., L, N, C, P, etc.) to gather more information.

One candidate is “SLATE”.  
- S and E keep their positions.  
- L, A, T are new placements for A and T (A now in position 4 instead of 3, T now in position 3 instead of 2) and L is a fresh consonant.

Another candidate is “SPACE”.  
- Keeps S and E correct.  
- Introduces P and C, and places A in position 2, T in position 4 (but we don’t have T in SPACE).

Instead let’s use “STALE”.  
- S and E stay put.  
- T is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only excluded from 2 in the previous guess, but now it’s being tested in 2 again—actually no, we saw T cannot be in position 2 from the feedback).  
Wait, no: the feedback said T is in the word but wrong position; in STARE, T was in position 2, so T cannot be in position 2 again. Therefore T must go to 3 or 4.

Let’s pick “STANE”:  
S _ _ _ E, with T and A placed in 3 and 2 respectively.  
However, “STANE” is not a common English word.

“SNAKE” is a valid word:  
S (1) N (2) A (3) K (4) E (5).  
Here, A is in position 3—which was originally excluded for A (because in STARE A was in 3). So A can’t be in 3.  

“STAKE”: S T A K E  
Again A is in 3, which was excluded.

Let’s try “SLATE”:  
S L A T E  
A is now in 3 (forbidden).  

“SPATE”: S P A T E  
A in 3 again.

“SCALE”: S C A L E  
A in 3 again.

“STAVE”: S T A V E  
A in 3 again.

I need a word with S _ _ _ E, containing T and A somewhere else, and no R.

Let’s try “SALET”: but that’s 5 letters, but it would be S A L E T — but E is already fixed in 5, so T would have to be in 4.  
Word is “SALET” is valid but not common.

Actually, the correct approach is to place T and A in allowed positions.

Let’s try “SWEAT”:  
S W E A T — but E is fixed at position 5, so this doesn’t fit.

Another candidate: “SATED”  
S A T E D — positions: S (1) A (2) T (3) E (4) D (5)  
But E must be in 5, so this doesn’t work.

We need S _ _ _ E.

So T and A must go into positions 2-4 but:
- A cannot be in 3.
- T cannot be in 2.

Possible placements:
T must be in 3 or 4.
A must be in 2 or 4.

Let’s try “SALTE” — but that’s not a valid word.

“SAUTE”: S A U T E  
A in 2, T in 4. This respects the constraints.

“SAUTE” is a valid English word meaning to cook quickly in a little fat.
