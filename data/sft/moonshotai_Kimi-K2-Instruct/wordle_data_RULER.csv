For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Classic starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of possible letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → it is NOT in position 2.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → it is NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: L, E (and they cannot be in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

Next guess should:
1. Include L and E to test new positions for them.
2. Avoid S, A, T.
3. Introduce new common consonants and possibly another vowel.

Good candidate: ""OLDER""
- O (new vowel)
- L (known in word, now in position 2)
- D (new consonant)
- E (known in word, now in position 4)
- R (new consonant)

This tests L in position 2 (invalid per feedback, so this is wrong). Let me rethink.

Alternative: ""PLIER""
- P (new)
- L (known, position 2 - but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
Hmm, position 2 is bad for L.

Better: ""ELBOW""
- E (position 1)
- L (position 2) - again position 2 for L is invalid.

Best: ""CRUEL""
- C (new)
- R (new)
- U (new vowel)
- E (position 4)
- L (position 5)

But L cannot be in position 5 (no restriction yet), and E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE feedback). Actually E in SLATE was position 5 (-), so E is wrong in position 5, but position 4 is fine.

Wait, let me choose ""CRUEL"" - it has L in position 5 (no restriction), E in position 4 (allowed), and introduces C, R, U.

But maybe simpler: ""BLEED""
- B (new)
- L (position 2 - invalid, feedback says L is not in position 2)

""ELDER"" - E in position 1, L in position 2 (invalid), D, E, R.

""RELIC"" - R, E (position 2), L (position 3), I, C.
This looks good:

Let’s capture what we now know:

Letters in the word and in their correct positions:

Letters not in the word:

- I, C (from RELIC)

So far the pattern is: R _ L _ _

We still need letters 2 and 5. E is confirmed to be in the word, but cannot be in position 2. Therefore E must be in position 5.

Thus the word so far is: R _ L _ E

Valid English five-letter words fitting R _ L _ E:
- RULER
- RIFLE (but F isn’t confirmed and I is ruled out)
- ROULE (not a common word)
- RUBLE (B isn’t ruled out)

The most common and likely word fitting R _ L _ E is RULER.

Let’s verify:
- R: ✓ (position 1) – matches.
- U: new letter – worth testing.
- L: ✓ (position 3) – matches.
- E: must be in position 5 – matches known constraint.
- R: already in position 1, so it’s a repeat – but RULER is a valid word with R at start and end.

Thus RULER is a strong candidate.
