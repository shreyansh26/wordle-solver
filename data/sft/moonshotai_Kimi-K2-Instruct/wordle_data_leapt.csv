For the first guess, there's no prior information, so the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. Common consonants like T, N, S, R, and L, along with common vowels like A, E, I, O, and U, are good choices. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: The most common vowel in English

This combination provides a good spread of frequently used letters, which can help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the correct position (✓) – so A is the 3rd letter.
- L, T, E are in the word but not in their current spots (-).
- Letters that have never been tested yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We now know:
- Word is _ _ A _ _
- Letters L, T, E appear somewhere in the word but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively.
- We should avoid S and any other letters already marked x.

Best second guesses usually keep the known letter A in place and try new letters that are common and haven’t been tested. A good candidate is “CLART” but T is already known to be in the word but not in position 4, so putting T at the end is okay. 

However, let’s pick a word that:
- keeps A in the 3rd spot,
- uses L somewhere not in 2nd place,
- uses T somewhere not in 4th place,
- introduces new common consonants R and N.

A strong choice is “PLANT”:
- P – new letter,
- L – known in word but now in position 2 (allowed),
- A – locked in 3rd,
- N – new letter,
- T – known in word but now in position 5 (allowed).

So PLANT is a good second guess.

After two guesses we know:
1. Pattern: _ _ A _ T
2. Letters definitely present: A (position 3), T (position 5).
3. Letters somewhere in the word, but NOT in the positions they have already been tried:
   - L (cannot be 2 or 4 because it appeared in 2 and 4 and both got “-”)
   - P (cannot be 1)
4. Letters definitely absent: S, N
5. Letters never used yet (among common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, R, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions for L: 1 or 5. 5 is taken by T, so L must be 1.

So the word starts with L and looks like: L _ A _ T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with L
- has A in position 3
- ends with T
- does not contain S or N
- uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- LEAPT – but E was ruled out (in SLATE position 5 got “-”) and T is already fixed at end; however E has not been ruled out entirely, just not allowed in position 5.
- LIART – but I is new and R is new.
- LAZYT – but Z is uncommon and Y is new.
- LEANT – N is ruled out.

A better candidate is LEAPT: L E A P T.  But P already was tried at position 1 and got “-”, so P cannot be at position 4 (but is allowed elsewhere).  
Actually, P was in position 1 and got “-”, so it can go elsewhere.

Let’s pick a word that fits L _ A _ T and introduces common letters:  
BLAST – S is out.  
CLAPT – C is new, L is already in word.  
FLATT – double T, but only 1 T allowed? Not sure.

Another candidate is LEAPT.  It fits the pattern L E A P T and uses E, P in new positions.

But to maximize new information, let’s pick a word that keeps L in 1, introduces R and I:  
LIART – but ends with T, pattern L I A R T.  
This uses I and R, both new, and fits all constraints.

However, I is a vowel, and we already have A, so perhaps better to use a consonant.

Another word: CLART – but C is new, L is already in word, position 2 is new.  
But C is new, L already confirmed in word, A is in place, R is new, T is in place.

But L must be in position 1, not 2.

Another candidate: LEAPT – L E A P T.  
E was in position 5 in SLATE and got “-”, so E cannot be in position 5 but can be elsewhere.  
P was in position 1 and got “-”, so P can be in position 4.

So LEAPT is valid:
- L (position 1) – confirmed must be here.
- E (position 2) – allowed (only position 5 ruled out for E).
- A (position 3) – correct.
- P (position 4) – allowed (only position 1 ruled out for P).
- T (position 5) – correct.

This seems like the best next guess.
