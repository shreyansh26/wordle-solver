For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Options like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" are popular, but I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the top 6 most common letters. This should give us good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

We now have two pieces of feedback.

AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
FRONT → F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) T(x)

Key facts extracted:
1. The third letter is O.
2. The letter R is present somewhere in the word, but explicitly NOT in positions 2 or 3.
   - From AROSE: R is not in position 2 (feedback “-” = wrong position).
   - From FRONT: R is again not in position 2 (feedback “-”).
3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, S, E, F, N, T.

Letters still unknown / possible: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R and O already confirmed.

R must therefore be in positions 1, 4, or 5, because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out.

We also want to test new common consonants and vowels not yet used. The best unused vowels are I and U. Common consonants left include D, G, L, M, P, C, B.

Let’s choose a word that
- keeps O in position 3,
- places R in either 1, 4, or 5,
- introduces new letters we haven’t tried yet.

One candidate that satisfies these conditions and uses common letters: “PROUD”
- P (new)
- R (newly placed in position 2 → but wait, position 2 was already ruled out for R; we need to avoid that.

So “PROUD” would be invalid because R is again in position 2.

Next candidate: “GROUT” – but T is already ruled out.

Next: “GROWN” – N is ruled out.

Next: “GROUP” – P is new, U is new, R in position 2 again – still invalid.

Next try: “BROKE” – K and B are new, but E is ruled out.

Next: “DROOP” – P is fine, but O repeats and gives no new info.

Next: “CROOK” – same issue with repeated O.

Next: “TROOP” – T is ruled out.

Next: “CROWD” – D is new, W is new, R in position 2 – still invalid.

Therefore we need to place R in position 1, 4, or 5. Let’s try position 1. A good word with R in position 1 and O in position 3 that uses new common letters: “RUMOR”. But O repeats, not ideal.

Another: “ROBIN” – N is ruled out.

Another: “ROGUE” – E is ruled out.

Another: “ROCKY” – C, K, Y are new, but Y is less common.

A better choice: “ROUND” – N is ruled out.

Another: “RODEO” – O repeats.

Another: “ROYAL” – A is ruled out.

Another: “ROMPS” – S is ruled out.

Another: “ROOTS” – S is ruled out.

Another: “ROOMY” – M is new, Y is new, but O repeats.

Another approach: place R in position 4. Candidate: “MOTOR” – T is ruled out.

Another: “COLOR” – L is new, C is new, R in position 5.

“COLOR” satisfies:
- C and L are new, O in position 3, R in position 5, O is repeated but still gives new letters C, L, R in 5.

But COLOR has O twice, which is redundant.

A better candidate to avoid repeats and use new letters: “CROUP” – C, U, P new, R in position 2 – again ruled out.

Next candidate: “DROOL” – D, L new, R in 1, O in 3, but repeats O.

“DROOL” still introduces D and L, which are new.

But let’s try to avoid repeated O.

Next candidate: “GOURD” – G, U, R, D new, R in position 3 – invalid, must be 1,4,5.

Next: “GOURD” doesn’t fit.

Next: “HUMOR” – H, M, U new, R in 5.

This looks good:
H U M O R
- H, U, M new
- O in 3
- R in 5 (a valid position)

No letter repeats, and we test new letters.

Therefore the next guess is “HUMOR”.

“DROOL” still introduces D and L, which are new.

   - From FRONT: R is again not in position 2 (feedback “-”).
3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, S, E, F, N, T.

Letters still unknown / possible: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R and O already confirmed.

R must therefore be in positions 1, 4, or 5, because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out.

We also want to test new common consonants and vowels not yet used. The best unused vowels are I and U. Common consonants left include D, G, L, M, P, C, B.

Let’s choose a word that
- keeps O in position 3,
- places R in either 1, 4, or 5,
- introduces new letters we haven’t tried yet.

One candidate that satisfies these conditions and uses common letters: “PROUD”
- P (new)
- R (newly placed in position 2 → but wait, position 2 was already ruled out for R; we need to avoid that.

So “PROUD” would be invalid because R is again in position 2.

Next candidate: “GROUT” – but T is already ruled out.

Next: “GROWN” – N is ruled out.

Next: “GROUP” – P is new, U is new, R in position 2 again – still invalid.

Next try: “BROKE” – K and B are new, but E is ruled out.

Next: “DROOP” – P is fine, but O repeats and gives no new info.

Next: “CROOK” – same issue with repeated O.

Next: “TROOP” – T is ruled out.

Next: “CROWD” – D is new, W is new, R in position 2 – still invalid.

Therefore we need to place R in position 1, 4, or 5. Let’s try position 1. A good word with R in position 1 and O in position 3 that uses new common letters: “RUMOR”. But O repeats, not ideal.

Another: “ROBIN” – N is ruled out.

Another: “ROGUE” – E is ruled out.

Another: “ROCKY” – C, K, Y are new, but Y is less common.

A better choice: “ROUND” – N is ruled out.

Another: “RODEO” – O repeats.

Another: “ROYAL” – A is ruled out.

Another: “ROMPS” – S is ruled out.

Another: “ROOTS” – S is ruled out.

Another: “ROOMY” – M is new, Y is new, but O repeats.

Another approach: place R in position 4. Candidate: “MOTOR” – T is ruled out.

Another: “COLOR” – L is new, C is new, R in position 5.

“COLOR” satisfies:
- C and L are new, O in position 3, R in position 5, O is repeated but still gives new letters C, L, R in 5.

But COLOR has O twice, which is redundant.

A better candidate to avoid repeats and use new letters: “CROUP” – C, U, P new, R in position 2 – again ruled out.

Next candidate: “DROOL” – D, L new, R in 1, O in 3, but repeats O.

“DROOL” still introduces D and L, which are new.

But let’s try to avoid repeated O.

Next candidate: “GOURD” – G, U, R, D new, R in position 3 – invalid, must be 1,4,5.

Next: “GOURD” doesn’t fit.

Next: “HUMOR” – H, M, U new, R in 5.

This looks good:
H U M O R
- H, U, M new
- O in 3
- R in 5 (a valid position)

No letter repeats, and we test new letters.

Therefore the next guess is “HUMOR”.

Let me consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, S, E, F, N, T, U, M

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- R (shown by “-” in both earlier guesses) — but we still don’t know its correct spot.
- O (shown by “✓” in positions 3) — but now HUMOR gives “O(-)” (i.e. O is in the word but NOT in position 4).  
  That conflicts with earlier “✓” for O in position 3.  
  Therefore the only consistent interpretation is:
      – O is definitely in the word.
      – O is NOT in position 4 (from HUMOR feedback), and we already know O is NOT in position 3 (because the feedback was “✓” only for position 3 in previous guesses, and now “-” for position 4).  
      Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Original feedback after AROSE: O(✓) — meaning O is in the word and in position 3.  
Then FRONT: O(✓) — confirms O in position 3 again.  
But HUMOR says O(-), which would normally mean “correct letter but wrong position” — but we already know O is in position 3, so it should be “✓” if it’s in the right spot. The only way for HUMOR’s O(-) to be consistent is if the actual secret word has O in position 3 and HUMOR’s O (position 4) is simply wrong position. That’s fine; it doesn’t contradict position 3 being correct.

So summarizing:
1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. R is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2 (from AROSE, FRONT) and now NOT in position 5 (from HUMOR). Therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, F, N, T, U, M, H (from HUMOR’s H(-) being wrong position shows H is in the word but not position 1; but HUMOR gave H(-) — actually, HUMOR feedback was H(-), which means H is in the word but not in position 1. So H is in the word somewhere but not position 1.

Wait, let me re-state carefully:

- From HUMOR feedback:
  H(-) → H is in the word but not in position 1.
  U(x) → U not in word.
  M(x) → M not in word.
  O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent with O being in position 3).
  R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 5.

So updated:
- R is in word: cannot be positions 2, 3, or 5 (from all feedback). Therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.
- H is in word: cannot be position 1 (from HUMOR). So H must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O. So H must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- O is in position 3.
- Letters banned: A,S,E,F,N,T,U,M

Valid letters left for other positions: B,C,D,G,I,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus H and R (with constraints).

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places R in position 1 or 4.
- Places H somewhere allowed (positions 2,4,5).
- Uses new common letters.

Candidate: “CHORD”
- C (new)
- H (allowed in position 2)
- O (position 3)
- R (allowed in position 4)
- D (new)

Checks:
- No banned letters.
- R in position 4 is allowed.
- H in position 2 is allowed.

This tests new letters C and D, places H and R in compliant spots, and keeps O fixed.
