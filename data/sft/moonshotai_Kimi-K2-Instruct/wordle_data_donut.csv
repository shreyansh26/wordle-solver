Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are often vowels (like E, A, O, I) and consonants (like T, N, S, R, L). 

A good starting strategy is to pick a word that contains a mix of common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm the presence of these letters. The word ""RAISE"" is a common choice among Wordle solvers because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters correctly, either in position or existence.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) were marked “x,” which means none of them appear in the secret word at all. That’s unusually strong negative information: we now know the final word contains none of those five very common letters.

To maximize the information in the next guess, I should pick a word that uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet. The next most frequent English letters are T, N, O, L, U, C, D, P, M, Y, etc. Ideally I want a word that mixes several new vowels (since we just eliminated A, I, E) and consonants.

Among the remaining vowels, O and U are the most common. The consonants T, N, L, C, D, P, M are still in play.

One balanced choice is “COUNT”:
- C – common consonant
- O – common vowel
- U – common vowel
- N – very common consonant
- T – very common consonant

This word uses five entirely new letters (none were in RAISE) and gives good coverage of remaining high-frequency characters.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, C
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct spot: O (2nd position), T (5th position)
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong spot: U, N (somewhere other than 3rd or 4th)

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has T in position 5.
3. Uses U and N somewhere (but U cannot be 3rd, N cannot be 4th).
4. Uses none of R, A, I, S, E, C.

Possible placements for U and N:
- U could be 1st, 4th (not 3rd).
- N could be 1st, 3rd (not 4th).

Let’s look for common words matching _ O _ _ T that fit these constraints.

Some candidate words:
- DONUT: D, O, N, U, T → uses N and U in valid positions, no banned letters.
- JOINT: J is allowed, but I is banned → invalid (I).
- MOUNT: M is allowed, N and U placements fit → valid.
- POUCH: C is banned → invalid.
- BOUNT: Not a valid English word.
- WOUND: W is allowed, positions fit → valid.

Among these, MOUNT and WOUND both fit, but MOUNT has more common letters. So MOUNT seems best.

Check positions:
- M (1st) – allowed
- O (2nd) – correct
- U (3rd) – but feedback says U is in the word but NOT in 3rd position → U cannot be 3rd → MOUNT invalid because it places U in 3rd.

Next best: WOUND
- W (1st) – allowed
- O (2nd) – correct
- U (3rd) – again, U is banned from 3rd → invalid.

DONUT:
- D (1st) – allowed
- O (2nd) – correct
- N (3rd) – allowed (feedback said N is in the word but was in 4th in COUNT; now placing it in 3rd is fine)
- U (4th) – allowed (was 3rd in COUNT; now 4th is fine)
- T (5th) – correct

No banned letters, and U/N placements satisfy their constraints. DONUT seems valid.

Another candidate: BLOWN – but L is not yet tested, but we have no info on B, L, W yet. However, DONUT uses both U and N which we know are in the word, so it’s better.

Thus, DONUT is the best immediate choice.
