For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained. A common strategy is to use a word with several vowels and frequently used consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This should provide good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are present in the word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
- Letters NOT present: S, A, T, E
- Letter L is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.

I need a word that:
1. Contains L
2. Has no S, A, T, E
3. Uses other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U) to maximize information.

Good consonants left to test: R, N, D, C, B, M, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

A good candidate word would be ""FLING"":
- F - common consonant not tested yet
- L - we know it's in the word (from feedback)
- I - remaining vowel
- N - common consonant
- G - common consonant

This tests new letters while incorporating the known L in a different position (position 2 instead of 3).

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, F, N.

Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in the wrong positions):
- L (from both guesses: in SLATE it was position 2, in FLING it was position 2 again – so L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- I (from FLING, was in position 3, so I must be elsewhere)
- G (from FLING, was in position 5, so G must be elsewhere)

Remaining vowels to explore: O, U (since A, E are out and I is already confirmed in the word)
Remaining common consonants to test: R, D, C, B, M, P, H, Y, etc.

A good next word needs to:
1. Place L in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding 2).
2. Place I somewhere other than position 3.
3. Place G somewhere other than position 5.
4. Introduce new consonants and possibly vowels.

Let’s try a word that moves L to position 4, I to position 2, and G to position 3, while adding new consonants R and D:

R I G L D → ""RIGLD"" – but that’s not a valid word.

Another arrangement: L I G H T – but T is out.

Alternative: L O G I C – but C is new and I and G are confirmed in the word; however, this word has L in position 1 (valid), I in position 4 (valid), G in position 3 (valid), and introduces O and C. It’s also a valid English word.

But let’s double-check the constraints:
- L must be in positions 1,3,4,5: here it’s in 1 → valid.
- I must not be in position 3: here it’s in 4 → valid.
- G must not be in position 5: here it’s in 3 → valid.
- No disallowed letters: S,A,T,E,F,N are absent.
- Introduces new letters O and C.

Let’s extract everything we can from the three rounds of feedback.

Letters that are NOT in the word (marked with x):
- S, A, T, E (from SLATE)
- F, N (from FLING)
- O, C (from LOGIC)

So the **forbidden set** is: {S, A, T, E, F, N, O, C}

Letters that ARE in the word, but currently in the wrong positions (marked with –):
- L – appeared in position 2 in SLATE, position 2 in FLING, and position 1 in LOGIC.
  Therefore L cannot be in positions 1 or 2; it must be in 3, 4 or 5.
- I – appeared in position 3 in FLING and position 4 in LOGIC.
  Therefore I cannot be in positions 3 or 4; it must be in 1, 2 or 5.
- G – appeared in position 5 in FLING and position 3 in LOGIC.
  Therefore G cannot be in positions 3 or 5; it must be in 1, 2 or 4.

Remaining vowels that have not been ruled out: U (I is already known to be in the word, A,E,O are out).
Remaining consonants not yet tested: many, but common ones still allowed include: B, D, H, K, M, P, R, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that
1. Contains L, I, G.
2. Places L in 3,4,5; I in 1,2,5; G in 1,2,4.
3. Uses only letters outside the forbidden set.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
L: 3,4,5
I: 1,2,5
G: 1,2,4

Try to construct a word that satisfies these positional constraints and is valid English.

One systematic way is to enumerate possibilities:
- Suppose I is in position 1.
  Then G must be in 2 or 4.
  - If G is 2:
    Word starts IGL?? but L must be in 3,4,5.
    I G L _ _ – fits (L is 3). We need two more letters, none from forbidden set, to fill 4 and 5. Try I G L D U (IGLDU) – not a word. I G L D Y – not a word. Hmm.
  - If G is 4:
    I _ _ G _ – positions 2 and 3 must include L (in 3) and another letter.
    I _ L G _ – now 2 and 5 need letters. Try I D L G Y – not a word.

- Suppose I is in position 2.
  Then G must be in 1 or 4.
  - If G is 1:
    G I _ _ _ – L must be in 3,4,5.
    G I L _ _ – then 4,5 need letters. G I L D U – not valid.
  - If G is 4:
    _ I _ G _ – L must be in 3 or 5.
    _ I L G _ – position 1 needs a letter. Try B I L G Y – not valid.
    _ I _ G L – position 3 needs a letter. Try B I D G L – valid? BIDGL – no.

- Suppose I is in position 5.
  Then G must be in 1 or 2 or 4.
  - If G is 1:
    G _ _ _ I – L must be in 3 or 4.
    G _ L _ I – position 2: try H: G H L _ I – then 4: try D: G H L D I – not a word.
  - If G is 2:
    _ G _ _ I – L must be 3,4,5. 5 is I, so 3 or 4.
    _ G L _ I – try R: R G L D I – not valid.
    _ G _ L I – try D: D G B L I – not valid.
  - If G is 4:
    _ _ _ G I – L must be 3 or 5. 5 is I, so 3.
    _ _ L G I – positions 1 and 2: try B and R: B R L G I – not valid.
    Try P and D: P D L G I – not valid.
    Try B and D: B D L G I – not valid.

None of these seem to form common English words. Let me rethink.

Perhaps my strict enumeration missed a simple word. Let me step back and look for any 5-letter word that contains L, I, G without the forbidden letters and fits the positional constraints.

Browse mentally through valid words:
- GLIMY – no, Y is fine, but G is 1 and must be 1,2,4; I is 2 (allowed), L must be 3,4,5: here L is 3 – fits. M and Y are allowed. GLIMY is a valid variant of “glimsy” (though rare). Not ideal.

- RIGID – contains D, but R is allowed, I is 2 (allowed), G is 3 (forbidden), so no.

- DIGIT – contains D, I, G, but T and another I and T are forbidden.

- BRIM – no.

- BLIMP – contains B,L,I,M,P – but L is 2 (forbidden), so no.

- FLUID – F is forbidden.

- D R I L L – D, R, I, L, L – L is 4 (allowed), but L is also 5; I is 2 (allowed), G is missing.

We must include G. So let’s try harder.

Consider the word “DRILL” – doesn’t have G.

“GRILL” – has G, R, I, L, L.
- Letters: G, R, I, L, L – all allowed.
- Positions:
  G is 1 (allowed 1,2,4) – yes 1.
  R is 2 (new letter, allowed).
  I is 3 – but I must not be 3 (from FLING feedback) – so invalid.

“GIRLY” – G, I, R, L, Y.
- G is 1 (allowed).
- I is 2 (allowed).
- R is 3 (new letter, allowed).
- L is 4 (allowed).
- Y is 5 (new letter, allowed).
This word is valid English, contains all required letters (G,I,L), and satisfies the positional constraints.

Therefore, the best next guess is “GIRLY”.
