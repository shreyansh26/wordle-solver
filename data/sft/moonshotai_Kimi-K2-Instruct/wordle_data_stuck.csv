For a first guess, I want a word that contains common letters and ideally has no repeating letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good starting word would use several of these. ""AROSE"" is a classic starting word as it uses A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a nice vowel spread and some very common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S exists somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- must contain S (but not in slot 4),
- cannot contain A, R, O, or E.

Remaining common letters to try: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, Y, P, H, M, B, G, F, K.

A good next guess should:
- include the known letter S in a new position,
- avoid the eliminated letters A, R, O, E,
- use fresh common consonants and vowels.

I’ll choose “SLING”:
- S is placed in slot 1 (new position),
- L, I, N, G are common letters that weren’t in the first guess,
- no eliminated letters are reused.

Summary so far:
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, N, G  
- Letter known to be IN the word and in position 1: S  
- Therefore the word begins with S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains none of the eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, L, I, N, G.
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters (examples: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, U, Y).

A good next guess should introduce several new consonants and at least one new vowel.  
The most common remaining vowel is U.  
Among consonants still available, T, H, M, P, B, C, D, F, K, Y are attractive.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that sprinkles these fresh letters while keeping S in slot 1.  
Candidate: “STUCK” – uses S, T, U, C, K. All letters are still allowed and none have been ruled out.

But STUCK has S in spot 1 (✓). It also contains U and C and K which are all new letters.

I’ll go with “STUCK”.
