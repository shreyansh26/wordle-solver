Since this is my first guess, I have no information about the secret word. To maximize the information gained, I should choose a word with common letters in English. Common letters in 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

The word ""AROSE"" contains 5 distinct very common letters and is a valid 5-letter English word. This will help me quickly identify which of these frequent letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) — A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) — R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(-) — O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S(x) — S is not in the word.
- E(-) — E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does not contain A or S.
- It does contain R, O, and E, but none of them are in their original positions (2, 3, or 5 respectively).

Next guess should use R, O, E in new positions and avoid A and S. A good candidate is “ROVER”:
- R is moved to position 1 (allowed, since it just can’t be in pos 2).
- O is moved to position 2 (allowed, since it just can’t be in pos 3).
- E is moved to position 4 (allowed, since it just can’t be in pos 5).
- V and the second R are new letters; V is common but not in AROSE, so it gives additional info.

This guess respects all constraints and should help pin down correct positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, S, V  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positional constraints:
   - E: must be in position 4 (from ROVER feedback: E ✓ in 4th slot)
   - R: must appear at least twice (because both R’s in ROVER earned ✓ or -), and it **cannot** be in positions 2 (from AROSE) or 1 (from ROVER).  
   - O: must be in the word, but **cannot** be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and ROVER).  
3. Therefore:
   - R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. But 4 is already taken by E. So R is in 3 or 5.
   - O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5. 4 is E, so O is in 1 or 5.

That leaves the pattern:

Possible slots:
1: O or ?
2: unknown (but not A, S, V, R, O, E)
3: R or ?
4: E
5: R or O (but not both, since each letter appears once per word in Wordle rules).

Since we still have two unknown letters, we want a word that
- locks in one of the two possible positions for O and R,
- introduces two new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet,
- avoids the already-excluded letters.

Try:
O in position 1, R in position 3, two new consonants in 2 and 5, and E already in 4.

A 5-letter word that matches these constraints is “ORDER”.

Check constraints:
- Letters used: O, R, D, E, R  
- E is in 4 ✓  
- R is in 3 (allowed; not 2 or 1) ✓  
- O is in 1 (allowed; not 2 or 3) ✓  
- D is new and common  
- Second R appears in 5, testing whether the word ends with R.

This guess should give us clear feedback on whether R is in 3 or 5 and where O must sit.

Now we have solid information:

1. E is fixed in position 4.
2. O is fixed in position 1 (✓ in ORDER).
3. D is fixed in position 3 (✓ in ORDER).
4. The word has two R’s, and we know the second R appears in position 5 (✓ in ORDER).
5. The remaining slot is position 2.

Current confirmed pattern: O _ D E R

We just need a 5-letter word that fits O _ D E R. The only common English word matching that pattern is “OLDER”.

Check: O L D E R
- O ✓ in 1
- L new letter in 2
- D ✓ in 3
- E ✓ in 4
- R ✓ in 5

This satisfies all constraints and is a valid word.
