My first goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most commonly used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A well-known and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, and E. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away, whether they're in the correct position or not. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first guess to gather information about the presence of these high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- S is in the word but not at position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in 3rd position, S is not in 4th, and E is not in 5th.

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Does NOT contain A or R
- Does not place O in position 3, S in position 4, or E in position 5

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for. Good next-step words often spread the letters around. A common approach is to pick a word that also introduces new letters while satisfying the constraints.

We now have two full rounds of feedback.

Round 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
Interpretation:  
- The word does NOT contain A or R.  
- It DOES contain O, S, E, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in AROSE.

O(-) P(-) E(-) N(x) S(-)  
Interpretation:  
- N is NOT in the word.  
- O is not in position 1.  
- P is not in position 2.  
- E is not in position 3.  
- S is not in position 5.

Additional facts we now know for sure  
Letters that are IN the word: { O, S, E }  
Letters that are NOT in the word: { A, R, N }  
Positions ruled out for each of O, S, E:

Pos 1: O is not here.  
Pos 2: P is not here (but P itself is still allowed).  
Pos 3: E is not here.  
Pos 4: S is not here.  
Pos 5: E is not here (from AROSE) and S is not here (from OPENS).

Let’s list the 5 positions and the constraints:

O ✗   ?   ?   ?   ?   (O can be in 2,4,5)
S   ?   ?   ?   ✗   ✗   (S can be in 1,2,3)
E   ?   ?   ✗   ?   ✗   (E can be in 1,2,4)
Letters still allowed: all but A,R,N.

We need a word that:
- Uses each of O, S, E exactly once.
- Satisfies all the positional bans above.
- Does not use A,R,N.

A quick way to generate candidates is to try permutations of {O,S,E} plus two new letters from the remaining set {B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

After scanning, one promising candidate that satisfies every single restriction:

STOVE
- Letters used: S,T,O,V,E – contains the required O,S,E.
- Position checks:
  1: S – allowed (S not banned here)
  2: T – allowed
  3: O – allowed (only E is banned here)
  4: V – allowed
  5: E – allowed (E is not banned here; only S is banned at 5)

No duplicates of the mandatory letters, and no forbidden letters (A,R,N) appear.

So STOVE is a valid next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,pesto,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>My first goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most commonly used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A well-known and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, and E. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away, whether they're in the correct position or not. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first guess to gather information about the presence of these high-frequency letters.

- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- S is in the word but not at position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in 3rd position, S is not in 4th, and E is not in 5th.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or R
- Does not place O in position 3, S in position 4, or E in position 5

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for. Good next-step words often spread the letters around. A common approach is to pick a word that also introduces new letters while satisfying the constraints.

Candidate: POISE  
- Contains P, O, I, S, E  
- Contains O, S, E (satisfying feedback)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed)  
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4 — so this is invalid)

- S is in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: HOSES  
- H, O, S, E, S  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: SHOVE

- O is in position 3 (invalid per feedback)

Candidate: SCOPE  
- S, C, O, P, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: CLOSE  
- C, L, O, S, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: LOUSE  
- L, O, U, S, E  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: MOUSE  
- M, O, U, S, E  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: OUSTS  
- O, U, S, T, S  
- S in position 4 and 5 (invalid)

Candidate: OCEAN  
- contains A (invalid)

Candidate: SHONE  
- S, H, O, N, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: SHELF  
- lacks O (invalid)

Candidate: SPIKE  
- lacks O (invalid)

Candidate: EXISTS  
- too long

Candidate: ELOPS  
- E, L, O, P, S  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: EPOSE  
- E, P, O, S, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: OPENS  
- O, P, E, N, S  
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- S in position 5 (allowed)  
- E in position 3 (allowed)  
- No A or R  
This seems valid!

Let’s check:
- Contains O, S, E (yes)
- S is in position 5 (not 4 — allowed)
- E is in position 3 (not 5 — allowed)
- O is in position 1 (not 3 — allowed)
- No A or R

Thus OPENS is a valid candidate.

We need a word that:

- Satisfies all the positional bans above.
- Does not use A,R,N.

A quick way to generate candidates is to try permutations of {O,S,E} plus two new letters from the remaining set {B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Interpretation:
- V is NOT in the word.
- S is not in position 1.
- T is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Recap of all constraints so far:

Letters that are IN the word: {O, S, E} (each exactly once)
Letters that are NOT in the word: {A, R, N, V}

Forbidden positions:
- S cannot be in pos 1 (from STOVE) or pos 4 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from OPENS)
  → S must be in pos 2 or 3
- E cannot be in pos 3 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from STOVE)
  → E must be in pos 1, 2, or 4
- O cannot be in pos 1 (from OPENS) or pos 3 (from STOVE)
  → O must be in pos 2, 4, or 5

We need to arrange O, S, E in three of the five positions, satisfying these bans, and fill the other two slots with letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z}

Let’s systematically check possible placements of O, S, E.

Case 1: S in pos 2
Then E must be in pos 1 or 4 (cannot be 3,5), and O in pos 4 or 5 (cannot be 1,3).
Subcases:
a) S=2, E=1, O=4 → word pattern: E S _ O _
   Fill pos 3 and 5 with any allowed letters, no repeats.
   Example: E S B O D
b) S=2, E=1, O=5 → E S _ _ O
   Example: E S C H O
c) S=2, E=4, O=5 → _ S _ E O
   Example: B S D E O

Case 2: S in pos 3
Then E must be in pos 1,2, or 4 (cannot be 3,5), and O in pos 2,4, or 5 (cannot be 1,3).
Subcases:
a) S=3, E=1, O=2 → E O S _ _
   Example: E O S C H
b) S=3, E=1, O=4 → E _ S O _
   Example: E D S O F
c) S=3, E=1, O=5 → E _ S _ O
   Example: E F S C O
d) S=3, E=2, O=4 → _ E S O _
   Example: C E S O D
e) S=3, E=2, O=5 → _ E S _ O
   Example: F E S D O
f) S=3, E=4, O=2 → _ O S E _
   Example: C O S E D
g) S=3, E=4, O=5 → _ _ S E O
   Example: D F S E O

We need a valid English 5-letter word that matches any of these patterns and uses each of O,S,E exactly once.

Looking through the patterns, one valid English word is:

- Case 2f: _ O S E _ → COSED (not a word)
- Case 2f: _ O S E _ → DOSED (yes, ""DOSED"" is a valid word)

Check DOSED:
- Letters: D, O, S, E, D → D is repeated, which is allowed, but we only need one each of O,S,E
- Positions:
  1: D (allowed)
  2: O (allowed, not pos 1 or 3)
  3: S (allowed, not pos 1,4,5)
  4: E (allowed, not pos 3,5)
  5: D (allowed)
- Contains O,S,E exactly once each
- No forbidden letters (A,R,N,V)

Another candidate from Case 1a: E S B O D (not a word)

Another candidate from Case 2d: C E S O D (not a word)

Another valid word from Case 2f: MOSED (not a word)

Another pattern: _ O _ E S is invalid (S in pos 5 is banned)

Another pattern: _ _ O S E → example: B O U S E (not matching)

After careful review, ""DOSED"" fits all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,pesto,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>My first goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most commonly used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A well-known and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, and E. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away, whether they're in the correct position or not. 

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first guess to gather information about the presence of these high-frequency letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not at position 3 (-).
- S is in the word but not at position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains O, S, and E, but none of R or A.
- O is not in 3rd position, S is not in 4th, and E is not in 5th.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or R
- Does not place O in position 3, S in position 4, or E in position 5

Let’s try to place O, S, and E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for. Good next-step words often spread the letters around. A common approach is to pick a word that also introduces new letters while satisfying the constraints.

Candidate: POISE  
- Contains P, O, I, S, E  
- Contains O, S, E (satisfying feedback)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed)  
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4 — so this is invalid)

Candidate: NOISE  
- N, O, I, S, E  
- S is in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: HOSES  
- H, O, S, E, S  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: SHOVE  
- S, H, O, V, E  
- O is in position 3 (invalid per feedback)

Candidate: DOSES  
- D, O, S, E, S  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: STONE  
- S, T, O, N, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: STOLE  
- S, T, O, L, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: STORE  
- S, T, O, R, E — contains R (invalid)

Candidate: SOBER  
- S, O, B, E, R — contains R (invalid)

Candidate: SPOKE  
- S, P, O, K, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: SCOPE  
- S, C, O, P, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: CLOSE  
- C, L, O, S, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: LOUSE  
- L, O, U, S, E  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: MOUSE  
- M, O, U, S, E  
- S in position 4 (invalid)

Candidate: OUSTS  
- O, U, S, T, S  
- S in position 4 and 5 (invalid)

Candidate: OCEAN  
- contains A (invalid)

Candidate: SHONE  
- S, H, O, N, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: SHELF  
- lacks O (invalid)

Candidate: SPIKE  
- lacks O (invalid)

Candidate: EXISTS  
- too long

Candidate: ELOPS  
- E, L, O, P, S  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: EPOSE  
- E, P, O, S, E  
- O in position 3 (invalid)

Candidate: OPENS  
- O, P, E, N, S  
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- S in position 5 (allowed)  
- E in position 3 (allowed)  
- No A or R  
This seems valid!

Let’s check:
- Contains O, S, E (yes)
- S is in position 5 (not 4 — allowed)
- E is in position 3 (not 5 — allowed)
- O is in position 1 (not 3 — allowed)
- No A or R

Thus OPENS is a valid candidate.

Guess 2: OPENS -> FEEDBACK: O(-) P(-) E(-) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two full rounds of feedback.

Round 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
Interpretation:  
- The word does NOT contain A or R.  
- It DOES contain O, S, E, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in AROSE.

Round 2: OPENS  
O(-) P(-) E(-) N(x) S(-)  
Interpretation:  
- N is NOT in the word.  
- O is not in position 1.  
- P is not in position 2.  
- E is not in position 3.  
- S is not in position 5.

Additional facts we now know for sure  
Letters that are IN the word: { O, S, E }  
Letters that are NOT in the word: { A, R, N }  
Positions ruled out for each of O, S, E:

Pos 1: O is not here.  
Pos 2: P is not here (but P itself is still allowed).  
Pos 3: E is not here.  
Pos 4: S is not here.  
Pos 5: E is not here (from AROSE) and S is not here (from OPENS).

Let’s list the 5 positions and the constraints:

1 2 3 4 5
----------------
O ✗   ?   ?   ?   ?   (O can be in 2,4,5)
S   ?   ?   ?   ✗   ✗   (S can be in 1,2,3)
E   ?   ?   ✗   ?   ✗   (E can be in 1,2,4)
Letters still allowed: all but A,R,N.

We need a word that:
- Uses each of O, S, E exactly once.
- Satisfies all the positional bans above.
- Does not use A,R,N.

A quick way to generate candidates is to try permutations of {O,S,E} plus two new letters from the remaining set {B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

After scanning, one promising candidate that satisfies every single restriction:

STOVE
- Letters used: S,T,O,V,E – contains the required O,S,E.
- Position checks:
  1: S – allowed (S not banned here)
  2: T – allowed
  3: O – allowed (only E is banned here)
  4: V – allowed
  5: E – allowed (E is not banned here; only S is banned at 5)

No duplicates of the mandatory letters, and no forbidden letters (A,R,N) appear.

So STOVE is a valid next guess.

Recap of all constraints so far:

Letters that are IN the word: {O, S, E} (each exactly once)
Letters that are NOT in the word: {A, R, N, V}

Forbidden positions:
- S cannot be in pos 1 (from STOVE) or pos 4 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from OPENS)
  → S must be in pos 2 or 3
- E cannot be in pos 3 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from AROSE) or pos 5 (from STOVE)
  → E must be in pos 1, 2, or 4
- O cannot be in pos 1 (from OPENS) or pos 3 (from STOVE)
  → O must be in pos 2, 4, or 5

We need to arrange O, S, E in three of the five positions, satisfying these bans, and fill the other two slots with letters from the remaining allowed set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z}

Let’s systematically check possible placements of O, S, E.

Case 1: S in pos 2
Then E must be in pos 1 or 4 (cannot be 3,5), and O in pos 4 or 5 (cannot be 1,3).
Subcases:
a) S=2, E=1, O=4 → word pattern: E S _ O _
   Fill pos 3 and 5 with any allowed letters, no repeats.
   Example: E S B O D
b) S=2, E=1, O=5 → E S _ _ O
   Example: E S C H O
c) S=2, E=4, O=5 → _ S _ E O
   Example: B S D E O

Case 2: S in pos 3
Then E must be in pos 1,2, or 4 (cannot be 3,5), and O in pos 2,4, or 5 (cannot be 1,3).
Subcases:
a) S=3, E=1, O=2 → E O S _ _
   Example: E O S C H
b) S=3, E=1, O=4 → E _ S O _
   Example: E D S O F
c) S=3, E=1, O=5 → E _ S _ O
   Example: E F S C O
d) S=3, E=2, O=4 → _ E S O _
   Example: C E S O D
e) S=3, E=2, O=5 → _ E S _ O
   Example: F E S D O
f) S=3, E=4, O=2 → _ O S E _
   Example: C O S E D
g) S=3, E=4, O=5 → _ _ S E O
   Example: D F S E O

We need a valid English 5-letter word that matches any of these patterns and uses each of O,S,E exactly once.

Looking through the patterns, one valid English word is:

- Case 2f: _ O S E _ → COSED (not a word)
- Case 2f: _ O S E _ → DOSED (yes, ""DOSED"" is a valid word)

Check DOSED:
- Letters: D, O, S, E, D → D is repeated, which is allowed, but we only need one each of O,S,E
- Positions:
  1: D (allowed)
  2: O (allowed, not pos 1 or 3)
  3: S (allowed, not pos 1,4,5)
  4: E (allowed, not pos 3,5)
  5: D (allowed)
- Contains O,S,E exactly once each
- No forbidden letters (A,R,N,V)

Another candidate from Case 1a: E S B O D (not a word)

Another candidate from Case 2d: C E S O D (not a word)

Another valid word from Case 2f: MOSED (not a word)

Another pattern: _ O _ E S is invalid (S in pos 5 is banned)

Another pattern: _ _ O S E → example: B O U S E (not matching)

After careful review, ""DOSED"" fits all constraints.

From DOSED:

D(x)  – D is not in the word at all  
O(-)  – O is in the word, but not in position 2  
S(✓)  – S is in the word AND correctly placed at position 3  
E(-)  – E is in the word, but not in position 4  
D(x)  – second D is also not in the word  

So we now know:

Letters that are IN the word (exactly once each):  
O, S(✓ at 3), E

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, R, N, V, D

Forbidden positions so far:
1 – cannot be A, R, N, V, D (but they’re already excluded)  
2 – cannot be O (from DOSED), P (from OPENS), T (from STOVE)  
3 – must be S (fixed)  
4 – cannot be E, D  
5 – cannot be E, S (from AROSE / OPENS)

Thus the skeleton is:
_ _ S _ _  
with O and E still to be placed, and two new letters to fill the remaining slots.

Available positions for O and E: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Restrictions:
- O cannot be in position 2 (from DOSED)  
- E cannot be in position 4 or 5  
Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2, and O can be in any remaining allowed slot.

Let’s enumerate valid placements:

Case 1: E in 1  
Then O must go in 2, 4, or 5  
BUT position 2 cannot be O (from DOSED) and also cannot be P or T (already ruled out).  
So O can be in 4 or 5, and we need two new letters for the other two empty slots.

Skeletons:
E _ S O _  
E _ S _ O  

We must pick letters from the allowed set {B,C,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z} (no repeats).

Valid English words among these patterns:

- E _ S O _ → “ESOUR” (not a word)  
- E _ S _ O → “ESCOT” (not standard) … none found.

Case 2: E in 2  
Then O cannot be at 2 (already), and cannot be at 3 (fixed S).  
So O can be at 1, 4, or 5.  
Skeletons:
O E S _ _   (but O at 1 is allowed, E at 2 allowed)  
_ E S O _   (need a letter for position 1)  
_ E S _ O   (need a letter for position 1)

   OES** is not a word.

2. _ E S O _  
   Try B E S O W → “BESOW” (not a word)

   G E S T O is valid English (“GESTO” – variant, but not common).  
   Try F E S T O – “FESTO” – also variant.

Actually, we overlooked a legitimate word:  _ E S _ O with a different letter.

Try H E S T O – “HESTO” – no.

Use M E S T O → “MESTO” (musical term) – acceptable.  

But let’s search systematically for common words.

Another pattern: O at 5  
Skeleton: _ E S _ O  
We need a 5-letter English word of form ? E S ? O  

A quick scan yields:

- GESHO (no)  
- KESMO (no)  
- LESHO (no)  

Wait – the pattern _ E S _ O with allowed letters:

Choose position 1 and 4 from the remaining letters {B,C,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z} and must form an English word.

Try:  
B E S I O – “BESIO” (no)  
F E S I O – “FESIO” (no)  
G E S I O – “GESIO” (no)

T E S T O – contains T (forbidden at 2) but T is at 4 – allowed?  
No, T is only forbidden at 2, so T at 4 is allowed.  
“TESTO” (not standard)  

Another check: _ E S _ O  
Try: P E S T O – P is allowed (P only banned at 2).  
P E S T O → “PESTO” – YES, a valid English word.

Verify constraints for PESTO:

P – not forbidden (only banned at 2, here it is at 1)  
E – at 2 (allowed)  
S – at 3 (correct)  
T – at 4 (T is only banned at 2, so OK)  
O – at 5 (allowed for O)  

And it contains exactly O,S,E once each, no forbidden letters.

Perfect.
