For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequently used letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The secret word contains the letter T, but NOT in position 4.
- Letters S, L, A, E are excluded entirely.

Good letters to test next: vowels O, I, U and consonants R, N, C, H, B, etc. A word that tests several new letters while keeping T somewhere else is ideal.

A strong choice: “NORTH”
- N: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- R: new consonant
- T: already confirmed to be in the word, now placed in position 3
- H: new consonant

This guess uses five entirely new letters (none of the already-eliminated S, L, A, E) and shifts T to a new spot.

From the two guesses so far we have:

1. SLATE → S ✗, L ✗, A ✗, T (exists, wrong spot), E ✗
2. NORTH → N (exists, wrong spot), O (exists, wrong spot), R ✗, T (exists, wrong spot again), H (exists, wrong spot)

Letters that have been eliminated entirely:
- S, L, A, E, R

Letters that are confirmed to be in the word:
- T, N, O, H   (all marked “in word but wrong position”)

Known positions:
- T is **NOT** in spots 3 or 4.
- N is **NOT** in spot 1.
- O is **NOT** in spot 2.
- H is **NOT** in spot 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains all of T, N, O, H and one more letter that hasn’t been tried yet (and isn’t S, L, A, E, R).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “THONG”.
- It contains T, H, O, N, G (G hasn’t been used before).
- T is in spot 1 (never ruled out).
- H is in spot 2 (never ruled out).
- O is in spot 3 (never ruled out).
- N is in spot 4 (never ruled out).
- G is new.

This placement tests new positions for T, H, O, N while introducing a fresh letter G.
