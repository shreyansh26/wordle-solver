Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. The best opening words in Wordle typically use common letters and provide good coverage of vowels and consonants. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels but not great consonants)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered an optimal starting word because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good information about multiple common consonants and a common vowel.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ N _

Next I need to:
1. Avoid C, R, A, E
2. Make sure N is in the 4th position
3. Use new common letters to maximize information

Good consonants left to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U

I want to test several new letters quickly. A word like STONY would cover S, T, O, Y (but Y is less common). A better choice might be SLING - but G is less common too.

Let's try STONY:
- S, T, O, N, Y
- N is confirmed in 4th position
- Tests S, T, O, Y (all new letters not eliminated)

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)  
   – Pattern so far: _ _ _ N _

2. STONY → S(✓) T(-) O(x) N(✓) Y(x)  
   – Pattern so far: S _ _ N _
   – T is in the word but in the wrong position
   – O and Y are not in the word; C, R, A, E already ruled out

The word must:
- Start with S
- Have N in 4th place
- Contain T somewhere, but not in 3rd place (since STONY had T in 2nd and it was marked “-”)

Possible positions for T: 3rd or 5th (2nd is already excluded by the feedback).

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit:
S _ _ N _
with T appearing once more and no other letters from {C,R,A,E,O,Y}.

Trying T in 3rd place: S _ T N _  
Trying T in 5th place: S _ _ N T

Common words that fit:
- SUINT (but U and I are untested, and T would be 5th)
- STINT (T is 2nd and 4th, but N already fixed at 4th – invalid)
- SPENT (P, E, N, T – but E is ruled out)
- SLANT (L, A, N, T – A ruled out)
- SWUNT (rare)
- STUNT (T would be 2nd and 5th, but 2nd T was already “-”, so 5th is possible)

Actually STUNT is invalid because T appears twice and the feedback only indicated one T.

A better fit is SPINT? No, that’s not a word.

Let’s try S U I N T. That’s SUINT – a valid word meaning a solution of alkaloids, though it’s uncommon.

Another check: S P I N T – SPINT isn’t valid.

S H I N T – SHINT isn’t a standard word.

S L I N T – SLINT isn’t valid.

S P U N T – SPUNT is archaic.

S W I N T – SWINT isn’t valid.

S M I N T – SMINT isn’t valid.

S V I N T – no.

S F I N T – no.

S D I N T – DINT is valid, but we need 5 letters starting with S.

Wait, let me re-examine. The only remaining common letters left are:  
Allowed letters: S, T, N fixed, plus new ones not yet used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Avoiding C, R, A, E, O, Y.

The pattern is S _ _ N _.  
T must be in 3rd or 5th.

A very plausible word with T in 5th place is:

S _ _ N T → S P I N T is invalid  
S L I N T invalid  
S U I N T valid but rare  
Another: S H I N T invalid  
S B I N T invalid  
S K I N T invalid  

Actually, the best candidate seems to be S U I N T, but it’s uncommon. However, it fits all constraints.

Another check: S P U N T – SPUNT is archaic but listed in some dictionaries as past tense of “spend”. Not ideal.

Is there a more common word? Let’s try T in 3rd place:

S _ T N _ → S P T N _ no  
S L T N _ no  
S H T N _ no  
S M T N _ no  
S W T N _ no  

No common words.

Hence the only remaining plausible word fitting all constraints is SUINT (even though it’s uncommon) or S P U N T.

But let’s think differently: maybe T is in 2nd place but feedback said it’s in wrong position (so it can’t be 2nd). Therefore T must be 3rd or 5th.

The common word that fits S _ _ N T is:

S P I N T – invalid  
S L I N T – invalid  
S H I N T – invalid  
S B I N T – invalid  

In fact, the only common word is S U I N T, but that’s rare. Let me check if there’s another.

Wait – what about S T I N G? Nope, N isn’t 4th.

Actually, another thought: T could be in 3rd place.

Pattern: S _ T N _  
Possible: S H T N _ no  
S M T N _ no  
S P T N _ no  

No common words.

The only remaining possible is S U I N T, but since it’s obscure, I need to reassess.

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words matching S _ _ N _ with T included somewhere else and avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: C, R, A, E, O, Y  
Known: S _ _ N _  
Must include T somewhere else.

Possible positions for T:  
- 3rd: S _ T N _  
   Examples: S H T N _ none  
- 5th: S _ _ N T  
   Examples: S P I N T invalid  
   S U I N T valid  
   S L I N T invalid  
   S K I N T invalid  

Thus, the only valid word seems to be S U I N T.

However, another candidate arises if I allow T in 3rd: S P T N _ no  
Actually, S M I N T is invalid.

Upon deeper reflection, the word **SUING** (S U I N G) fits S _ _ N _ but lacks T – no good.

Another check: S P I N T invalid  
S L I N T invalid  

It appears the only valid word fitting all constraints is **SUINT** (S U I N T), even if uncommon.

But let me verify one last time: is there a common word S _ _ N T? Yes – **SQUINT** is 6 letters. No 5-letter common word.

Wait, another candidate: **STING** – but N isn’t 4th.

At this point, the only valid 5-letter word matching all feedback is **SUINT**.

Therefore, I will guess **SUINT** as the next word.

Therefore, I will guess **SUINT** as the next word.",Guess 3: SUINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) I(x) N(✓) T(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,SHUNT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best opening words in Wordle typically use common letters and provide good coverage of vowels and consonants. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels but not great consonants)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered an optimal starting word because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good information about multiple common consonants and a common vowel.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ N _

Next I need to:
1. Avoid C, R, A, E
2. Make sure N is in the 4th position
3. Use new common letters to maximize information

Good consonants left to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U

I want to test several new letters quickly. A word like STONY would cover S, T, O, Y (but Y is less common). A better choice might be SLING - but G is less common too.

Let's try STONY:
- S, T, O, N, Y
- N is confirmed in 4th position
- Tests S, T, O, Y (all new letters not eliminated)

This seems like a strong second guess.

<guess>STONY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(x) N(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)  
   – Pattern so far: _ _ _ N _

2. STONY → S(✓) T(-) O(x) N(✓) Y(x)  
   – Pattern so far: S _ _ N _
   – T is in the word but in the wrong position
   – O and Y are not in the word; C, R, A, E already ruled out

The word must:
- Start with S
- Have N in 4th place
- Contain T somewhere, but not in 3rd place (since STONY had T in 2nd and it was marked “-”)

Possible positions for T: 3rd or 5th (2nd is already excluded by the feedback).

Let’s look for 5-letter words that fit:
S _ _ N _
with T appearing once more and no other letters from {C,R,A,E,O,Y}.

Trying T in 3rd place: S _ T N _  
Trying T in 5th place: S _ _ N T

Common words that fit:
- SUINT (but U and I are untested, and T would be 5th)
- STINT (T is 2nd and 4th, but N already fixed at 4th – invalid)
- SPENT (P, E, N, T – but E is ruled out)
- SLANT (L, A, N, T – A ruled out)
- SWUNT (rare)
- STUNT (T would be 2nd and 5th, but 2nd T was already “-”, so 5th is possible)

Actually STUNT is invalid because T appears twice and the feedback only indicated one T.

A better fit is SPINT? No, that’s not a word.

Let’s try S U I N T. That’s SUINT – a valid word meaning a solution of alkaloids, though it’s uncommon.

Another check: S P I N T – SPINT isn’t valid.

S H I N T – SHINT isn’t a standard word.

S L I N T – SLINT isn’t valid.

S P U N T – SPUNT is archaic.

S W I N T – SWINT isn’t valid.

S M I N T – SMINT isn’t valid.

S V I N T – no.

S F I N T – no.

S D I N T – DINT is valid, but we need 5 letters starting with S.

Wait, let me re-examine. The only remaining common letters left are:  
Allowed letters: S, T, N fixed, plus new ones not yet used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Avoiding C, R, A, E, O, Y.

The pattern is S _ _ N _.  
T must be in 3rd or 5th.

A very plausible word with T in 5th place is:

S _ _ N T → S P I N T is invalid  
S L I N T invalid  
S U I N T valid but rare  
Another: S H I N T invalid  
S B I N T invalid  
S K I N T invalid  

Actually, the best candidate seems to be S U I N T, but it’s uncommon. However, it fits all constraints.

Another check: S P U N T – SPUNT is archaic but listed in some dictionaries as past tense of “spend”. Not ideal.

Is there a more common word? Let’s try T in 3rd place:

S _ T N _ → S P T N _ no  
S L T N _ no  
S H T N _ no  
S M T N _ no  
S W T N _ no  

No common words.

Hence the only remaining plausible word fitting all constraints is SUINT (even though it’s uncommon) or S P U N T.

But let’s think differently: maybe T is in 2nd place but feedback said it’s in wrong position (so it can’t be 2nd). Therefore T must be 3rd or 5th.

The common word that fits S _ _ N T is:

S P I N T – invalid  
S L I N T – invalid  
S H I N T – invalid  
S B I N T – invalid  

In fact, the only common word is S U I N T, but that’s rare. Let me check if there’s another.

Wait – what about S T I N G? Nope, N isn’t 4th.

Actually, another thought: T could be in 3rd place.

Pattern: S _ T N _  
Possible: S H T N _ no  
S M T N _ no  
S P T N _ no  

No common words.

The only remaining possible is S U I N T, but since it’s obscure, I need to reassess.

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words matching S _ _ N _ with T included somewhere else and avoiding banned letters.

Banned letters: C, R, A, E, O, Y  
Known: S _ _ N _  
Must include T somewhere else.

Possible positions for T:  
- 3rd: S _ T N _  
   Examples: S H T N _ none  
- 5th: S _ _ N T  
   Examples: S P I N T invalid  
   S U I N T valid  
   S L I N T invalid  
   S K I N T invalid  

Thus, the only valid word seems to be S U I N T.

However, another candidate arises if I allow T in 3rd: S P T N _ no  
Actually, S M I N T is invalid.

Upon deeper reflection, the word **SUING** (S U I N G) fits S _ _ N _ but lacks T – no good.

Another check: S P I N T invalid  
S L I N T invalid  

It appears the only valid word fitting all constraints is **SUINT** (S U I N T), even if uncommon.

But let me verify one last time: is there a common word S _ _ N T? Yes – **SQUINT** is 6 letters. No 5-letter common word.

Wait, another candidate: **STING** – but N isn’t 4th.

At this point, the only valid 5-letter word matching all feedback is **SUINT**.

Therefore, I will guess **SUINT** as the next word.

From all the feedback so far we know:

- Pattern: S _ _ N T
- Letters definitely used and in position: S(1st), N(4th), T(5th)
- Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong positions: U (because it received “-” in 2nd place, so it must appear elsewhere)
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, E, O, Y, I

Hence the missing second and third letters must:
- Come from the remaining alphabet {B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}
- Include the letter U somewhere among them (since U must appear at least once)

So the word looks like: S _ U N T  or  S U _ N T

The second pattern (S U _ N T) seems more promising because it places U in 2nd place (but feedback said U is in word but “wrong place” in that exact spot – so U must be elsewhere). Therefore U must be in 3rd position.

So the only possible pattern left is: S _ U N T

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word with letters S, _, U, N, T.

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for a common word:  
- S B U N T – “shunt” is 5 letters but spelled S H U N T.

Checking spelling: S H U N T is a real English word meaning to divert or switch tracks.

All letters S, H, U, N, T fit the constraints:
- S(✓) 1st

- U must appear (now in 3rd)  
- N(✓) 4th

No conflicts with any previous negatives.
