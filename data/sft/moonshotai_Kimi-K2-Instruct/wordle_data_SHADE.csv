For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A popular first guess among Wordle players is ""SLATE"" because it contains several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Another good option is ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage.

From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓)

So far we know:
1. The last letter is E (fixed).
2. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or I.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both A and S somewhere else, and avoiding R and I.

Possible patterns:
- The A could be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2)
- The S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Good candidate words to test:
- ""LEASE"" (but the S is in position 4 which was marked wrong)
- ""CHASE"" (but has C, H which are less common)
- ""ASKEE"" (but uses double E and K which might be less helpful)
- ""BASEE"" (but double E again)
- ""SABLE"" (but ends in E, has S and A, and avoids R/I)

Actually ""SABLE"" fits all requirements:
- Ends with E
- Contains S and A (S in position 1, A in position 3 - neither is in the positions ruled out)
- Does not contain R or I

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A popular first guess among Wordle players is ""SLATE"" because it contains several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Another good option is ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓)

So far we know:
1. The last letter is E (fixed).
2. The word contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or I.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both A and S somewhere else, and avoiding R and I.

Possible patterns:
- The A could be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2)
- The S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Good candidate words to test:
- ""LEASE"" (but the S is in position 4 which was marked wrong)
- ""CHASE"" (but has C, H which are less common)
- ""ASKEE"" (but uses double E and K which might be less helpful)
- ""BASEE"" (but double E again)
- ""SABLE"" (but ends in E, has S and A, and avoids R/I)

Actually ""SABLE"" fits all requirements:
- Ends with E
- Contains S and A (S in position 1, A in position 3 - neither is in the positions ruled out)
- Does not contain R or I

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R and I are absent.

2. SABLE → S(✓) A(-) B(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - S is now confirmed in position 1.
   - E remains in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (because in SABLE it was in position 2 and still marked “-”).

So:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Must contain A in either position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 1, 2, or 5).
- Cannot contain B, L, R, I.

Possible letters left for positions 2, 3, 4: consonants and vowels excluding the banned ones.

Position 3 or 4 must be A. Let’s list candidates:

Case 1: A in position 3 → S _ A _ E
   – Possible: SPACE, STAGE, SHADE, SHAKE, SCALE, SHAME, etc.
   – SPACE has P and C which weren’t tried yet.

Case 2: A in position 4 → S _ _ A E
   – English words ending in AE are rare; only SAKE, SNAKE, STAGE, etc. but they’re not S _ _ A E.
   – Actually common 5-letter words ending in AE are almost nonexistent.

So A is almost certainly in position 3 → pattern S _ A _ E.

We need a consonant for position 2 and another for position 4. We haven’t tried P, C, G, M, D, etc.

Let’s pick SPACE:
- S(✓) P _ A C E – fits S _ A _ E.
- Uses new letters P and C to test their presence.
