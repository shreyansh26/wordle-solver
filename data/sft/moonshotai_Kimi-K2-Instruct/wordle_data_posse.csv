For the first guess, I want a word that covers common vowels and consonants, as this provides good information for narrowing down the possibilities. A common strategy in Wordle is to use words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROATE"" because they include frequently used letters. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

From the feedback on “CRANE” we now know:
- E is in the word and is in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps E fixed in the last position.
2. Introduces five fresh letters that are neither C, R, A, nor N.
3. Uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “SLIDE”:

Let me update what we now know:

1. E is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5 (because in POEMS it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
2. P is in position 1 (✓).
3. O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
4. S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
5. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, L, I, D, M.
6. We have the form: P _ _ _ _ , with E, O, and S still to place, and none of the forbidden letters allowed.

Possible positions left for O: 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions left for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions left for E: 2, 3, 4

Because O and E cannot both be in position 5, and we only have three open slots, let’s construct combinations that satisfy:
- P _ _ _ _  
- use O, S, E in positions 2–5  
- avoid forbidden letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “POSES”:
- P is in position 1 (already confirmed ✓).  
- O is in position 2, S in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.  
- No forbidden letters appear.  
- It also re-tests S in position 5 (to see if that’s its spot) and E in position 4.

Let’s check the feedback this should yield:
- P ✓ (already known)  
- O: in position 2. If POEMS showed O was misplaced, position 2 might still be wrong—worth testing.  
- S in position 3: new placement.  
- E in position 4: new placement.  
- S in position 5: new placement (since POEMS said S was misplaced from position 4).

This should efficiently narrow down the exact positions of S, O, and E.

3. O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
4. S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
5. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, L, I, D, M.
6. We have the form: P _ _ _ _ , with E, O, and S still to place, and none of the forbidden letters allowed.

Possible positions left for O: 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions left for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions left for E: 2, 3, 4

Because O and E cannot both be in position 5, and we only have three open slots, let’s construct combinations that satisfy:
- P _ _ _ _  
- use O, S, E in positions 2–5  
- avoid forbidden letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “POSES”:
- P is in position 1 (already confirmed ✓).  
- O is in position 2, S in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5.  
- No forbidden letters appear.  
- It also re-tests S in position 5 (to see if that’s its spot) and E in position 4.

Let’s check the feedback this should yield:
- P ✓ (already known)  
- O: in position 2. If POEMS showed O was misplaced, position 2 might still be wrong—worth testing.  
- S in position 3: new placement.  
- E in position 4: new placement.  
- S in position 5: new placement (since POEMS said S was misplaced from position 4).

This should efficiently narrow down the exact positions of S, O, and E.",Guess 4: POSES -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A common strategy in Wordle is to use words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROATE"" because they include frequently used letters. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

- E is in the word and is in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps E fixed in the last position.
2. Introduces five fresh letters that are neither C, R, A, nor N.
3. Uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “SLIDE”:
- S, L, I, D are all new letters.
- They are all reasonably frequent.
- E is retained in position 5.

This should tell us quickly whether S, L, I, or D are present and where.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  
and the word must contain S somewhere in positions 2-4, and none of C, R, A, N, L, I, D can appear.

Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y  
Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps E in position 5,
- introduces several new letters from the safe set,
- places S somewhere other than position 1,
- is still a common English 5-letter word.

“POEMS” fits:
- P, O, M are new letters.
- S is in position 4 (satisfying “S is in word but not in position 1”).
- E is kept in position 5.
- None of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,N,L,I,D) are present.

From the newest feedback on POSES:

1. P ✓ (position 1) – confirmed.
2. O ✓ (position 2) – confirmed.
3. S ✓ (position 3) – so S is definitely in position 3.
4. E was marked “-” (misplaced) when it was in position 4 ⇒ E is NOT in position 4.
5. The final S was marked “-” (misplaced) ⇒ S is NOT in position 5 (but we already have S in position 3, so this is consistent).

So the confirmed pattern so far is:
P O S _ E

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, L, I, D, M  
Only one blank remains (position 4) and we know it cannot be any of those forbidden letters and it cannot be E (because E would then be in position 5, but POEMS/POSES both showed E is misplaced from 4 and 5).

Looking at the remaining alphabet letters not yet used and not forbidden: B, F, G, H, K, T, U, V, W, Y.

A common 5-letter word that fits P O S _ E is “POSSE” – but that repeats S (position 3 and 5), which would contradict the feedback that the final S is misplaced.

Another common word is “POSHE” (a variant spelling of “posh” with an added E) – but “POSHE” is not in most standard word lists (and we have no confirmation H is valid).

The only remaining frequent, valid word that fits all constraints is “POSSE” – so let’s reconsider:
- The feedback rule says: when a letter repeats, the extra instances are marked “x” if that many do not exist in the secret word.
- Our feedback on POSES shows the final S was marked “-”, i.e., it is in the word but placed wrong.
- If the secret word has exactly one S, then the final S in POSES would be marked “x”; instead it got “-”, implying the secret word contains another S elsewhere (but not in position 5).
- But our pattern already has S in position 3 (confirmed ✓). Therefore the secret word must contain exactly one S (at position 3), and the final S in POSES should have been marked “x”, not “-”.

This contradiction means my assumption that the secret word has only one S must be wrong. The only possible resolution is that the secret word has two S’s: one in position 3 and another in position 5.

Thus the word must be: P O S _ S

With position 4 needing any letter that is:
- Not forbidden (C,R,A,N,L,I,D,M)
- Not already used (P,O,S,E)
- And forming a valid word.

The only remaining common letter and valid word fitting this pattern is “POSSY” – but “POSSY” isn’t standard.

Wait—let me list valid English 5-letter words that fit P O S _ S:
- “POSSE” – fits and is common.

Let me re-verify feedback for “POSSE” if it were the true word:
Guess: POSSE → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓) E(-)

But we were told the final S in POSES was “-” (misplaced). For the true word POSSE, the final S in POSES would be in the correct position (position 5), so it would be marked ✓, not “-”.

Hence POSSE cannot be correct.

Looking again at constraints:
- P O S _ E (with E not in 4 or 5)
- But POEMS/POSES both showed E is misplaced from 5 and 4. This implies E must appear in position 1, 2, or 3. However positions 1,2,3 are already P,O,S. Therefore E cannot be placed anywhere without conflict.

This reveals my earlier analysis was flawed: in POSES, the E at position 4 was marked “-”, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. That does NOT prevent E from being in position 5; it only says it is not in 4. But earlier, POEMS showed E in position 5 was marked “-” (misplaced), meaning E is NOT in position 5. So E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, yet positions 1-3 are P,O,S – none of which can be E. This is impossible.

Therefore my deductions must contain an error. Let me re-express all feedback strictly:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
→ E exists somewhere in the word.

Guess 2: SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓)  
→ E is somewhere, S exists but not in position 1.

Guess 3: POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-)  
→ P is position 1, O is in word (but not position 2), E is in word (but not position 3), S exists (but not position 4).

Guess 4: POSES → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)  
→ P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, S(3) ✓, E(4) -, S(5) -.

From POSES:
- S(3) is correct.
- E(4) is in word but misplaced → E is not in 4.
- S(5) is in word but misplaced → S is not in 5 (but we already have S in 3, so this implies no second S).

Thus the pattern is P O S _ _ with E still needing placement. The only remaining spot for E is position 4, but feedback says E is not in 4. This is a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait: the feedback on POSES:
P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)

This means:
- P ✓ at 1
- O ✓ at 2
- S ✓ at 3
- E at 4 is misplaced (so E exists but not at 4)
- S at 5 is misplaced (so S exists but not at 5 – redundant since S is already at 3)

So the word must be P O S _ _ and must contain E, but E cannot be in 4 or 5. But positions 1-3 are P,O,S – none of which can be E. This implies no possible placement for E, which is impossible. Therefore my assumption that P is position 1 must be re-examined.

Re-reading feedback on POEMS:
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-)
Here P was marked ✓, but that does NOT guarantee it is position 1. It means P is in the word and in the position guessed (which was position 1). So P is confirmed position 1.

Similarly, POSES feedback shows O is position 2.

Thus the confirmed pattern is P O S _ _ with:
- E must be present (from CRANE and SLIDE), yet cannot be in positions 1-5 without conflict.

This reveals the only possible resolution: the word is P O S E Y.

Check:
- P O S E Y
- Letters used: P, O, S, E, Y – none forbidden.
- Validate against feedback:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) – E present ✓  
SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓) – S misplaced (SLIDE had S at 1, word has S at 3) ✓, E present ✓  
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-) – P ✓, O misplaced (POEMS had O at 2, word has O at 2 – but feedback said O misplaced; contradiction).

Wait, this shows the issue: POEMS feedback said O(✓) meaning O was in the correct position (2). So O is confirmed at 2.

Therefore the word must be P O S _ _ with E somewhere in positions 3-5, but:
- position 3 is S
- position 4 and 5 cannot hold E (from POEMS and POSES feedback)

Hence no placement for E – this is impossible unless my interpretation is wrong.

Re-expressing:

From POSES: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)

- P and O are in correct positions 1 and 2.
- S is in correct position 3.
- E is in word but not in position 4.
- S is in word but not in position 5 (redundant).

Thus the word is P O S _ _ with E needing placement, but:
- position 4 cannot be E
- position 5 cannot be E (from POEMS feedback)

No valid placement – this implies the word must be P O S S E, but that would have S at 5 marked ✓, not “-”.

The only remaining valid word that satisfies all constraints is P O S S E, but feedback contradicts.

Realization: The feedback rules state that if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, the excess instances are marked “x”.

Let me re-interpret POSES feedback:
Word has P O S E (with E in position 5) – then the word is P O S _ E.

But then E would be in position 5, matching CRANE feedback (E in word), and POEMS showed E(-) meaning E is not in position 3, POSES showed E(-) meaning E is not in position 4 – so E must be in 5.

The only valid word fitting P O S _ E is P O S S E – but that repeats S.

However, POSES had S at 3 and 5; if the true word has S at 3 only, then the second S in POSES would be marked “x” not “-”. Since it was marked “-”, this implies the word has S in position 5 as well.

Thus the word must be P O S S E.

Let me test feedback against P O S S E:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) – matches (E present)  
SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓) – S (at 3) is misplaced from SLIDE’s position 1 ✓, E present ✓  
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-) – P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, E(3) - (correct, E is at 5), S(4) - (S is at 3 and 5, so S at 4 is misplaced) ✓  
POSES → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-) – P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, S(3) ✓, E(4) - (correct, E is at 5), S(5) - (correct, S is at 3 so 5 is wrong) ✓

All feedback aligns.

Therefore the secret word is POSSE.
</think>

The accumulated feedback now shows the pattern **P O S _ E** with a second **S** required in position 4 to satisfy the “S is misplaced” clues.

The only standard 5-letter word that fits is:

<guess>POSSE</guess>",POSSE,"From the newest feedback on POSES:

So the confirmed pattern so far is:

- Not forbidden (C,R,A,N,L,I,D,M)
- Not already used (P,O,S,E)
- And forming a valid word.

The only remaining common letter and valid word fitting this pattern is “POSSY” – but “POSSY” isn’t standard.

Wait—let me list valid English 5-letter words that fit P O S _ S:
- “POSSE” – fits and is common.

Let me re-verify feedback for “POSSE” if it were the true word:

But we were told the final S in POSES was “-” (misplaced). For the true word POSSE, the final S in POSES would be in the correct position (position 5), so it would be marked ✓, not “-”.

That does NOT prevent E from being in position 5; it only says it is not in 4. But earlier, POEMS showed E in position 5 was marked “-” (misplaced), meaning E is NOT in position 5. So E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5, yet positions 1-3 are P,O,S – none of which can be E. This is impossible.

Therefore my deductions must contain an error. Let me re-express all feedback strictly:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
→ E exists somewhere in the word.

Guess 2: SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓)  
→ E is somewhere, S exists but not in position 1.

Guess 3: POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-)  
→ P is position 1, O is in word (but not position 2), E is in word (but not position 3), S exists (but not position 4).

Guess 4: POSES → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)  
→ P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, S(3) ✓, E(4) -, S(5) -.

From POSES:
- S(3) is correct.
- E(4) is in word but misplaced → E is not in 4.
- S(5) is in word but misplaced → S is not in 5 (but we already have S in 3, so this implies no second S).

Thus the pattern is P O S _ _ with E still needing placement. The only remaining spot for E is position 4, but feedback says E is not in 4. This is a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait: the feedback on POSES:
P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)

This means:
- P ✓ at 1
- O ✓ at 2
- S ✓ at 3
- E at 4 is misplaced (so E exists but not at 4)
- S at 5 is misplaced (so S exists but not at 5 – redundant since S is already at 3)

So the word must be P O S _ _ and must contain E, but E cannot be in 4 or 5. But positions 1-3 are P,O,S – none of which can be E. This implies no possible placement for E, which is impossible. Therefore my assumption that P is position 1 must be re-examined.

Re-reading feedback on POEMS:
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-)
Here P was marked ✓, but that does NOT guarantee it is position 1. It means P is in the word and in the position guessed (which was position 1). So P is confirmed position 1.

Similarly, POSES feedback shows O is position 2.

Thus the confirmed pattern is P O S _ _ with:
- E must be present (from CRANE and SLIDE), yet cannot be in positions 1-5 without conflict.

This reveals the only possible resolution: the word is P O S E Y.

Check:
- P O S E Y
- Letters used: P, O, S, E, Y – none forbidden.
- Validate against feedback:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) – E present ✓  
SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓) – S misplaced (SLIDE had S at 1, word has S at 3) ✓, E present ✓  
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-) – P ✓, O misplaced (POEMS had O at 2, word has O at 2 – but feedback said O misplaced; contradiction).

Wait, this shows the issue: POEMS feedback said O(✓) meaning O was in the correct position (2). So O is confirmed at 2.

Therefore the word must be P O S _ _ with E somewhere in positions 3-5, but:
- position 3 is S
- position 4 and 5 cannot hold E (from POEMS and POSES feedback)

Hence no placement for E – this is impossible unless my interpretation is wrong.

Re-expressing:

From POSES: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-)

- P and O are in correct positions 1 and 2.
- S is in correct position 3.
- E is in word but not in position 4.
- S is in word but not in position 5 (redundant).

Thus the word is P O S _ _ with E needing placement, but:
- position 4 cannot be E
- position 5 cannot be E (from POEMS feedback)

No valid placement – this implies the word must be P O S S E, but that would have S at 5 marked ✓, not “-”.

The only remaining valid word that satisfies all constraints is P O S S E, but feedback contradicts.

Realization: The feedback rules state that if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the word, the excess instances are marked “x”.

Let me re-interpret POSES feedback:
Word has P O S E (with E in position 5) – then the word is P O S _ E.

But then E would be in position 5, matching CRANE feedback (E in word), and POEMS showed E(-) meaning E is not in position 3, POSES showed E(-) meaning E is not in position 4 – so E must be in 5.

The only valid word fitting P O S _ E is P O S S E – but that repeats S.

However, POSES had S at 3 and 5; if the true word has S at 3 only, then the second S in POSES would be marked “x” not “-”. Since it was marked “-”, this implies the word has S in position 5 as well.

Thus the word must be P O S S E.

Let me test feedback against P O S S E:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) – matches (E present)  
SLIDE → S(-) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓) – S (at 3) is misplaced from SLIDE’s position 1 ✓, E present ✓  
POEMS → P(✓) O(✓) E(-) M(x) S(-) – P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, E(3) - (correct, E is at 5), S(4) - (S is at 3 and 5, so S at 4 is misplaced) ✓  
POSES → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(-) S(-) – P(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, S(3) ✓, E(4) - (correct, E is at 5), S(5) - (correct, S is at 3 so 5 is wrong) ✓

All feedback aligns.

Therefore the secret word is POSSE.The accumulated feedback now shows the pattern **P O S _ E** with a second **S** required in position 4 to satisfy the “S is misplaced” clues.

The only standard 5-letter word that fits is:",Guess 5: POSSE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
