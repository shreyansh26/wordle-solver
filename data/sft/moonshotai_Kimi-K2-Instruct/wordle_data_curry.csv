For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities effectively. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters across different positions. This provides good information about which of these letters are in the word and their potential positions.

The feedback for SLATE tells me that **none** of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid any word containing any of those five letters.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- is 5 letters,  
- uses entirely different letters from S, L, A, T, E,  
- still uses fairly common English letters to maximize information.

A good candidate set is the consonants B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc., and the vowels I, O, U.  
One strong, high-entropy opener that avoids the eliminated letters is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y).

It brings in new vowels (O), common consonants (C, R, N) and a less common one (Y) to test for additional vowel/consonant possibilities.

From the feedback:

- C is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).
- O and N are not in the word.

So we have:
- Pos 1: C
- Pos 5: Y
- R appears somewhere in positions 2-4, but not in its original position (which was 2).

Letters to avoid entirely: S, L, A, T, E, O, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Ends with Y
- Contains R somewhere in positions 2-4
- Uses only remaining allowed letters (from the unused set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)

Good candidates:
- CR_ _Y: Not possible because R can't be in position 2.
- C_ R_ Y: Possible.
- C_ _ R Y: Possible.

Let me think of words:
- CUBRY – not a valid word
- CURVY – uses R in position 3, and V is allowed. This seems valid.
- CUBRY – invalid
- CUPRY – invalid
- CURDY – uses D which is allowed
- CURFY – F is allowed
- CURVY seems most common.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,curry,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities effectively. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters across different positions. This provides good information about which of these letters are in the word and their potential positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for SLATE tells me that **none** of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid any word containing any of those five letters.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- is 5 letters,  
- uses entirely different letters from S, L, A, T, E,  
- still uses fairly common English letters to maximize information.

A good candidate set is the consonants B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc., and the vowels I, O, U.  
One strong, high-entropy opener that avoids the eliminated letters is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y).

It brings in new vowels (O), common consonants (C, R, N) and a less common one (Y) to test for additional vowel/consonant possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- C is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).
- O and N are not in the word.

So we have:
- Pos 1: C
- Pos 5: Y
- R appears somewhere in positions 2-4, but not in its original position (which was 2).

Letters to avoid entirely: S, L, A, T, E, O, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Ends with Y
- Contains R somewhere in positions 2-4
- Uses only remaining allowed letters (from the unused set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)

Good candidates:
- CR_ _Y: Not possible because R can't be in position 2.
- C_ R_ Y: Possible.
- C_ _ R Y: Possible.

Let me think of words:
- CUBRY – not a valid word
- CURVY – uses R in position 3, and V is allowed. This seems valid.
- CUBRY – invalid
- CUPRY – invalid
- CURDY – uses D which is allowed
- CURFY – F is allowed
- CURVY seems most common.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters across different positions. This provides good information about which of these letters are in the word and their potential positions.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The feedback for SLATE tells me that **none** of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.  \nThat means I should avoid any word containing any of those five letters.\n\nNext, I’ll pick a word that:\n- is 5 letters,  \n- uses entirely different letters from S, L, A, T, E,  \n- still uses fairly common English letters to maximize information.\n\nA good candidate set is the consonants B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc., and the vowels I, O, U.  \nOne strong, high-entropy opener that avoids the eliminated letters is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y).\n\nIt brings in new vowels (O), common consonants (C, R, N) and a less common one (Y) to test for additional vowel/consonant possibilities.\n\n<guess>CRONY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) O(x) N(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the feedback:\n\n- C is in the correct position (1st letter).\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- O and N are not in the word.\n\nSo we have:\n- Pos 1: C\n- Pos 5: Y\n- R appears somewhere in positions 2-4, but not in its original position (which was 2).\n\nLetters to avoid entirely: S, L, A, T, E, O, N.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Starts with C\n- Ends with Y\n- Contains R somewhere in positions 2-4\n- Uses only remaining allowed letters (from the unused set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)\n\nGood candidates:\n- CR_ _Y: Not possible because R can't be in position 2.\n- C_ R_ Y: Possible.\n- C_ _ R Y: Possible.\n\nLet me think of words:\n- CUBRY – not a valid word\n- CURVY – uses R in position 3, and V is allowed.

We have the fixed pattern C U R _ Y and now know the 4th letter is **not** B or D.  
Ruled-out letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, V, B, D  
Remaining possible 4th-letter choices from the unused set: F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Z.

The only common English word that fits C U R ? Y with one of those letters is:

- **CURFY** – not a recognized word  
- **CURGY** – not valid  
- **CURKY** – not valid  
- **CURMY** – not valid  
- **CURFY** – not valid  
- **CURIY** – not valid  
- **CURPY** – not valid  
- **CURRY** – yes, “curry” is a real word and uses R again in the 4th slot, which is still allowed (R was only marked wrong-position in the very first guess, not absent). It’s also common.

Hence, the correct remaining word is **CURRY**.
