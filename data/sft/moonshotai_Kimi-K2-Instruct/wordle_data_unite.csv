For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in English, as this will help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I should try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Looking at these letters, a good combination would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This word covers 5 of the top 10 most common letters, which should give me excellent information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

We know:
- E is in the correct final position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

Letters remaining to test: many of the next-most-common ones—T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, M, P, Y, K, etc.

We want another five-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains no A, R, O, S.
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words ending in E:
- “elite” – but has two Es and we already know E is in position 5, so the first E would waste a slot.
- “tithe” – T, I, T, H, E: introduces T, I, H.
- “chute” – C, H, U, T, E: introduces C, H, U, T.
- “pique” – P, I, Q, U, E: introduces P, I, Q, U (Q is uncommon, so skip).
- “untie” – but ends with E, yet has I and E; doesn’t use E in slot 5.

Among these, “chute” gives the most new common letters (C, H, U, T) while satisfying all constraints.

So: C H U T E

3. U is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3 (- from chute).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: N, I, L, D, M, P, Y, K, G, B, F.

Candidate structures:
- U can be in position 1: U _ _ T E
- U can be in position 2: _ U _ T E
- U can be in position 3: _ _ U T E  (but from chute feedback, U is not in position 3, so this is impossible)

Therefore U must be in position 1 or 2.

U _ _ T E → Need 2 more letters from remaining common ones (N, I, L, D, M, P, Y, K, G, B, F).

Good choices:
- UNITE – letters U, N, I, T, E.  (T and E already known, but introduces N, I.)  
  But we know T is already fixed in position 4, and E in 5, so UNITE would be U N I T E – this fits perfectly!  
  It tests U (already known in word), N, I, T (known), E (known).  But we don’t know about N and I yet.

Is “unite” a valid word? Yes.

Check constraints:
- U is in word (✓)
- N, I are new letters
- T and E positions are correct
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, C, H)

This seems optimal.

Alternative with U in position 2:
_ U _ T E, e.g., “lumen” – but E is already 5th, and we need 5-letter word ending TE.  
“duvet” – but V is less common.  
“built” – but ends with T, not TE.  

“unite” seems best.
