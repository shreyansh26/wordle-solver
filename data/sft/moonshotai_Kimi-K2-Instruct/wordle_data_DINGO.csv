For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A strong starting word typically includes:

- Common vowels (like A, E, O)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular strong starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

This eliminates a lot of common letters, so I need to focus on words that:
1. Contain O, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Do NOT include A, R, S, E.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Vowels still possible: I, U, Y (O is already confirmed).

A strong next word should include O in a different position and test other common letters. ""POINT"" comes to mind:
- P: tests a common consonant.
- O: confirmed in word, placed in position 2 (not 3).
- I, N, T: all are common letters not yet tested.

So far we know:

- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, T
- Letters in the word but in the wrong positions: O (not in 3rd), I (not in 4th), N (not in 5th)

We need a word that:
1. Must contain O, I, N (each in a different slot from their last guess positions).
2. Must avoid A, R, S, E, P, T.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: O (confirmed), I (confirmed), and possibly U or Y.

Let’s look for a word that places:
- O in a new position (cannot be 3rd). Possible slots: 1, 2, 4, 5.
- I in a new position (cannot be 4th). Possible slots: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- N in a new position (cannot be 5th). Possible slots: 1, 2, 3, 4.

A word that satisfies all these is “DONIC”:
- D (new consonant)
- O (in 2nd position, new from 3rd)
- N (in 3rd position, new from 5th)
- I (in 4th position, new from 4th is invalid, so need adjustment)

Wait, this fails because I is still in 4th. Let’s fix position choices:

Try “COULD”:
- C (new)
- O (in 2nd)
- U (new, common)
- L (new)
- D (new)

But this doesn’t use N, which we know is in the word. So we must include N.

Try “UNION”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (now 2nd, new from 5th)
- I (now 3rd, new from 4th)
- O (now 4th, new from 3rd)
- N (repeats N, invalid)

Try “CONIC”:
- C (new)
- O (2nd)
- N (3rd)
- I (4th)
- C (repeats C, invalid)

Try “MOUND”:
- M (new)
- O (2nd)
- U (new)
- N (4th)
- D (new)
But missing I, which we know is in the word.

Try “BOUND”:
- B (new)
- O (2nd)
- U (new)
- N (4th)
- D (new)
Again missing I.

We need a word with O, I, N, avoiding their last positions. Let’s construct:

Possible structure:
Slot 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, etc.
Slot 2: I or O (O was in 2nd last time, so now avoid 2nd for O)
Slot 3: O or I (I was in 4th, so now can be 3rd)
Slot 4: N or O (N was in 5th, so now can be 4th)
Slot 5: remaining

Try “COBID” - invalid (no N)
Try “CONID” - not a word
Try “COGIN” - not standard
Try “FOCIN” - not a word
Try “LOINC” - not a word
Try “IONIC”:

Close, but repeats I. 

Try “MONIC”:
- M (new)
- O (2nd)
- N (3rd)
- I (4th)
- C (new)

But I would be in 4th again (invalid). 

Realize I can’t be in 4th, so must place it in 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let’s try:

“NICHO” - but H and O, and O would be 5th (valid), but H is new and we haven’t confirmed C yet.

“DONIC” - same issue as before with I in 4th.

“INDOL” - not a word.

“CODIN” - not a word.

“CONID” - not a word.

“FOCIN” - not a word.

“IONIC” - repeats I.

“MONIC” - I in 4th is invalid.

“IONIC” is invalid due to repeated I.

- I cannot be 4th (was 4th) - can be 1,2,3,5
- N cannot be 5th (was 5th) - can be 1,2,3,4

Next: “COPIN” - but P is out.

Realize must use new letters. 

Viable word: “LOD IN” no.

Finally, a valid word that fits constraints: “COB IN” no.

A real word: “CON ID” no.

Correct word: “CONID” does not exist.

Realize must use “COBID” - invalid.

Best actual word found: “MONIC” - but I in 4th invalid.

Wait, re-examine CONSTRAINTS:
O cannot be 3rd
I cannot be 4th
N cannot be 5th

We need O, I, N in new positions. 

Try “IONIC” - repeats I.

Try “INDOL” - no.

Try “DOING”:
- D (new)
- O (now 2nd)
- I (now 3rd)
- N (now 4th)
- G (new)

This uses O in 2nd (new from 3rd), I in 3rd (new from 4th), N in 4th (new from 5th), and D, G are new unused letters. 

“DOING” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.

Best actual word found: “MONIC” - but I would be 4th (invalid).

Next: “COPIN” - but P is out.

Realize must use new letters. 

Viable word: “LOD IN” no.

Finally, a valid word that fits constraints: “COB IN” no.

A real word: “CON ID” no.

Correct word: “CONID” does not exist.

Realize must use “COBID” - invalid.

Best actual word found: “MONIC” - but I in 4th invalid.

Wait, re-examine CONSTRAINTS:
O cannot be 3rd
I cannot be 4th
N cannot be 5th

We need O, I, N in new positions. 

Try “IONIC” - repeats I.

Try “INDOL” - no.

Try “DOING”:
- D (new)
- O (now 2nd)
- I (now 3rd)
- N (now 4th)
- G (new)

This uses O in 2nd (new from 3rd), I in 3rd (new from 4th), N in 4th (new from 5th), and D, G are new unused letters. 

“DOING” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A strong starting word typically includes:

- Common vowels (like A, E, O)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular strong starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

This eliminates a lot of common letters, so I need to focus on words that:
1. Contain O, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Do NOT include A, R, S, E.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Vowels still possible: I, U, Y (O is already confirmed).

A strong next word should include O in a different position and test other common letters. ""POINT"" comes to mind:
- P: tests a common consonant.
- O: confirmed in word, placed in position 2 (not 3).
- I, N, T: all are common letters not yet tested.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, S, E, P, T
- Letters in the word but in the wrong positions: O (not in 3rd), I (not in 4th), N (not in 5th)

We need a word that:
1. Must contain O, I, N (each in a different slot from their last guess positions).
2. Must avoid A, R, S, E, P, T.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, H, M, G, B, F, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: O (confirmed), I (confirmed), and possibly U or Y.

Let’s look for a word that places:
- O in a new position (cannot be 3rd). Possible slots: 1, 2, 4, 5.
- I in a new position (cannot be 4th). Possible slots: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- N in a new position (cannot be 5th). Possible slots: 1, 2, 3, 4.

A word that satisfies all these is “DONIC”:
- D (new consonant)
- O (in 2nd position, new from 3rd)
- N (in 3rd position, new from 5th)
- I (in 4th position, new from 4th is invalid, so need adjustment)

Wait, this fails because I is still in 4th. Let’s fix position choices:

Try “COULD”:
- C (new)
- O (in 2nd)
- U (new, common)
- L (new)
- D (new)

But this doesn’t use N, which we know is in the word. So we must include N.

Try “UNION”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (now 2nd, new from 5th)
- I (now 3rd, new from 4th)
- O (now 4th, new from 3rd)
- N (repeats N, invalid)

Try “CONIC”:
- C (new)
- O (2nd)
- N (3rd)
- I (4th)
- C (repeats C, invalid)

Try “MOUND”:
- M (new)
- O (2nd)
- U (new)
- N (4th)
- D (new)
But missing I, which we know is in the word.

Try “BOUND”:
- B (new)
- O (2nd)
- U (new)
- N (4th)
- D (new)
Again missing I.

We need a word with O, I, N, avoiding their last positions. Let’s construct:

Possible structure:
Slot 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, etc.
Slot 2: I or O (O was in 2nd last time, so now avoid 2nd for O)
Slot 3: O or I (I was in 4th, so now can be 3rd)
Slot 4: N or O (N was in 5th, so now can be 4th)
Slot 5: remaining

Try “COBID” - invalid (no N)
Try “CONID” - not a word
Try “COGIN” - not standard
Try “FOCIN” - not a word
Try “LOINC” - not a word
Try “IONIC”:
- I (1st)
- O (2nd)
- N (3rd)
- I (repeats I, invalid)
- C (5th)

Close, but repeats I. 

Try “MONIC”:
- M (new)
- O (2nd)
- N (3rd)
- I (4th)
- C (new)

But I would be in 4th again (invalid). 

Realize I can’t be in 4th, so must place it in 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let’s try:

“NICHO” - but H and O, and O would be 5th (valid), but H is new and we haven’t confirmed C yet.

“DONIC” - same issue as before with I in 4th.

“INDOL” - not a word.

“IONIC” - repeats I.

“CODIN” - not a word.

“CONID” - not a word.

“FOCIN” - not a word.

“IONIC” - repeats I.

“MONIC” - I in 4th is invalid.

“IONIC” is invalid due to repeated I.

Finally, “COBID” fails as said.

Realize the strict constraints:
Must have O, I, N, none in their previous slots:
- O cannot be 3rd (was 3rd) - can be 1,2,4,5
- I cannot be 4th (was 4th) - can be 1,2,3,5
- N cannot be 5th (was 5th) - can be 1,2,3,4

A word satisfying: O in 1st, I in 3rd, N in 4th:
Structure: O _ I N _

Need valid consonants left (avoiding P,T,R,S,E,A): possible D, L, C, M, etc.

“O C I N _” - need 5th letter. “OCIND” - invalid.

“O D I N _” - “ODIN_” - “ODING” - not standard.

“O M I N _” - “OMIN_” - “OMING” - no.

“O B I N _” - “OBING” - no.

Try O in 5th:
_ _ _ _ O
But need N and I somewhere.

Try “DUNIO” - not a word.

“MUXIN” - not a word.

Wait, simpler: “CONID” is not a word. 

Realize “IONIC” is almost valid but repeats I. 

Best actual word found: “MONIC” - but I would be 4th (invalid).

Next: “COPIN” - but P is out.

Realize must use new letters. 

Viable word: “LOD IN” no.

Finally, a valid word that fits constraints: “COB IN” no.

A real word: “CON ID” no.

Correct word: “CONID” does not exist.

Realize must use “COBID” - invalid.

Best actual word found: “MONIC” - but I in 4th invalid.

Wait, re-examine CONSTRAINTS:
O cannot be 3rd
I cannot be 4th
N cannot be 5th

We need O, I, N in new positions. 

Try “IONIC” - repeats I.

Try “INDOL” - no.

Try “DOING”:
- D (new)
- O (now 2nd)
- I (now 3rd)
- N (now 4th)
- G (new)

This uses O in 2nd (new from 3rd), I in 3rd (new from 4th), N in 4th (new from 5th), and D, G are new unused letters. 

“DOING” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.
