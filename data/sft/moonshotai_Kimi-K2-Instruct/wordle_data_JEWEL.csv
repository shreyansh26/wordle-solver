- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover a mix of these. 

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they include high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

So far we know:

- R, A, I, S are **not in the word at all** (x).
- E is in the word but **not in the last position** (-).

That eliminates a huge chunk of the alphabet (R, A, I, S) and tells us E appears exactly once and must be in positions 1-4.  
Good letters to test next include other common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A fresh set: T, O, N, E, U.  
A word that uses four of these is “TUNER” (T, U, N, E, R).  
But R is already ruled out, so skip that.  
Next candidate: “TONEY” – uses T, O, N, E, Y. It keeps E while introducing T, O, N, Y.

From the two clues:

So the pattern at this point is:
_ _ _ E _

Useful remaining letters (that have not been ruled out) include:
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We also want to use E again if possible, but it’s now locked in position 4.  
To maximize information, pick a word with three or four new letters and keep E in place.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,JEWEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover a mix of these. 

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they include high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- R, A, I, S are **not in the word at all** (x).
- E is in the word but **not in the last position** (-).

That eliminates a huge chunk of the alphabet (R, A, I, S) and tells us E appears exactly once and must be in positions 1-4.  
Good letters to test next include other common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A fresh set: T, O, N, E, U.  
A word that uses four of these is “TUNER” (T, U, N, E, R).  
But R is already ruled out, so skip that.  
Next candidate: “TONEY” – uses T, O, N, E, Y. It keeps E while introducing T, O, N, Y.

So my second guess is TONEY.

<guess>TONEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) N(x) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues:
- Letters ruled out: R, A, I, S, T, O, N, Y  
- Letter confirmed: E in position 4 (because the feedback was E(✓))

So the pattern at this point is:
_ _ _ E _

Useful remaining letters (that have not been ruled out) include:
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We also want to use E again if possible, but it’s now locked in position 4.  
To maximize information, pick a word with three or four new letters and keep E in place.

Candidate: “HUMVE” – uses H, U, M, V, E.  
H, U, M, V are all still in play.  
E is fixed in the 4th spot.

So guess: HUMVE.

<guess>HUMVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) N(x) E(✓) Y(x)
Guess 3: HUMVE -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(x) M(x) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:

- R, A, I, S, T, O, N, Y, H, U, M, V are all **out**.
- E is in the word, but **not in position 4** (from Guess 3) and **not in position 5** (from Guess 1).  
  So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- We still need five-letter English words that:
  – contain the letter E,
  – do **not** contain any of the 12 letters already ruled out,
  – have E in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining usable letters (besides E):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, W, X, Z

Let’s look for common words fitting the pattern.  
One possibility is “BEZEL”: B, E, Z, E, L.  
- E appears in positions 2 and 4, but E cannot be in position 4, so that’s out.  
Another possibility is “CELEB”: C, E, L, E, B. Again E in position 4 – invalid.  
How about “BLEED”? B, L, E, E, D. E in position 3 and 4 – invalid.  
“FLECK” has E in position 3; letters used are F, L, E, C, K – none ruled out.  
That looks good: E in position 3.

So the next guess is “FLECK”.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are OUT (x in every position so far):
R A I S T O N Y H U M V F C K

Confirmed letters still IN:
- E is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 2.

New facts from Guess 4:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (feedback L(-)).  
  In “FLECK”, L was in position 2, so L cannot be in position 2.  
  Therefore L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining letters that have never been used and are still legal:
B D G J P Q W X Z   (plus E and L)

We need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Uses E (in position 1 or 2),
2. Uses L (not in position 2),
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Quick scan:
- If E is in position 1: E L _ _ _ or E _ L _ _ or E _ _ L _ or E _ _ _ L  
  Possible words: “ELBOW” – but O and W are legal, but we already have O ruled out.  
  “ELBOW” – O is out, so discard.  
- “EXPEL” – P is still legal, X is legal, but L is in position 4, which is allowed.  
  Letters: E X P E L – contains E twice (positions 1 and 4) and L (position 5).  
  All letters used are still legal (E, X, P, L).  
  This satisfies:  
  – E in position 1 (allowed).  
  – L in position 5 (allowed).  
  – No forbidden letters.

Hence, my next guess is EXPEL.

Let's carefully update what we know after each clue.

Letters ruled out (x):  
R, A, I, S, T, O, N, Y, H, U, M, V, F, C, K, X, P  

Letters still allowed (unused so far):  
B, D, G, J, Q, W, Z   (plus the confirmed letters below)

Confirmed letters still in the word:
- E must appear at least once and is in the **correct** position 4 (from Guess 5: E(✓) in position 4).
- L must appear at least once and is in the **correct** position 5 (from Guess 5: L(✓) in position 5).

So the true word must look like:  
_ _ _ E L

Positions 1, 2, and 3 must be filled only from the still-allowed letters B, D, G, J, Q, W, Z.  
We need a 5-letter English word ending in “EL”.  
Among the remaining letters, the only realistic consonants are B, D, G, W.

Quick scan for common words ending in “EL”:
- “B” in front: B E L → too short.  
- Three-letter start: “bedel”, “gibel” (not common), “wedel” (rare), “jewel”.  
  – “jewel” uses J-E-W-E-L.  
  – “bedel” uses B-E-D-E-L.  
  – “wedel” uses W-E-D-E-L.  

Among them, “BEDEL” is a valid English word (a minor church official), and all its letters are still allowed:
B, E, D, E, L  
- E in position 4 ✓  
- L in position 5 ✓  
- B, D are allowed.

Therefore, the final guess is “BEDEL”.
