For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants to help eliminate possibilities early. Good starting words often contain letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

Let me think of a word with 3 consonants and 2 vowels, using some of the most common letters. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it uses S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). Another good option could be ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters in good positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has an S but it’s not in position 1.
- The word has no L, A, T, E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid L, A, T, E.
- We still have 25–4 = 21 letters to consider, but we can focus on consonants and the other vowels (I, O, U, Y).

Good next words use letters we haven’t tried yet (other than S) and move the S to different positions. Words like “SOUND” or “SHIRT” might be useful, but let’s pick one that covers many new letters.

I’ll choose “SOUND”:
- S is tested again but now in position 1 (to see if moving it helps).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters not in LATE.

- Letters L, A, T, E, O, U, N, D are NOT in the word at all.
- Letters still untested and worth trying include: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- We need a valid 5-letter word that:
  – contains S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5,
  – uses none of the eliminated letters (L,A,T,E,O,U,N,D).

A handy word that fits is “CRISP”:

- All letters are still allowed and we haven’t tried any of them yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The word should include frequent vowels and consonants to help eliminate possibilities early. Good starting words often contain letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

Let me think of a word with 3 consonants and 2 vowels, using some of the most common letters. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it uses S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). Another good option could be ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters in good positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has an S but it’s not in position 1.
- The word has no L, A, T, E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid L, A, T, E.
- We still have 25–4 = 21 letters to consider, but we can focus on consonants and the other vowels (I, O, U, Y).

Good next words use letters we haven’t tried yet (other than S) and move the S to different positions. Words like “SOUND” or “SHIRT” might be useful, but let’s pick one that covers many new letters.

I’ll choose “SOUND”:
- S is tested again but now in position 1 (to see if moving it helps).
- O, U, N, D are all new letters not in LATE.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(x) N(x) D(x)

SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
SOUND → S(-) O(x) U(x) N(x) D(x)

Key deductions so far:
- S is definitely in the word, but NOT in position 1 or 2 (since it was marked “-” in both places).
- Letters L, A, T, E, O, U, N, D are NOT in the word at all.
- Letters still untested and worth trying include: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- We need a valid 5-letter word that:
  – contains S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5,
  – uses none of the eliminated letters (L,A,T,E,O,U,N,D).

A handy word that fits is “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, P are new letters.
- S is placed in position 4 (a new spot).
- All letters are still allowed and we haven’t tried any of them yet.
