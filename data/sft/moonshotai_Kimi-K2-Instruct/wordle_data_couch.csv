For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeated letters to test more unique letters
3. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants

Some common starting words are: AROSE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU. After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems excellent because it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- A, R, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the hidden word:
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses O somewhere other than the 3rd spot (so slots 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
- Introduces as many fresh, common letters as possible to narrow things down.

Some candidate consonants and vowels still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next word should cover fresh ground. “POINT” comes to mind:
- Uses O in position 2 (not 3) ✔
- Skips the ruled-out letters ✔
- Introduces P, I, N, T, which are all still possible ✔

Here’s what we now know:

- The word contains O, and the O is in position 2 (second letter).
- The letters A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T are all absent.
- Remaining unused, common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, plus O already fixed in slot 2.

We need a 5-letter word whose pattern is _ O _ _ _, using only the still-available letters and containing no repeats.

Let’s look for a promising candidate:
- C, L, U, B, D, M, F, G, H are all still possible.
- A word like “CLOUD” or “FOUL” won’t work because it re-introduces ruled-out letters.
- “DOLLY” is invalid (double L and double Y? Actually Y is allowed, but L is only once). However “DOLLY” uses Y, which is fine, but we’d rather test entirely new consonants.
- Instead, let’s pick a word that introduces several new consonants while keeping O in slot 2. “HOUND” is invalid (N and D are ok, but U is allowed, yet we already eliminated N). 
- Actually N is eliminated. So is T, I, P…
- Let’s try “BOUGH” – but G and H are allowed. Wait, but we want to test multiple remaining consonants without repeats.

A better choice: “GLOOM” – but O repeats, and M is allowed, but that gives us nothing new.
Next: “FLOUT” – but T is eliminated.
Next: “WOMBY” – W and Y are allowed, M and B too. But is WOMBY a valid word? Yes, “womby” is archaic but acceptable. However, we prefer common words.

A simpler, common word: “MOULD” – but L and D are fine, U is fine. However D and L are ok. Actually L, U, D are all still possible and no repeats. So _ O U _ _ or _ O _ _ _. Actually O is fixed in position 2.

Let’s go with “MOULD”:
- M, O, U, L, D – all still possible letters.
- O is in position 2 ✔
- No repeats.
- All five letters are fresh tests.

So: MOULD fits the constraints and is a common word.

From the latest feedback on COUGH:
- C is in the word and in the **correct** position: position 1.
- O is in the word and in the **correct** position: position 2.
- U is in the word and in the **correct** position: position 3.
- H is in the word but in the **wrong** position (it’s currently in position 5).
- G is **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern we now have is:

C  O  U  ?  ?

and we know H appears somewhere else (positions 4 or 5, but NOT 3 because U is already there, and not 1 or 2).

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word so far:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, M, L, D, G.

Still-available letters (for positions 4 and 5):  
B, F, J, K, V, W, Y, Z, and H (with H required to appear once).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form C O U _ _ that contains the letter H once and does not repeat any other letters and does not use any of the disallowed letters.

Let’s list plausible endings:
- COU + B + H → COUBH (not a word)
- COU + C + H → impossible (C already used)
- COU + H + B → COUHB (not a word)
- COU + B + Y → COUBY (not a word)
- COU + H + K → COUHK (not a word)
- COU + Y + H → COUYH (not a word)
- COU + K + H → COUKH (close, but “coukh” is not standard)
- COU + F + H → COUFH (not a word)
- COU + B + ? other options…

Wait—what valid words actually fit C O U _ _ and contain H exactly once?

A quick mental scan:
- cough (already used, G disallowed)
- couch (C, O, U, C, H → C repeats) – invalid
- could (L disallowed)
- count (N, T disallowed)
- court (R disallowed)
- couth (valid; letters C, O, U, T, H – but T is disallowed)
- coypu (doesn’t have H)

So the only remaining candidate that is a real English word, uses C O U _ _, includes H once, and avoids all forbidden letters is:

C O U C H – but that repeats C.

There are no other standard 5-letter English words matching C O U _ _ that include H exactly once without using any of the ruled-out letters.

This suggests the hidden word must be a less-common or non-obvious word, but standard Wordle lexicons contain:

“COUCH” – but C repeats, which is impossible (C already fixed in position 1).  
“COUGH” – G ruled out.  
“COULD” – L and D ruled out.  
“COUNT” – N and T ruled out.  
“COUTH” – T ruled out.  

We’re left with a unique possibility: “COUCH” is impossible because C repeats. Therefore, the only remaining valid word fitting every constraint is “COUCH” but it’s disallowed.

Wait—there’s another word: “COUTH” uses T, which is out.  
“COB??” – what about COB + H + ?

“COB” is not a 3-letter start in the pattern.

Actually, re-scanning the list of valid English 5-letter words starting with “cou”, the only ones are:

could, count, court, couch, cough, couth, and a few rarer ones.

All of those are ruled out by the letters we’ve eliminated.

This implies the hidden word must be **COUCH** even though it repeats C, but we’ve been told C is already in position 1 correctly, so repeating C elsewhere would have been flagged by the earlier feedback.

Given that, the only remaining candidate that satisfies all constraints is **COUCH**, despite the C. But since no valid word exists without repeating letters or using ruled-out letters, this must be the intended answer, and the feedback would have to allow C twice (but standard Wordle rules disallow letter reuse).

Realizing the oversight: perhaps I missed a word. Let me double-check:

- C O U B H – invalid  
- C O U K H – invalid  
- C O U F H – invalid  

Thus, no valid word remains under standard lexicon except COUCH. Clearly, the hidden word is COUCH, and the feedback for G being out confirms cough is not the word.

However, COUCH contains C twice, which is impossible because C is already fixed in position 1. Therefore, the only standard word fitting C O U _ _ with H elsewhere is **COUCH**, despite the repetition.

Upon reflection, this indicates the hidden word must be **COUCH**. The feedback would have to permit C in both spots, which is standard in Wordle.

So the correct word is **COUCH**.

- H is in the word but in the **wrong** position (it’s currently in position 5).
- G is **not** in the word at all.

C  O  U  ?  ?

and we know H appears somewhere else (positions 4 or 5, but NOT 3 because U is already there, and not 1 or 2).

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word so far:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, M, L, D, G.

Still-available letters (for positions 4 and 5):  
B, F, J, K, V, W, Y, Z, and H (with H required to appear once).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form C O U _ _ that contains the letter H once and does not repeat any other letters and does not use any of the disallowed letters.

Let’s list plausible endings:
- COU + B + H → COUBH (not a word)
- COU + C + H → impossible (C already used)
- COU + H + B → COUHB (not a word)
- COU + B + Y → COUBY (not a word)
- COU + H + K → COUHK (not a word)
- COU + Y + H → COUYH (not a word)
- COU + K + H → COUKH (close, but “coukh” is not standard)
- COU + F + H → COUFH (not a word)
- COU + B + ? other options…

Wait—what valid words actually fit C O U _ _ and contain H exactly once?

A quick mental scan:
- cough (already used, G disallowed)
- couch (C, O, U, C, H → C repeats) – invalid
- could (L disallowed)
- count (N, T disallowed)
- court (R disallowed)
- couth (valid; letters C, O, U, T, H – but T is disallowed)
- coypu (doesn’t have H)

So the only remaining candidate that is a real English word, uses C O U _ _, includes H once, and avoids all forbidden letters is:

C O U C H – but that repeats C.

There are no other standard 5-letter English words matching C O U _ _ that include H exactly once without using any of the ruled-out letters.

This suggests the hidden word must be a less-common or non-obvious word, but standard Wordle lexicons contain:

“COUCH” – but C repeats, which is impossible (C already fixed in position 1).  
“COUGH” – G ruled out.  
“COULD” – L and D ruled out.  
“COUNT” – N and T ruled out.  
“COUTH” – T ruled out.  

We’re left with a unique possibility: “COUCH” is impossible because C repeats. Therefore, the only remaining valid word fitting every constraint is “COUCH” but it’s disallowed.

Wait—there’s another word: “COUTH” uses T, which is out.  
“COB??” – what about COB + H + ?

“COB” is not a 3-letter start in the pattern.

Actually, re-scanning the list of valid English 5-letter words starting with “cou”, the only ones are:

could, count, court, couch, cough, couth, and a few rarer ones.

All of those are ruled out by the letters we’ve eliminated.

This implies the hidden word must be **COUCH** even though it repeats C, but we’ve been told C is already in position 1 correctly, so repeating C elsewhere would have been flagged by the earlier feedback.

Given that, the only remaining candidate that satisfies all constraints is **COUCH**, despite the C. But since no valid word exists without repeating letters or using ruled-out letters, this must be the intended answer, and the feedback would have to allow C twice (but standard Wordle rules disallow letter reuse).

Realizing the oversight: perhaps I missed a word. Let me double-check:

- C O U B H – invalid  
- C O U K H – invalid  
- C O U F H – invalid  

Thus, no valid word remains under standard lexicon except COUCH. Clearly, the hidden word is COUCH, and the feedback for G being out confirms cough is not the word.

However, COUCH contains C twice, which is impossible because C is already fixed in position 1. Therefore, the only standard word fitting C O U _ _ with H elsewhere is **COUCH**, despite the repetition.

Upon reflection, this indicates the hidden word must be **COUCH**. The feedback would have to permit C in both spots, which is standard in Wordle.

So the correct word is **COUCH**.",Guess 5: COUCH -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
