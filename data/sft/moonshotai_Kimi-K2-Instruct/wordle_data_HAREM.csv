For a first guess, I want to choose a common 5-letter word that uses frequent letters across the alphabet to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (A,R,O,S,E)
- All letters appear in the top 15 most common English letters
- The vowels (A,O,E) and common consonants (R,S) help check many possible word patterns
- It's a valid English word

This gives us good coverage across different letter types and positions to interpret the feedback effectively.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A, R, E but NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
2. It does NOT contain O or S.
3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the rest of the alphabet (excluding O, S).

Since we have three known letters (A, R, E) and need two more, and we have no information yet about letters like T, N, I, etc., we should try to rearrange A, R, E with two new common letters.

A good approach is to try moving A, R, E to different positions while introducing new common consonants. ""TREAD"" is a good candidate because:
- It reuses A, R, E but in different positions (A is now 4th, R is 1st, E is 3rd - none of these were their original positions)
- Introduces T and D, two very common consonants we haven't tested yet
- It's a valid English word

From both guesses we now know:

Letters still in play (must be used):  
A, R, E (each is in the word but not in the positions already tried)

Letters eliminated:  
O, S, T, D

So far tried positions for each letter:

A: positions 1 (✗), 4 (✗)  
R: positions 2 (✗), 2 (✗)  
E: positions 5 (✗), 3 (✗)

That means:
- A cannot be 1st or 4th → possible 2,3,5
- R cannot be 2nd → possible 1,3,4,5
- E cannot be 3rd or 5th → possible 1,2,4

We need two additional letters that have never been used. Common unused consonants: N, L, C, B, G, M, etc. Vowels already tried: A, E. So the missing vowel could be I or U, or no extra vowel at all.

Let’s pick two new common consonants and arrange A, R, E so that none of them repeat their forbidden slots.  
Try:  
- 1st: C  
- 2nd: A (allowed: positions 2,3,5)  
- 3rd: R (allowed: 1,3,4,5)  
- 4th: E (allowed: 1,2,4)  
- 5th: N  

Word = C A R E N → but “caren” isn’t a valid English word.  
Swap positions: try A in 3rd, R in 4th, E in 2nd → 1st and 5th new letters.  
Word = N E A R ?  
Take L for last letter: “NEARL” isn’t valid; use “NEARS” but S is eliminated.  
Next common consonant: B → “BEARN” (invalid), “EARLB” (invalid), “EARLY” (Y untested).  
“EARLY” uses Y which hasn’t been ruled out.  
Positions check:
E: allowed 1,2,4 → E is 1st ✔  
A: allowed 2,3,5 → A is 2nd ✔

From the three pieces of feedback we have:

Letters that MUST be in the word (✓ / - so far):  
- A is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 2.  
- R is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 3.  
- E is in the word but NOT positions 1, 3, 5 (from earlier tries).

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):  
O, S, T, D, L, Y

So the word looks like: _ A R _ _  
We still need two more letters. They must be from the remaining alphabet (26 – {A,R,E,O,S,T,D,L,Y}) and must not include any of those already ruled out.

Remaining common consonants we have not used: N, C, B, G, M, P, H, K, F, V, W, Z ...  
Remaining vowels we have not used: I, U (since A, E are already present).

We also know E must appear somewhere in the remaining two slots (positions 1, 4, 5) but not at 1 or 5 (from previous E feedback). Therefore:

E must be in position 4.

So the template is now: _ A R E _

The only remaining slot to fill is position 1. It must be a new consonant not yet eliminated. The most common unused consonants are: N, C, B, G, M, P, H.

Let’s pick the most frequent remaining consonant: N.

That gives us N A R E _ . The last letter still needs to be determined. We have used N, A, R, E so far. We need one more letter. It must be unused and not eliminated. Let’s see which letters are still possible in position 5.

Possible new letters for position 5: any consonant not yet used and not eliminated. Let’s go with the next most common one: C.

This would give us N A R E C – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Next common: B → N A R E B (invalid).

Next: G → N A R E G (invalid).

Next: M → N A R E M (invalid).

Next: C → already tried.

Next: K → N A R E K (invalid).

Next: H → N A R E H (invalid).

Hmm, none of these work. Let’s try another consonant in position 1. Instead of N, try C.

C A R E _ – now position 5 must be a new consonant. Try K: C A R E K – not a word. Try G: C A R E G – not a word.

Try B: B A R E _ – now position 5: common remaining consonants are N, C, G, M, etc. B A R E N is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- B: new letter, not previously used or eliminated.  
- A: position 2 (confirmed ✓).  
- R: position 3 (confirmed ✓).  
- E: position 4 (only remaining allowed position).  
- N: new letter.

""BAREN"" isn’t a word, but ""BARREN"" is 6 letters. The valid 5-letter word is B A R E N, but that’s spelled B A R E N (baren't?) – actually, no, the correct spelling is ""BARREN"" (6 letters). So B A R E N is invalid.

Next candidate: G A R E _ → G A R E K (invalid), G A R E N (invalid).

Next: M A R E _ → M A R E K (invalid), M A R E N – this is a valid word: MAREN? No, but ""MAREN"" isn’t recognized. Actually, ""MAREN"" isn’t standard.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter English words of the form _ A R E _:

Possible endings:  
- B A R E D → but D is eliminated.  
- C A R E D → D eliminated.  
- F A R E D → D eliminated.  
- H A R E M → M is allowed, H is allowed.  
- P A R E D → D eliminated.  
- S A R E E → S eliminated.  
- W A R E D → D eliminated.  
- C A R E T → T eliminated.  
- C A R E R → but R is already in position 3 (can’t repeat R in position 5 unless word allows double R).  
- H A R E M is valid.

Check: H A R E M

Letters: H (new), A (✓ position 2), R (✓ position 3), E (√ position 4), M (new). All constraints met.

Thus, the guess is HAREM.
