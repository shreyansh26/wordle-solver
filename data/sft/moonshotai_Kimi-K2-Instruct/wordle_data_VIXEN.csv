Since this is the first guess, I have no previous feedback to work with. The best strategy for a first Wordle guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good first guesses typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc.

Some common strong opening words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should provide good coverage of the most frequent letters in English words.

So far I know:

- I is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.
- R, A, S are NOT in the word at all.

Next guess should:
1. Include both I and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Place I in a new spot (not 3) and E in a new spot (not 5).
3. Avoid R, A, S entirely.
4. Use mostly new consonants to keep narrowing possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let me build a word that fits:
- Use I in position 2 (e.g., _ I _ _ _).
- Use E in position 3 (e.g., _ I E _ _).
- Fill remaining slots with fresh consonants: N, T, L.

A valid word: T I E N _ → but ""TIEN"" isn't a 5-letter word.  
A real word: L I E N S → but S is already ruled out.  
Next: T I E N E → no.  
Try: N I E C E → C and N are valid new consonants, E is used (allowed twice).  
Check: NIECE – letters N, I, E, C, E. Ruled-out letters are avoided. E appears twice, but there’s no rule against it, and it tests E in position 4.

So I’ll go with NIECE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The best strategy for a first Wordle guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good first guesses typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc.

Some common strong opening words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should provide good coverage of the most frequent letters in English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far I know:

- I is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.
- R, A, S are NOT in the word at all.

Next guess should:
1. Include both I and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Place I in a new spot (not 3) and E in a new spot (not 5).
3. Avoid R, A, S entirely.
4. Use mostly new consonants to keep narrowing possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let me build a word that fits:
- Use I in position 2 (e.g., _ I _ _ _).
- Use E in position 3 (e.g., _ I E _ _).
- Fill remaining slots with fresh consonants: N, T, L.

A valid word: T I E N _ → but ""TIEN"" isn't a 5-letter word.  
A real word: L I E N S → but S is already ruled out.  
Next: T I E N E → no.  
Try: N I E C E → C and N are valid new consonants, E is used (allowed twice).  
Check: NIECE – letters N, I, E, C, E. Ruled-out letters are avoided. E appears twice, but there’s no rule against it, and it tests E in position 4.

So I’ll go with NIECE.

- Letters present but wrong place: E (was in positions 3 and 5 in guesses, but marked “-” both times).
- Letters ruled out: R, A, S, N, C.

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _
E must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4).  
Allowed consonants now: D, L, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- keeps I fixed at position 2,
- introduces E in a new spot (1, 3, or 4),
- uses fresh consonants only.

Candidate fill: let’s try E in position 4. Pattern: _ I _ E _
Good letters left for the slots: L, T, M, D, H, K, V, W.

Quick scans give: “W I V E S” – but S is out.  
“P I L E D” – D is still allowed.  
Also “D I V E T”, “M I L E D”, “T I M E D”, “H I V E D”.

Among these, “MILED” isn’t a real word, and “HIVED” is uncommon.  
“PILED” and “TIMED” are both valid.

I’ll pick “TIMED”.

Check: T, I, M, E, D — no forbidden letters, I is locked in place 2, E is now in place 4 (new), and we test consonants T, M, D.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no previous feedback to work with. The best strategy for a first Wordle guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good first guesses typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc.

Some common strong opening words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should provide good coverage of the most frequent letters in English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far I know:

- I is in the word, but not in position 3.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.
- R, A, S are NOT in the word at all.

Next guess should:
1. Include both I and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Place I in a new spot (not 3) and E in a new spot (not 5).
3. Avoid R, A, S entirely.
4. Use mostly new consonants to keep narrowing possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let me build a word that fits:
- Use I in position 2 (e.g., _ I _ _ _).
- Use E in position 3 (e.g., _ I E _ _).
- Fill remaining slots with fresh consonants: N, T, L.

A valid word: T I E N _ → but ""TIEN"" isn't a 5-letter word.  
A real word: L I E N S → but S is already ruled out.  
Next: T I E N E → no.  
Try: N I E C E → C and N are valid new consonants, E is used (allowed twice).  
Check: NIECE – letters N, I, E, C, E. Ruled-out letters are avoided. E appears twice, but there’s no rule against it, and it tests E in position 4.

So I’ll go with NIECE.

<guess>NIECE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: NIECE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(✓) E(-) C(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary so far:
- Letters confirmed: I in position 2.
- Letters present but wrong place: E (was in positions 3 and 5 in guesses, but marked “-” both times).
- Letters ruled out: R, A, S, N, C.

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _
E must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4).  
Allowed consonants now: D, L, T, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- keeps I fixed at position 2,
- introduces E in a new spot (1, 3, or 4),
- uses fresh consonants only.

Candidate fill: let’s try E in position 4. Pattern: _ I _ E _
Good letters left for the slots: L, T, M, D, H, K, V, W.

Quick scans give: “W I V E S” – but S is out.  
“P I L E D” – D is still allowed.  
Also “D I V E T”, “M I L E D”, “T I M E D”, “H I V E D”.

Among these, “MILED” isn’t a real word, and “HIVED” is uncommon.  
“PILED” and “TIMED” are both valid.

I’ll pick “TIMED”.

Check: T, I, M, E, D — no forbidden letters, I is locked in place 2, E is now in place 4 (new), and we test consonants T, M, D.

<guess>TIMED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: NIECE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(✓) E(-) C(x) E(-)
Guess 3: TIMED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:
- Pattern so far: _ I _ E _
- Confirmed letters: I in position 2, E in position 4.
- Ruled-out letters: R, A, S, N, C, T, M, D.

Still allowed consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.
We need a word that:
  – keeps I in spot 2 and E in spot 4 (✓ positions),
  – contains only allowed consonants,
  – is a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible consonant triples for 1-3-5 (remembering E is fixed at 4):
  _ I _ E _
Let’s list candidates:
  B I V E R – R is out.
  F I V E S – S is out.
  W I V E S – S out.
  L I V E D – D out.
  G I V E N – G, I, V, E, N; N out.
  H I V E D – D out.
  P I V E T – T out.
  W I L E Y – Y could work.
  V I L E D – D out.
  L I P E N – N out.
  H I L E X – X too rare.
  B I L E K – K is allowed; but “BILEK” isn’t a word.
  F I L E T – T out.
  P I L E D – D out.
  B I L E D – D out.
  V I L E R – R out.
  W I L E S – S out.
  G I L E T – T out.
  F I V E R – R out.
  F I L E R – R out.
  H I G H E – second H repeated, but “HIGHE” isn’t valid.

One real word left: W I L E Y — yes, “WILEY” is a dictionary word.

That fits all constraints:
  W (allowed), I (✓), L (allowed), E (✓), Y (allowed).

So the fourth guess will be WILEY.

<guess>WILEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: NIECE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(✓) E(-) C(x) E(-)
Guess 3: TIMED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: WILEY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ I _ E _  (I in 2, E in 4)
- Ruled-out letters so far: R, A, S, N, C, T, M, D, W, L, Y  
That leaves usable consonants: B, F, G, H, K, P, V, plus any others not yet tried.

We need:
- consonant in 1, 3, 5
- all three consonants must be from the still-allowed set
- must form a valid English word

Quick brainstorm for _ I _ E _ words using remaining consonants:

B I V E R – R out  
B I K E R – R out  
B I P E D – “BIPED” is valid  
F I V E R – R out  
G I V E R – R out  
H I V E R – R out  
P I V E R – R out  
V I B E S – S out  
V I D E O – O not yet ruled out, but we’ve never seen O tested; however we have no evidence O exists in the word, so better to avoid it  
V I P E R – R out  
K I V E R – R out  

The only clean candidate that uses only allowed letters and fits the pattern is:

B I P E D

- We need a real 5-letter word fitting the pattern with only the remaining consonants.

Candidate consonants for positions 1, 3, 5:
Allowed: F, G, H, K, V

Scan valid English words of the form ? I ? E ? with consonants only from {F,G,H,K,V} and no repeats (since duplicates weren’t tested):
