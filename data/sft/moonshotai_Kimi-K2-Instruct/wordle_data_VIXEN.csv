For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Letters to exclude: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I (each exactly once, since no repeats are indicated).
- Excludes the letters A, R, O, S, U, T.
- Has E not in position 5, N not in position 2, and I not in position 4.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But realistically, common ones among these: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need to place E, N, I and two other consonants from the allowed set.

- E could be in positions 1,2,3,4 (not 5).
- N could be in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2).
- I could be in positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

Let’s think of possible words:
- ""DYING"" – but G is allowed, but it has N in position 4 (allowed), I in position 3 (allowed), E is missing.
- ""GNOME"" – has O, which is excluded.
- ""WIDEN"" – has T is excluded, but it’s ""WIDEN"":
  - W, I, D, E, N: all letters allowed.
  - Check positions:
    - I is in position 2 (allowed, since I ≠4)
    - E is in position 4 (allowed, E ≠5)
    - N is in position 5 (allowed, N ≠2)
  - Also no excluded letters (A,R,O,S,U,T are absent).
  - So ""WIDEN"" is a valid candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which cover the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for AROSE is:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
R(x) – R is NOT in the word  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.  
- A, R, O, S are all out.  
- We need 5-letter words that contain E and avoid A, R, O, S.

To maximize coverage of remaining common letters (T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.), a good next guess is something like “UNTIE”.

UNITE is another candidate, but since we already know E isn’t in position 5, UNTIE uses E in position 4 (which is allowed) and covers new letters U, N, T, I.

Let’s go with UNTIE.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE):

- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Known letters: E, N, I  
Known positions:  
- E ≠ 5  
- N ≠ 2  
- I ≠ 4  

Letters to exclude: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I (each exactly once, since no repeats are indicated).
- Excludes the letters A, R, O, S, U, T.
- Has E not in position 5, N not in position 2, and I not in position 4.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But realistically, common ones among these: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need to place E, N, I and two other consonants from the allowed set.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- E could be in positions 1,2,3,4 (not 5).
- N could be in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2).
- I could be in positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

Let’s think of possible words:
- ""DYING"" – but G is allowed, but it has N in position 4 (allowed), I in position 3 (allowed), E is missing.
- ""GNOME"" – has O, which is excluded.
- ""WIDEN"" – has T is excluded, but it’s ""WIDEN"":
  - W, I, D, E, N: all letters allowed.
  - Check positions:
    - I is in position 2 (allowed, since I ≠4)
    - E is in position 4 (allowed, E ≠5)
    - N is in position 5 (allowed, N ≠2)
  - Also no excluded letters (A,R,O,S,U,T are absent).
  - So ""WIDEN"" is a valid candidate.

Let me verify:
- Letters: W, I, D, E, N – all allowed.
- Contains E, N, I as required.
- No disallowed letters.
- Position constraints:
  - E is 4 (≠5) ✓
  - N is 5 (≠2) ✓
  - I is 2 (≠4) ✓

- GIVEN – G is allowed, V is allowed; GIVEN is a valid word.

The latest feedback tells us:

- I(✓) – position 2 is I
- E(✓) – position 4 is E
- N(✓) – position 5 is N
- V(-) – V is in the word but not in position 3
- G(x) – G is NOT in the word

So the pattern is fixed for four positions: _ I _ E N  
We still need a letter for position 3, and it must be:

- one of the remaining alphabet letters not yet ruled out,
- cannot be G (already excluded), V (already excluded), or any of A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D (from earlier exclusions).

That leaves, for position 3, letters like: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, Y, Z (among common English letters).

Common 5-letter English words of the form ? I ? E N with V somewhere else:

The only common word is L I V E N (but L is allowed and V would have to be in position 3, which is excluded because V is marked as “in the word but not in position 3”).  
Since V cannot be in position 3, the only remaining possibility is that V is in position 1, making the word V I ? E N.  
But the remaining letter in position 3 must also avoid all excluded letters.

Allowed for position 3: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, Y, Z.  
We need a word of the form V I * E N where * is one of these.

Checking: V I B E N – not a word.  
V I C E N – not a word.  
V I F E N – not a word.  
V I H E N – not a word.  
V I K E N – not a word.  
V I L E N – not a word.  
V I M E N – not a word.  
V I P E N – not a word.  
V I Q E N – not a word.  
V I Y E N – not a word.  
V I Z E N – not a word.  

None of these are valid English words. Therefore, V cannot be the missing letter in the word. That implies the earlier assumption was incorrect. Rechecking the constraints carefully:

We have _ I _ E N, with E in 4 and N in 5.  
Letters that must be in the word: V (because V(-) indicates it's in the word but not in position 3).  
So V must fit into position 1 or 2 or 5.  
But position 2 is I, position 4 is E, position 5 is N. So V must be in position 1 or 3.  
But V is marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, V must be in position 1.  

So the word must be V I V E N – but that repeats V, which is unlikely and not a valid word.  
This contradiction implies that our earlier assumption that V is in the word must be re-examined. However, the feedback clearly states V(-).  

Realizing now that the only valid English word fitting _ I _ E N with V in position 1 is V I X E N (where V is in 1, I in 2, X in 3, E in 4, N in 5). X is allowed (not excluded), and V is in position 1 (allowed). VIXEN is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s confirm: V I X E N  
- V in position 1 (allowed, since V was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 3)  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- X in position 3 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 ✓  
- N in position 5 ✓  
- All previously excluded letters (A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D, G) are absent.  

Therefore, VIXEN is the correct guess.
