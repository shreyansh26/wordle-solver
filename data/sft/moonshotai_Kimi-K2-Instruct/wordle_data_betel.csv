For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels (especially A and E) and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels early
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing letter coverage

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are OUT: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, F, D  
Letters that are IN and their positions:  
- T is fixed at position 3 (✓)  
- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ E T _ _

We still need two more consonants (or Y) that have not yet been ruled out.  
Available letters: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

To maximize information, pick two fresh, fairly common consonants.  
Good choices: C, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “W E T L Y” → WETLY (a valid word meaning “in a wet manner”).  
It introduces W and L and keeps E in position 2, T in 3.

Another candidate could be “M E T A L” but A is already out.  
“V E T C H” but C and H are both new, yet VETCH is less common.  
“P E T A L” again uses A (out).  
So WETLY is clean and uses two new letters.

Therefore: WETLY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels (especially A and E) and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels early
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing letter coverage

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:  
A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.  
- E is in the word but is NOT in the 5th position.

We should therefore avoid A, R, O, S and try to place E somewhere other than position 5, while also introducing new common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. and remaining vowels like I, U.

A good candidate: “UNTIE”  
- Contains U, N, T, I, E  
- E is in position 3, not 5  
- Avoids the disallowed letters and uses fresh high-frequency ones

  - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (E-)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has T as the 3rd letter  
2. Contains the letter E somewhere other than position 5  
3. Uses only letters not already ruled out (no A,R,O,S,U,N,I)

Good unused letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus E we already know is in.

Let’s build a word that fits T _ T _ _ won’t work, but _ _ T _ _ will with T fixed in position 3.

Try “ETHYL” – has E in position 1 (allowed) and T in position 3, and uses only allowed letters. Wait, L is allowed, but Y is ok too. Another option is “FETID” – E in position 2 (allowed), T in 3, and uses D which is still allowed. Either would work, but “FETID” is slightly more common.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters OUT: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, F, D, W, Y, C, H
- Letters KNOWN to be IN the word: E (position 2✓), T (position 3✓), L (somewhere in the word)
- Pattern locked: _ E T _ _

Since L is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from previous feedback), the only possible position for L is position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ E T _ L

We need a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the remaining unused letters: B, G, K, M, P, V

Let's find a valid word:
- B E T _ L: BETEL (invalid, repeats E)
- G E T _ L: no valid word
- K E T _ L: KETYL (invalid, Y out)
- M E T _ L: METAL (A out)
- P E T _ L: PETAL (A out)
- V E T _ L: VETAL (invalid)
- B E T E L: invalid (E already used)
- B E T G L: invalid
- B E T K L: invalid
- B E T M L: invalid
- B E T P L: invalid
- B E T V L: invalid

Wait, let's reconsider position 4. The letter for position 4 must be from B, G, K, M, P, V and must form a valid word with _ E T _ L.

Looking at common words:
- B E T E L: invalid (E already at 2)
- B E T T L: invalid
- Actually, the valid word is BETEL (but this uses E twice which isn't allowed as E is already at position 2)

However, looking at the remaining letters carefully - we have B, G, K, M, P, V left. 

The only possible valid word is:
- B E T E L: invalid (E duplicate)
- G E T E L: invalid
- K E T E L: invalid
- M E T E L: invalid
- P E T E L: invalid
- V E T E L: invalid

This suggests we might have missed a letter. Let me re-examine the available letters:

Available consonants: B, G, K, M, P, V

We need a word _ E T _ L with these letters. The valid word is:
- B E T E L: but E is already used at position 2
- G E T T L: invalid
- Actually, the correct word is BETEL, but this has E at both positions 2 and 4, which would mean E appears twice in the word. However, from our feedback we've only confirmed one E.

But looking at the pattern _ E T _ L and knowing L must be at 5, the only possible valid word is:

B E T E L - but this uses E twice, which is allowed in Wordle (letters can repeat).

However, checking the feedback:
- E was marked as (-) in early guesses, meaning it's in the word but not in those positions
- There's no feedback indicating a second E

Let's try the word ""BETEL"":
- B E T E L
- This has E at positions 2 and 4
- But our feedback only confirms one E exists

Looking at the remaining possible words, the only valid word that fits _ E T _ L is:
""KETOL"" - but O is out
""METOL"" - but O is out
""PETAL"" - A is out
""GETUP"" - U is out
""LETUP"" - U is out

After careful reconsideration, the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is:
""B E T E L"" - BETEL

Despite the repeated E, this is the only valid word that fits the pattern _ E T _ L with remaining letters.

However, this seems problematic. Let me reconsider the available letters and constraints more carefully.

Actually, looking at the word list more carefully, there's another valid word:
""DETOX"" - but D, O, X are out
""VETKO"" - but K, O are out

Upon deeper inspection, the valid word that fits is:
""KETOL"" - but O is out
""METAL"" - A is out

The correct word fitting all constraints is:
""B E T E L"" - BETEL

This must be the answer as it's the only valid word remaining that fits the pattern _ E T _ L with L at position 5.

Based on all the feedback, the word must be _ E T _ L with L in position 5. The only valid word that fits is BETEL.

- Letters KNOWN to be IN the word: E (position 2✓), T (position 3✓), L (somewhere in the word)
- Pattern locked: _ E T _ _

Since L is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from previous feedback), the only possible position for L is position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ E T _ L

We need a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the remaining unused letters: B, G, K, M, P, V
