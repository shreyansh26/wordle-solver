For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination tests 5 distinct letters, including 3 of the most common consonants and 2 of the most common vowels. It gives us good coverage across the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Positions:
1: no S
2: no L
3: A is somewhere else
4: no T
5: E is somewhere else

So we know:
- The word must contain both A and E, but neither is in the final position.
- Neither S, L, nor T appear at all.
- The remaining letters so far are all unknown (positions 1, 2, 4, 5).

A good next word uses the known letters A and E in new positions, and fills the other spots with common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (i.e., not S, L, T). Good candidates for new letters: R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A balanced choice: CRANE  
- Uses A and E (but shifts both to new positions 3 and 5).  
- Introduces C, R, N (common letters not yet tested).  
- Avoids S, L, T as required.

This should give us more information about which of C, R, N are present and the correct placement of A and E.

- GRAPE: R at 2, A at 3 → invalid
- GRADE: R at 2, A at 3 → invalid

Best valid option seems BREAM:
- B (new letter)
- R (fixed at 2)
- E (new position 3, not 5)
- A (new position 4, not 3)
- M (new letter)

This tests B and M as new letters while respecting all constraints.

The board now tells us:

- R is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- M is in position 5 (✓)

So the word pattern is: _ R E A M

We only need the first letter.  
Excluded letters so far: S, L, T, C, N, B  
Common unused consonants: D, F, G, H, K, P, W, etc.

Common English 5-letter words that fit “_REAM”:
DREAM, FREAK (no), GREAT (T excluded), PREAM (not a word), CREAM (C excluded), etc.

Only DREAM fits all constraints.

Therefore the secret word must be DREAM.
