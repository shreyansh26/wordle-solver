For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify or eliminate many possibilities. Common first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words contain frequently used letters in English and vowels to quickly narrow down the possibilities. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good feedback on which letters are present or absent.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That removes a lot of possibilities, so we need to pick a word that avoids those letters entirely and still tests new, common letters.  
Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, F, H, G, B, K, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next choice should use several of these remaining common letters.  
A classic candidate that avoids A, R, O, S, E and contains frequently occurring consonants plus the vowel “I” is “UNITY”.  
Another strong option is “BLUNT”, but “UNITY” tests U, N, I, T, Y—five distinct letters that are all still possible and quite common.

Remaining letters to test should avoid A,R,O,S,E,Y and can include the still-possible letters plus I and T in new positions.

Common remaining consonants: D, L, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W
Common remaining vowels: I (already known to be somewhere), plus maybe I again or another vowel if repeated.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with UN and containing both I and T somewhere in positions 3-5 (since T was marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 4).

- UNFIT (tests F, I, T in new positions)

- UNBIT (invalid, B is ok but BIT may not be valid)
- UNHIP (tests H, I, P but doesn’t use T)

From the new feedback we now know:

1. Fixed letters in positions 1 and 2: U N _ _ _
2. Fixed letters in positions 3, 4 and 5: _ _ I T  
   (because the I and T are now in the correct spots)
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, Y, F  
   (from previous x marks plus the new F)

So the word must be U N I T _ (first four letters are locked as U N I T).

We just need a single fifth letter that:
- is NOT any of the already-eliminated letters A, R, O, S, E, Y, F
- is a valid 5-letter word ending in that letter.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, W  
Common remaining vowels: none left except possibly U or I (but U already appears once and double I is unusual).

The only obvious real word ending in U N I T + one more letter is “UNITS” but S is already eliminated. Next is “UNITE” – E eliminated. “UNITY” – Y eliminated. “UNITH” – not a word. “UNITD” – not a word. The only actual remaining valid word is:

UNIT + letter: UNIT plus G = “UNIGT” – not valid.  
Wait, let’s list all possible valid 5-letter words starting with UNIT:

- UNITE – contains E (eliminated)
- UNITS – contains S (eliminated)
- UNICA – contains C, A – A eliminated
- UNIFY – Y eliminated
- … after checking, the only remaining valid word is “UNHIP” – starts UN but H, I, P, but that doesn’t fit the pattern.

Actually we have positions 1-4 locked as U N I T. The only valid 5-letter word left that fits the pattern while avoiding all eliminated letters is “UNITH” which is not a recognized English word.

Wait, let’s double-check: positions 1-5 must be U N I T _. The only common valid word left is “UNITS” but S is eliminated. That implies we may have missed a candidate.

After carefully reviewing, the only valid English word remaining that fits all constraints is:

“UNITE” – but E is eliminated.  
“UNITS” – S eliminated.  
“UNITY” – Y eliminated.  
“UNICL” – not a word.

Oops, seems we missed a candidate. Let me re-express:

We have U N I T _ with _ not being A,R,O,S,E,Y,F. The remaining letters are B,C,D,G,H,K,L,M,P,W. The only real everyday word that ends in U N I T + one of these is:

“UNITS” – invalid (S eliminated)  
“UNITE” – invalid (E eliminated)  
“UNITH” – not a word  
“UNICD” – not a word  
“UNITG” – not a word  
“UNITP” – not a word  

Upon re-examining a dictionary, the actual valid word that fits is “UNHIP” but that doesn’t start with UNIT.

Wait, let’s be precise: we have the pattern U N I T _.

Valid English words:
- UNITS – S eliminated  
- UNITE – E eliminated  
- UNITY – Y eliminated  
- UNICA – A eliminated  
- UNIFY – Y eliminated  
- UNIL? – no  
- UNIQ? – Q not yet tested, but UNIQ is not 5 letters.

Realizing this, the only possibility left is “UNITH” but it’s not valid. This suggests we may have a mistake in earlier steps.

Rechecking: the feedback in Guess 3 was U(✓) N(✓) F(x) I(✓) T(✓). This means:
- U is correct in position 1  
- N is correct in position 2  
- I is correct in position 4  
- T is correct in position 5  
- F is not in the word

Therefore the pattern is U N _ I T.

We need a letter in position 3 that:
- is NOT A,R,O,S,E,Y,F  
- forms a valid word U N _ I T

Valid English words matching U N _ I T:
- U N B I T – not a word  
- U N C I T – not a word  
- U N D I T – not a word  
- U N G I T – not a word  
- U N H I T – not a word  
- U N K I T – not a word  
- U N L I T – YES, “UNLIT” is a valid word  
- U N M I T – not a word  
- U N P I T – not a word  
- U N W I T – no  

The only valid word remaining is “UNLIT”.

Let’s verify letters against eliminations:
U ✓ (correct)  
N ✓ (correct)  
L – not yet tested (not in eliminated list)  
I ✓ (correct)  
T ✓ (correct)  

All constraints satisfied.

Therefore the correct next guess is UNLIT.

<guess>UNLIT</guess>",UNLIT,"From the new feedback we now know:

1. Fixed letters in positions 1 and 2: U N _ _ _
2. Fixed letters in positions 3, 4 and 5: _ _ I T  
   (because the I and T are now in the correct spots)
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, Y, F  
   (from previous x marks plus the new F)

So the word must be U N I T _ (first four letters are locked as U N I T).

We just need a single fifth letter that:
- is NOT any of the already-eliminated letters A, R, O, S, E, Y, F
- is a valid 5-letter word ending in that letter.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, W  
Common remaining vowels: none left except possibly U or I (but U already appears once and double I is unusual).

The only obvious real word ending in U N I T + one more letter is “UNITS” but S is already eliminated. Next is “UNITE” – E eliminated. “UNITY” – Y eliminated. “UNITH” – not a word. “UNITD” – not a word. The only actual remaining valid word is:
