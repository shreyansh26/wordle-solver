This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good first word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize the information gained

Some popular first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". After evaluating these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- The letters are among the most common in English

However, ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes S which is very common in English. Between these, I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it has excellent letter coverage.

- Contains I (but not in position 3)
- Contains no R, S, or E

Good next guesses should test common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). One strong candidate is ""FAINT"":
- F is common
- A is correct in position 2
- I is present (and not in position 3)
- N and T are common consonants
- Contains no R, S, or E
- Contains no repeated letters

Another option could be ""HAIRY"" but Y is less common. ""PAINT"" is similar to FAINT but P is less common than F. ""GAIT"" is too short. So FAINT seems optimal.
