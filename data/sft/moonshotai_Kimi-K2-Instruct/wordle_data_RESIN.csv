Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, the best approach is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Common letters in English include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A typical good starting word might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Between these, ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - covering some of the most frequent letters and giving us a good chance to find vowels or consonants early.

""CRANE"" seems like a solid first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) → R is present but not in position 2
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-) → N is present but not in position 4
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) → E is present but not in position 5

So the word:
- does NOT contain C or A
- does contain R, N, E
- R is not in spot 2
- N is not in spot 4
- E is not in spot 5

We need a 5-letter word without C or A, but with R, N, E in positions other than those ruled out.

Looking for a new starting point, let’s try a word with common letters while keeping the constraints:
- try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- try N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4)
- try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

We can use T, I, S, L, M, etc. to fill other spots.

One possible word: ""INTER""
- letters: I, N, T, E, R
- contains R, N, E
- R is in position 5 (ok, as it was only excluded from 2)
- N is in position 2 (ok, as it was only excluded from 4)
- E is in position 4 (ok, as it was only excluded from 5)
- no C or A
This seems to fit all constraints.

Another possible word: ""TREND""
- letters: T, R, E, N, D
- but E would be in position 3 (ok), N in 4 (but N was excluded from position 4 in feedback) → invalid

""INERT"":
- I, N, E, R, T
- N in position 2, E in 3, R in 4 → all positions allowed
- no C or A → valid

Between INTER and INERT, both fit, but let's go with INTER as it tests I and T which are new letters.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, T

Constraints on positions:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 5 (from INTER) → R must be in 1, 3 or 4
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or 2 (from INTER) → N must be in 1, 3 or 5
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from INTER) → E must be in 1, 2 or 3
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INTER) → I must be in 2, 3, 4 or 5

We still need one more letter that is not C, A, T. Common remaining consonants: S, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters and one new consonant while satisfying all position constraints.

One way is:
- Put R in position 1
- Put N in position 3
- Put E in position 2
- Put I in position 4
- Add a new consonant S in position 5

That gives the word ""REINS"":
- R(1) ok, N(3) ok, E(2) ok, I(4) ok, S new letter
- All constraints satisfied

From the new feedback on REINS we now know:

- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 3).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 4).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 5).

So we have:

Position 1: R ✓
Position 2: E ✓
Position 3: must be I, N, or S (but NOT I which was wrong here)
Position 4: must be I, N, or S (but NOT N which was wrong here)
Position 5: must be I, N, or S (but NOT S which was wrong here)

Thus the word is: R E ? ? ? with the pool {I, N, S} to place in positions 3,4,5 without repeating the positions they’ve already been excluded from.

Let’s lay out possible placements:

- I cannot be in position 3 → so I must be in position 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 4 → so N must be in position 3 or 5.
- S cannot be in position 5 → so S must be in position 3 or 4.

We need one of each letter (no repeats) in the remaining three slots.

Try I in position 4:
Then:
- position 5 must be N or S. But S is allowed here (only excluded from 5, actually no restriction on S except not 5). Wait S cannot be in 5, so position 5 must be N.
- Then position 3 must be S.

This gives: R E S I N → ""RESIN""
Check constraints:
- I not in 3 (ok, it's in 4)
- N not in 4 (ok, it's in 5)
- S not in 5 (ok, it's in 3)
All constraints satisfied.
