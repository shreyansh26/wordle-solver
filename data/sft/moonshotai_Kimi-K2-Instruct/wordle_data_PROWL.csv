For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequent consonants, to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (a very common consonant)
- L (another common consonant)
- A (the most common vowel)
- T (a top consonant)
- E (the most common letter overall)

This word balances vowels and consonants and covers high-frequency letters, giving good feedback on what's in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S, A, T, E are NOT in the word (marked with x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2 but must be elsewhere).

With those constraints we know:
1. The word contains L.
2. The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
3. L cannot be in position 2.

The other letters (positions 1,3,4,5) need to be filled with letters that haven't been ruled out and that might help identify more of the word.

I’ll pick a new word that:
- Uses L in a different position (not position 2).
- Avoids S, A, T, E.
- Introduces new common letters (like R, I, N, O, U, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""FLING"":
- F, L, I, N, G are all still possible letters.
- L moves to position 2 (originally it was at position 2 in SLATE, so it must move elsewhere; placing it at position 2 again would be invalid; actually, let me correct this: L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked ""-"", so it must be in a different position. ""FLING"" places L in position 2, which is invalid. Let me choose a word where L is not in position 2.)

Let me revise: ""CLING"":
- C, L, I, N, G are all possible.
- L is in position 2 → still invalid (same issue).

""PLINK"":
- P, L, I, N, K are possible.
- L is in position 2 → invalid.

""GUILD"":
- G, U, I, L, D are possible.

From the three rounds of feedback we have:

1. Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, G, U, I, D, B, C, K  
2. Known letters:  
   - L must appear somewhere in the word (marked “–” three times), but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (those were marked “–” in SLATE, GUILD, and BLOCK, respectively).  
   - O is in position 3 (marked ✓).  
3. Remaining positions for L: 1 or 5.  

We need a five-letter word that:
- has O in position 3
- contains L exactly once, in position 1 or 5
- uses only letters not yet eliminated (so far: F, H, J, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels—only O is confirmed and used, A, E, I, U already eliminated)

A quick scan of common patterns:  
- If L is in position 1, we need _ _ O _ _ with L _ O _ _.  
- If L is in position 5, we need _ _ O _ L.

Let’s test the position-5 option first because it offers more consonant-vowel combinations in the remaining spots.  
Valid letters left and still allowed: F, H, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y (and O already locked at pos 3).

Candidate words fitting _ _ O _ L:  
FROWL – but W is allowed; let’s check dictionary validity: FROWL isn’t standard.  
PROWL – P, R, O, W, L are all allowed letters and none have been eliminated.  
Check each letter: P, R, W remain in play; O is confirmed at position 3; L at 5 fits constraints.

Therefore, PROWL is a valid next guess.
