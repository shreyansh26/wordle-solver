- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No duplicate letters to maximize information

Some popular first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, STARE, LEAST, AUDIO, etc. Among these, SLATE is considered very strong because it covers:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (another fairly common letter)

This gives us good coverage across different letter types and positions. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

From the feedback for SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (S ≠ 1st letter).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (L = 2nd letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (A = 3rd letter).
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L A _ _
- Letters to use again: S (but not in 1st position), L, A
- Letters to avoid: T, E

Next guess should:
1. Keep L and A fixed in positions 2 and 3.
2. Re-use S but place it in a new position (positions 3,4,5 since 1 is S- and 2,3 are LA).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels (avoiding T, E).

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, P, M, G, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is already used and E is out).

Candidate words: CLASP (invalid, T is not there but S is already in wrong place), GLAND, PLANS, SLANG (invalid, S is still 1st), etc.

A strong candidate: **CLANK** (but K isn't very common), **PLANK**, **BLANK**, **GLAND**.

I'll choose **BLANK** because:
- B, N, K are good consonants to test.
- N is common in 4th/5th positions.
- K is less common but still possible.

However, **PLANK** might be even better because P is common and N is good. Wait, actually **GLAND** has D which is also a good consonant.

Actually, **CLASP** is invalid since it has S in 5th position and we know S is in the word but not in 1st - this could be valid. But S in 5th is possible.

But the best might be **PLANS** - P, N, S are all good and we can fit S in 5th.

Wait, let me think differently: positions 1,4,5 need filling. S must be in 4 or 5. 

Option 1: _ L A S _ 
Possible words: CLASH (invalid, H is new), FLASH (invalid, H), PLASM (not common), GLASS (duplicate S).

Option 2: _ L A _ S
Possible words: CLASS (C,L,A,S,S - duplicate S), GLASS (duplicate), BLAST (invalid T), CLAPS (invalid P,S are good), FLAPS (invalid F).

Actually, **CLASP** seems good - C,L,A,S,P. S is in 4th (allowed), P is new. This gives us C,P,S to test.

But **PLANS** is simpler - P,L,A,N,S. All new letters except L,A,S.

I'll go with **PLANS** as it gives us P,N,S and fits the pattern.

Wait, **PLANS** has S in 5th which is allowed. 

But another good one: **FLANK** - F,L,A,N,K. 

Actually **PLANK** seems very good - P,L,A,N,K. 

However, let's prioritize high-frequency letters. **C** is very high frequency. 

Between CLASP and PLANS, CLASP gives us C and P. 

But CLASP has S in 4th which is allowed (S not in 1st). 

I think **CLASP** is the best next guess.
