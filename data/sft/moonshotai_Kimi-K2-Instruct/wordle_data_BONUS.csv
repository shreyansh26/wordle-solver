For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. We want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

After considering options, the word ""AROSE"" comes to mind because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words
- No repeating letters, maximizing the chance to test multiple unique letters

This should give good feedback about which of these 5 common letters are present in the secret word.

The feedback from AROSE:
- A: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)  
- O: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: - (in word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in word)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 & 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E
- We need a word that has O and S but avoids A/R/E, and moves O/S to new positions

Looking at remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, U, etc. Since we know O and S are present, we need to place them in different positions and fill the rest with new letters.

A good next guess would be something like ""SOUND"":
- Contains S (known to be in word)
- Contains O (known to be in word)  
- Uses new letters U, N, D that we haven't tested yet
- Positions O and S differently from their original positions

However, ""SOUND"" might be better as it tests new letters while incorporating our known letters. Alternatively, ""STONY"" would test T/N/Y. But I'll go with ""SOUND"" as it maximizes new letter testing.

Wait, let's verify:
- SOUND: S (position 1), O (position 2) - this moves O from position 3→2 and S from 4→1, both are new positions

Let's consolidate what we now know after the first three guesses:

Known letters and positions:
- O is definitely in position 2 (✓ in both SOUND and FOIST).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SOUND and FOIST feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.
- A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T are NOT in the word.

Template so far:
_ O _ _ S   (with O locked in position 2 and S locked in position 5)

Remaining untested common letters: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y (vowels A, E, I, U already excluded).

We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 3, and one vowel or consonant for position 4. The only remaining vowel-like letter is Y (since A,E,I,O,U are all accounted for), but Y can act as a vowel.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ O _ _ S with remaining letters, let's try:
- ""LOCKS"" – but K is untested and L is in word
- ""MOCKS"" – tests M, C, K
- ""HOLKS"" (though less common) – tests H, L, K

But we want to test as many new letters as possible. The most common-looking word seems ""MOCKS"":
- M, C, K are all new letters
- Fits _ O C K S perfectly

However, position 3 could be any of the remaining letters. To be systematic, let's test a word that maximizes new letter coverage.

Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" – but we need _ _ _ _ S.

Wait, our template is fixed to _ O _ _ S. So positions 1,3,4 need filling with new letters.

Let's test ""BLOWS"":
- B, L, W are new letters
- Fits B L O W S – but wait this would put O in position 3 which we know it's position 2.

Oops, mistake - our template is _ O _ _ S (position 2 is O, position 5 is S).

So positions 1,3,4 need filling. Let's try ""COBBS"" – but B repeats, and we want unique letters.

Better choice: ""CLOYS"":
- C, L, Y are new
- Fits C L O Y S – but this would put O in position 3, not 2. Wrong.

Correct template: position 1, then O in 2, then positions 3,4, then S in 5.

Thus word shape: X O Y Z S

Best choice: ""CONKS"" – but N is already out (from SOUND).

Next: ""BOGUS"" – but U is out.

""COGYS"" – but Y is last letter, C,O,G,Y,S – but we don't know if Y is valid.

""COBBS"" – B repeats.

Looking carefully, the most straightforward word to test new letters while fitting _ O _ _ S is ""MOCKS"" – but position 4 is K, and we've not tested K.

Actually, simpler: ""WOCKS"" – but W untested and O is position 2, so W O C K S.

But ""WOCKS"" isn't common. Let's pick ""POCKS"":
- P, C, K are new
- Fits P O C K S

This seems valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BONUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. We want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

After considering options, the word ""AROSE"" comes to mind because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words
- No repeating letters, maximizing the chance to test multiple unique letters

This should give good feedback about which of these 5 common letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
- A: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)  
- O: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: - (in word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in word)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 & 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E
- We need a word that has O and S but avoids A/R/E, and moves O/S to new positions

Looking at remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, U, etc. Since we know O and S are present, we need to place them in different positions and fill the rest with new letters.

A good next guess would be something like ""SOUND"":
- Contains S (known to be in word)
- Contains O (known to be in word)  
- Uses new letters U, N, D that we haven't tested yet
- Positions O and S differently from their original positions

However, ""SOUND"" might be better as it tests new letters while incorporating our known letters. Alternatively, ""STONY"" would test T/N/Y. But I'll go with ""SOUND"" as it maximizes new letter testing.

Wait, let's verify:
- SOUND: S (position 1), O (position 2) - this moves O from position 3→2 and S from 4→1, both are new positions
- Letters used: S, O, U, N, D - all new except S/O which we know are in the word

2. O is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).
3. S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 4 (the two places we have tried it).  
   Hence S must be in position 3 or 5.
4. We still need to test common remaining consonants / vowels: T, I, L, C, K, Y, etc.

So far our template looks like:
_ O _ _ _  (with O locked in position 2)

Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps O in position 2,  
- puts S in either position 3 or 5,  
- uses three fresh letters we haven’t tested yet.

Candidate: “FOIST”
- F, I, T are new letters.
- O is in place.
- S is tried in position 3 (a new spot for S).

That should efficiently test three new letters while respecting everything we know.

We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 3, and one vowel or consonant for position 4. The only remaining vowel-like letter is Y (since A,E,I,O,U are all accounted for), but Y can act as a vowel.

- Fits _ O C K S perfectly

However, position 3 could be any of the remaining letters. To be systematic, let's test a word that maximizes new letter coverage.

Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" – but we need _ _ _ _ S.

Wait, our template is fixed to _ O _ _ S. So positions 1,3,4 need filling with new letters.

Let's test ""BLOWS"":
- B, L, W are new letters
- Fits B L O W S – but wait this would put O in position 3 which we know it's position 2.

Oops, mistake - our template is _ O _ _ S (position 2 is O, position 5 is S).

So positions 1,3,4 need filling. Let's try ""COBBS"" – but B repeats, and we want unique letters.

Better choice: ""CLOYS"":
- C, L, Y are new
- Fits C L O Y S – but this would put O in position 3, not 2. Wrong.

Correct template: position 1, then O in 2, then positions 3,4, then S in 5.

Thus word shape: X O Y Z S

Best choice: ""CONKS"" – but N is already out (from SOUND).

Next: ""BOGUS"" – but U is out.

""COGYS"" – but Y is last letter, C,O,G,Y,S – but we don't know if Y is valid.

""COBBS"" – B repeats.

Looking carefully, the most straightforward word to test new letters while fitting _ O _ _ S is ""MOCKS"" – but position 4 is K, and we've not tested K.

Actually, simpler: ""WOCKS"" – but W untested and O is position 2, so W O C K S.

But ""WOCKS"" isn't common. Let's pick ""POCKS"":
- P, C, K are new
- Fits P O C K S

This seems valid.From the feedback we now have:

- Word structure: _ O _ _ S  
  (O locked at position 2, S locked at position 5)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T
- Remaining common untested letters: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y

Current confirmed information:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2 = O (✓ in every guess since guess 2)
   - Position 5 = S (✓ from guess 4)

2. Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):
   A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T, P, C, K

3. S appears only in position 5, so it cannot appear anywhere else.

4. Still-untested common letters: B, G, H, L, M, Y, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form _ O _ _ S that uses only the remaining letters above for positions 1, 3, and 4.

Scanning through common patterns:
- Position 1: must be one of {B, G, H, L, M, Y, W}
- Position 3: same pool

Some possibilities:
- B O G G S (invalid, repeats G)

Looking carefully, let's try ""BOGUS"" – but U is eliminated.

Next is ""GLOBS"" – but G, L, O, B, S – O and S are fixed positions, but B is new.

Wait, ""GLOBS"" would be G L O B S, but our template is _ O _ _ S, position 2 is O and 5 is S, so positions 1,3,4.

So word shape: 1 O 3 4 S.

Looking for real words:
- B O G Y S – but Y is ok, but is this a word? Not common.

Another is ""BOOMS"" – but O repeats and M is ok, but OO and M is position 4 – but position 2 is already O, so it would be B O O M S – but this repeats O in position 3 which is allowed, but is it a word? Yes, ""BOOMS"" is valid.

But does it fit our template? B O O M S – positions: 1=B, 2=O, 3=O, 4=M, 5=S. This fits _ O _ _ S.

Letters used: B, O, M – all are not eliminated (B and M are new).

Let's check elimination list: B and M are not in the eliminated list (A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T, P, C, K).

So ""BOOMS"" seems a valid next guess.

Another candidate is ""HOLMS"" – but L is ok, M is ok, H is ok.

But ""BOOMS"" is more common.

Also ""HOMES"" – but E eliminated.

""LOOMS"" – L, O, O, M, S – but L is new, O and S are fixed. This also works.

But ""BOOMS"" tests B, O, M.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BONUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. We want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

After considering options, the word ""AROSE"" comes to mind because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words
- No repeating letters, maximizing the chance to test multiple unique letters

This should give good feedback about which of these 5 common letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
- A: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)  
- O: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: - (in word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in word)

So we know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 & 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E
- We need a word that has O and S but avoids A/R/E, and moves O/S to new positions

Looking at remaining common consonants and vowels, good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, U, etc. Since we know O and S are present, we need to place them in different positions and fill the rest with new letters.

A good next guess would be something like ""SOUND"":
- Contains S (known to be in word)
- Contains O (known to be in word)  
- Uses new letters U, N, D that we haven't tested yet
- Positions O and S differently from their original positions

However, ""SOUND"" might be better as it tests new letters while incorporating our known letters. Alternatively, ""STONY"" would test T/N/Y. But I'll go with ""SOUND"" as it maximizes new letter testing.

Wait, let's verify:
- SOUND: S (position 1), O (position 2) - this moves O from position 3→2 and S from 4→1, both are new positions
- Letters used: S, O, U, N, D - all new except S/O which we know are in the word

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we now know:

1. A, R, E, U, N, D are NOT in the word.
2. O is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).
3. S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 4 (the two places we have tried it).  
   Hence S must be in position 3 or 5.
4. We still need to test common remaining consonants / vowels: T, I, L, C, K, Y, etc.

So far our template looks like:
_ O _ _ _  (with O locked in position 2)

Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps O in position 2,  
- puts S in either position 3 or 5,  
- uses three fresh letters we haven’t tested yet.

Candidate: “FOIST”
- F, I, T are new letters.
- O is in place.
- S is tried in position 3 (a new spot for S).

That should efficiently test three new letters while respecting everything we know.

<guess>FOIST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we now know after the first three guesses:

Known letters and positions:
- O is definitely in position 2 (✓ in both SOUND and FOIST).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SOUND and FOIST feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.
- A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T are NOT in the word.

Template so far:
_ O _ _ S   (with O locked in position 2 and S locked in position 5)

Remaining untested common letters: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y (vowels A, E, I, U already excluded).

We need two more consonants for positions 1 and 3, and one vowel or consonant for position 4. The only remaining vowel-like letter is Y (since A,E,I,O,U are all accounted for), but Y can act as a vowel.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ O _ _ S with remaining letters, let's try:
- ""LOCKS"" – but K is untested and L is in word
- ""MOCKS"" – tests M, C, K
- ""HOLKS"" (though less common) – tests H, L, K

But we want to test as many new letters as possible. The most common-looking word seems ""MOCKS"":
- M, C, K are all new letters
- Fits _ O C K S perfectly

However, position 3 could be any of the remaining letters. To be systematic, let's test a word that maximizes new letter coverage.

Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" – but we need _ _ _ _ S.

Wait, our template is fixed to _ O _ _ S. So positions 1,3,4 need filling with new letters.

Let's test ""BLOWS"":
- B, L, W are new letters
- Fits B L O W S – but wait this would put O in position 3 which we know it's position 2.

Oops, mistake - our template is _ O _ _ S (position 2 is O, position 5 is S).

So positions 1,3,4 need filling. Let's try ""COBBS"" – but B repeats, and we want unique letters.

Better choice: ""CLOYS"":
- C, L, Y are new
- Fits C L O Y S – but this would put O in position 3, not 2. Wrong.

Correct template: position 1, then O in 2, then positions 3,4, then S in 5.

Thus word shape: X O Y Z S

Best choice: ""CONKS"" – but N is already out (from SOUND).

Next: ""BOGUS"" – but U is out.

""COGYS"" – but Y is last letter, C,O,G,Y,S – but we don't know if Y is valid.

""COBBS"" – B repeats.

Looking carefully, the most straightforward word to test new letters while fitting _ O _ _ S is ""MOCKS"" – but position 4 is K, and we've not tested K.

Actually, simpler: ""WOCKS"" – but W untested and O is position 2, so W O C K S.

But ""WOCKS"" isn't common. Let's pick ""POCKS"":
- P, C, K are new
- Fits P O C K S

This seems valid.From the feedback we now have:

- Word structure: _ O _ _ S  
  (O locked at position 2, S locked at position 5)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T
- Remaining common untested letters: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y

A first check of the pattern _ O _ _ S gives the common word **POCKS**, which uses three new letters (P, C, K) and fits the known positions.

Current definite facts:
- Positions: 1 = B, 2 = O, 5 = S
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, E, U, N, D, F, I, T, P, C, K, M
- Remaining untested letters: G, H, L, V, W, Y, and any others not yet used
- Pattern: B O _ _ S (positions 1,2,5 fixed)

From BOOMS feedback:
- O appears twice: once in correct position 2 (✓) and once in position 3 where it is in the word but wrong position (-)
- This means the word contains exactly TWO O's: one in position 2 and one more somewhere else (positions 3 or 4)

So word structure: B O O _ S or B O _ O S

We need to pick the correct letter for position 3 or 4 using remaining allowed letters.

Possible remaining letters: G, H, L, V, W, Y

We need a common 5-letter word that fits:
- BOO _ S (position 4 needs a letter)
- BO _ OS (position 3 needs a letter)

Looking at real English words:

- BOO H S → BOOHS (not common)
- BOO L S → BOOLS (valid, but maybe not common)
- BOO Y S → BOOYS (not a word)

- BO L OS → BOLOS (not common)
- BO V OS → BOVOS (not a word)
- BO W OS → BOWOS (not a word)
- BO Y OS → BOYOS (not common)

The most plausible common word fitting is BOLOS, but that seems less common than BOHOS.

Actually, BOHOS is a valid plural of ""boho"" (bohemian), which is recognized.

Between BOLOS and BOHOS, BOHOS appears more commonly accepted.
