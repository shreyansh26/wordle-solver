For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N).
2. These letters appear frequently in English 5-letter words.
3. It's a good balance between consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities quickly.

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions early on.

So far we know:
- A is in the correct position (3rd place).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, N, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd spot.
- Contains R somewhere other than the 2nd spot.
- Does NOT contain C, N, E.

Let me list some possibilities that fit those rules:
- DRAFT (A in 3rd, R in 2nd but feedback says R is not in 2nd – so this is invalid)
- TRASH (A in 3rd, R in 4th – valid)
- GRASP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRAIL (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRAMP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- BRAND (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- DRAMA (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRADE (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRANK (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)

- R (must be in word, and here it's in 4th position, not 2nd)
- A (correct position, 3rd)
- S (new letter)

This introduces four new letters (T, S, H) while keeping A fixed and testing R in a new spot. It maximizes new info while respecting the constraints.

Current knowledge:

4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

- Does NOT contain C, N, E.

Let me list some possibilities that fit those rules:
- DRAFT (A in 3rd, R in 2nd but feedback says R is not in 2nd – so this is invalid)
- TRASH (A in 3rd, R in 4th – valid)
- GRASP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRAIL (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRAMP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- BRAND (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- DRAMA (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRADE (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRANK (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRASH"" fits perfectly:
- T (new letter)
- R (must be in word, and here it's in 4th position, not 2nd)
- A (correct position, 3rd)
- S (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This introduces four new letters (T, S, H) while keeping A fixed and testing R in a new spot. It maximizes new info while respecting the constraints.

- A is locked in the 3rd position.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: C, N, E, T, S, H.

Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Places A in the 3rd spot.
2. Contains R in either the 1st or 5th spot.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, N, E, T, S, H).
4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate letters left: A, B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try R in position 1:
- R _ A _ _

Popular patterns:
- R A _ _ _ → but A must be 3rd
- R _ A _ _

Possible words:
- R B A I D (invalid: B, I, D are fine but word doesn’t exist or is uncommon)
- R O A D S (invalid: S forbidden)
- R O A M S (invalid: S forbidden)
- R A I N S (invalid: A not 3rd, N/S forbidden)
- R A Z O R (invalid: A not 3rd)
- R A M P S (invalid: P/S okay but S forbidden)
- R A M P A (invalid: A not 3rd)

Instead, let's try R in position 5:
- _ _ A _ R

Possible words:
- B A K E R (invalid: E forbidden)
- M A J O R (invalid: O/J allowed but O is okay, J uncommon)
- F A M I R (invalid: not a word)
- G L A D R (invalid: not a word)
- P A I R _ (invalid: R must be 5th)
- G R A P E (invalid: E forbidden, R not 5th)
- V A P O R (invalid: O allowed but P/O allowed, but we’ve already ruled out O not yet)
- F A V O R (invalid: O allowed, but we haven't ruled out O yet)
- D R A W L (invalid: A not 3rd)

Wait, let me reconsider: we haven’t ruled out O yet.

""FAVOR"":
- F, A, V, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No C, N, E, T, S, H - ✓
- All letters new except A and R.

""MAJOR"":
- M, A, J, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No forbidden letters - ✓
- But J is less common.

""VALOR"":
- V, A, L, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No forbidden letters - ✓

Between these, ""VALOR"" uses very common letters (V, A, L, O, R) and gives maximum info.

Check: V, A, L, O, R - none of C,N,E,T,S,H. A is 3rd, R is 5th (allowed positions). ""VALOR"" is a valid word.

So far we know:

- A is fixed in position 3.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 1 (from CRANE, TRASH, VALOR, BRAID).  
  That leaves only position 3 … but A is already there.  
  Therefore R must actually NOT be in the word at all.

But the feedback from every guess has been “R(-)”, which means R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
The apparent contradiction tells us we must have mis-read one of the earlier clues.

Double-check:
- CRANE → R(-)  (R exists, wrong spot)
- TRASH → R(-)  (R exists, wrong spot)
- VALOR → R(-)  (R exists, wrong spot)
- BRAID → R(-)  (R exists, wrong spot)

Positions already tried for R: 2, 4, 5, 1.  
Therefore the only spot left is position 3, but A is already there.  
This implies the secret word does **not** contain R at all, despite every “R(-)” feedback.  
That can only happen if the “R(-)” feedback was a typo in the prompt, or the feedback convention differs.

Interpreting strictly, we must act as if R is still required to be in the word, so there is no place left to put it.  
The simplest resolution is that the true feedback for VALOR should have been R(x) instead of R(-); otherwise no solution exists.

Assuming the feedback **VALOR: R(x)** (i.e., R is **not** in the word), the constraints become:

- A is in position 3 (✓).
- R is **NOT** in the word.
- Forbidden letters: C, N, E, T, S, H, V, L, O, R, B, I, D.

Valid letters still free: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Searching for viable words under these constraints:

“MAGMA”:

- A is in position 3
- No forbidden letters appear
- It is a valid 5-letter word

Hence, the optimal next guess under the corrected constraints is “MAGMA”.
</think>

The only consistent conclusion is that R must actually **not** be in the word, so the feedback for VALOR (and possibly earlier) likely had a typo.  
Proceeding with that correction, the word must contain A in position 3 and must **not** contain: C, N, E, T, S, H, V, L, O, R, B, I, D.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N).
2. These letters appear frequently in English 5-letter words.
3. It's a good balance between consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities quickly.

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions early on.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- A is in the correct position (3rd place).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, N, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd spot.
- Contains R somewhere other than the 2nd spot.
- Does NOT contain C, N, E.

Let me list some possibilities that fit those rules:
- DRAFT (A in 3rd, R in 2nd but feedback says R is not in 2nd – so this is invalid)
- TRASH (A in 3rd, R in 4th – valid)
- GRASP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRAIL (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRAMP (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- BRAND (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- DRAMA (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- TRADE (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)
- FRANK (A in 3rd, R in 2nd – invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRASH"" fits perfectly:
- T (new letter)
- R (must be in word, and here it's in 4th position, not 2nd)
- A (correct position, 3rd)
- S (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This introduces four new letters (T, S, H) while keeping A fixed and testing R in a new spot. It maximizes new info while respecting the constraints.

- A is locked in the 3rd position.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: C, N, E, T, S, H.

Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Places A in the 3rd spot.
2. Contains R in either the 1st or 5th spot.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, N, E, T, S, H).
4. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate letters left: A, B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try R in position 1:
- R _ A _ _

Popular patterns:
- R A _ _ _ → but A must be 3rd
- R _ A _ _

Possible words:
- R B A I D (invalid: B, I, D are fine but word doesn’t exist or is uncommon)
- R O A D S (invalid: S forbidden)
- R O A M S (invalid: S forbidden)
- R A I N S (invalid: A not 3rd, N/S forbidden)
- R A Z O R (invalid: A not 3rd)
- R A M P S (invalid: P/S okay but S forbidden)
- R A M P A (invalid: A not 3rd)

Instead, let's try R in position 5:
- _ _ A _ R

Possible words:
- B A K E R (invalid: E forbidden)
- M A J O R (invalid: O/J allowed but O is okay, J uncommon)
- F A M I R (invalid: not a word)
- G L A D R (invalid: not a word)
- P A I R _ (invalid: R must be 5th)
- G R A P E (invalid: E forbidden, R not 5th)
- V A P O R (invalid: O allowed but P/O allowed, but we’ve already ruled out O not yet)
- F A V O R (invalid: O allowed, but we haven't ruled out O yet)
- D R A W L (invalid: A not 3rd)

Wait, let me reconsider: we haven’t ruled out O yet.

""FAVOR"":
- F, A, V, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No C, N, E, T, S, H - ✓
- All letters new except A and R.

""MAJOR"":
- M, A, J, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No forbidden letters - ✓
- But J is less common.

""VALOR"":
- V, A, L, O, R
- A is 3rd - ✓
- R is 5th - ✓
- No forbidden letters - ✓

Between these, ""VALOR"" uses very common letters (V, A, L, O, R) and gives maximum info.

Check: V, A, L, O, R - none of C,N,E,T,S,H. A is 3rd, R is 5th (allowed positions). ""VALOR"" is a valid word.

Thus, best next guess is ""VALOR"".

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. A must be in the 3rd position (from CRANE: A = ✓).
2. R must appear in the word but **cannot** be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from CRANE, TRASH, VALOR feedback).
   - Only remaining spot for R is position 1.
3. Forbidden letters so far: C, N, E, T, S, H, V, L, O.
4. Therefore the word looks like: R _ A _ _

Letters still allowed (and common): B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to pick a valid word with pattern R _ A _ _ that uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words fitting R _ A _ _:
- R B A I D  (but ""BRAID"" uses I and D)
- R D A I N  (but N is forbidden)
- R F A I L  (but F and I are allowed)
- R M A I D  (""MAID"" is 4 letters)
- R P A I R  (but R already used at start)
- R G A I N  (but N is forbidden)
- R F A I R  (""RF AIR"" not a word)
- R B A K E  (but E is forbidden)

The most common valid word left is ""BRAID"":
- B, R, A, I, D
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (correct)
- B, I, D are new letters and not forbidden
- ""BRAID"" is a valid English word

Let's check:
- B: new
- R: position 1 (allowed)
- A: position 3 (correct)

- D: new

  Therefore R must actually NOT be in the word at all.

But the feedback from every guess has been “R(-)”, which means R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
The apparent contradiction tells us we must have mis-read one of the earlier clues.

- CRANE → R(-)  (R exists, wrong spot)

Let’s carefully re-examine every piece of feedback.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is locked in position 3.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.

2. TRASH → T(x) R(-) A(✓) S(x) H(x)  
   – Still A in position 3.  
   – R is still required; it is **not** in position 4.

3. VALOR → V(x) A(-) L(x) O(x) R(-)  
   – A is NOT in position 3 this time, contradicting earlier feedback.  
   – This single line must contain a typo; treating it as **A(✓)** keeps everything consistent.  
   – R(-) again says R exists and is **not** in position 5.

4. BRAID → B(x) R(-) A(✓) I(x) D(✓)  
   – A remains in position 3.  
   – R is **not** in position 1.  

5. MAGMA → M(x) A(-) G(x) M(x) A(-)  
   – Again the feedback says A(-), which would contradict the first four clues.  
   – If we take the first four clues literally, A is fixed in position 3.  
   – Under that strict reading, MAGMA’s feedback should have been A(✓), so the line with MAGMA must be a typo.

Therefore, the **only internally consistent reading** of the entire history is:

- A is in position 3.  
- R is required and must appear, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 or 5.  
- There is **no remaining position** left for R.  

The puzzle as stated is impossible under standard Wordle rules.  
The feedback given for VALOR or MAGMA is inconsistent with earlier feedback.

Because the host clearly intended A to be in position 3 (it was ✓ in CRANE, TRASH, and BRAID), the only reasonable assumption is that the MAGMA line simply mis-typed the A feedback and it should be A(✓).

So the correct constraints are:

- A is fixed in position 3.  
- R must be somewhere, but every slot is already ruled out → contradiction.  

Hence there is **no 5-letter word** that satisfies all feedback exactly as written.  

To provide a useful next guess, we must assume **one instance of the A(-) feedback is a typo** and that **A is indeed in position 3**.  
With that correction, the letters still allowed are:  
Allowed: F, G, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y, Z  
Forbidden: C, N, E, T, S, H, V, L, O, R, B, I, D  

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

A valid English word with this pattern and only allowed letters is:

KAPOK → K, A, P, O, K  
But O is forbidden.

PAJAM → P, A, J, A, M

Letters: P, A, J, A, M  
- A is in position 3 (✓)  
- No forbidden letters appear  
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (variant of “pajama” without final A).
