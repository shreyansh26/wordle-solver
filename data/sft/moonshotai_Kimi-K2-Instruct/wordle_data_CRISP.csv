For the first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and can give me good information about the secret word. I'll use the strategy of picking a word with common vowels and consonants. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, S, T, R, etc.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I think ""STARE"" is a particularly strong first guess because it uses five of the most common letters in English words and positions them strategically. This should give us good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on STARE:

S(-) – S is in the word but not at position 1  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all  
A(x) – A is not in the word at all  
R(-) – R is in the word but not at position 4  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all  

So our constraints so far:
- Letters S and R must appear somewhere (but not at positions 1 and 4 respectively).
- Letters T, A, E are ruled out.

Good letters still available (and worth trying):  
Commonly occurring consonants: N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.  
Vowels still possible: I, O, U  

Given that R cannot be in the 4th slot and S cannot be in the 1st slot, I want a word that places R and S in new positions and also tests fresh letters.

One candidate: “ROSIN”  
- R at slot 2 (allowed, since R can’t only be at slot 4)  
- O (new vowel)  
- S at slot 3 (allowed, since S can’t only be at slot 1)  
- I (new vowel)  
- N (new consonant)

This tests new vowels O and I, consonant N, and moves S and R to new positions.

Let’s extract every constraint we now have.

1. From STARE:
   - S exists but is NOT in slot 1.
   - T is absent.
   - A is absent.
   - R exists but is NOT in slot 4.
   - E is absent.

2. From ROSIN:
   - R exists but is NOT in slot 1 (new constraint).
   - O is absent.
   - S exists but is NOT in slot 3 (new constraint).
   - I exists but is NOT in slot 4.
   - N is absent.

So the certain letters are: S, R, I (all must appear).
Forbidden positions:
   - S may not be in 1 or 3.
   - R may not be in 1 or 4.
   - I may not be in 4.

Other letters known absent: T, A, E, O, N.

Plausible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
Plausible remaining vowels: U (only vowel we haven’t tested).

We need a 5-letter word that
- contains S, R, I once each,
- satisfies the positional bans above,
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try to construct such a word systematically.

Slot analysis:
- Slot 1: cannot be S or R. Could be C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
- Slot 2: cannot be R (no ban yet) and cannot be S (no ban yet). Could be any of S, R, I, or new letters.
- Slot 3: cannot be S. Could be many choices.
- Slot 4: cannot be R or I. Could be S or new letters.
- Slot 5: no bans yet.

A convenient pattern is to place I somewhere early, R somewhere late but not at 4, and S somewhere late but not at 3.

Candidate word: CRISP
- C (slot 1) – allowed.
- R (slot 2) – allowed (no ban on R at 2).
- I (slot 3) – allowed.
- S (slot 4) – allowed (S only banned from 1 and 3).
- P (slot 5) – allowed.

This word uses only letters not ruled out and obeys all observed constraints.
