For the first guess, I don't have any prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

Considering these points, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- It can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present
- The letter positions are designed to test common patterns

What we learned from the two guesses:

1. Letters **not** in the secret word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R (and position 5 is not E).
2. The letter **E** is in the word somewhere, but it is **not** in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it was marked “-” in those positions).
3. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Next goal: choose a word that
- contains E in a new position (1, 2, or 3),
- uses only previously untested letters,
- and uses other common consonants to gain maximum information.

Good remaining common letters: N, I, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, Y, W.

E (must be in position 1 or 2, since positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out)  
I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, since position 3 has been ruled out)  
D (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, since position 3 has been ruled out)

So the secret word contains E, I, D and two more letters from the still-untested pool.  
Still-unused common consonants: N, F, K, B, U, W, Y, P, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- includes E, I, D  
- places E in position 1 or 2  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out

Candidate words:  
- If E is in position 1 → EDI** → e.g., EDIFY  
- If E is in position 2 → ?  
EDIFY fits (E1, D2, I3, F4, Y5) and uses only fresh letters.",Guess 4: EDIFY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) D(✓) I(✓) F(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
