Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common English letters to help identify which letters are in the word
2. Has good letter diversity to maximize information gain
3. Uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

A strong starting word should include common vowels and consonants. Some excellent options are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

So far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, A, I, S, E, N, D
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: B, O, U

We know the word contains B, O, and U, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in BOUND:
- B was in position 1 → it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- O was in position 2 → it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- U was in position 3 → it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses B, O, and U, avoids R, A, I, S, E, N, D, and places these letters in different positions.

Available consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: O, U (already must be used)

I'll try a word that rearranges B, O, U and adds two more unused consonants. A good candidate is ""COBUX"" but that's not a valid English word. Let's think of real words:

- BUMPY
- BURLY (but R is invalid)
- BUSHY (but S and H are invalid)
- BUGLY (not a word)
- BULGY (not common)
- BOUGH (but G and H are allowed)
- BOUGH is a valid word (B-O-U-G-H), but we know U is not in position 3, so this would place U correctly in position 3 → invalid
- BOGUS (but S is invalid)
- BOOMY (but M and Y are allowed, O is repeated - possible)
- BUMPY (B-U-M-P-Y): checks positions:
  - B is in position 1 (but we know B cannot be in position 1) → invalid
- COMBY (not a word)
- GLOUB (not a word)
- TOUGH (but T, G, H are allowed)
- TOUGH: T-O-U-G-H
  - T in position 1 (allowed)
  - O in position 2 (but we know O cannot be in position 2 from BOUND) → invalid
- YOUTH (but Y, T, H allowed)
  - Y-O-U-T-H
  - O in position 2 again → invalid
- GLOUT (not a word)
- CLOUT (but C, L, T allowed)
  - C-L-O-U-T
  - O is in position 3 (allowed, since BOUND had O in position 2)
  - U is in position 4 (allowed, since BOUND had U in position 3)

CLOUT seems valid:
- Contains O and U
- Contains C, L, T (all new letters)
- O is in position 3 (allowed)
- U is in position 4 (allowed)
- No R, A, I, S, E, N, D

Another candidate: COBLY (but not a word)

CUBBY: but B is repeated
COMBO: but M, B allowed, O repeated, but B is in position 4 (allowed), O in positions 1 and 3 (allowed)

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, A, I, S, E, N, D
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: B, O, U

We know the word contains B, O, and U, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in BOUND:
- B was in position 1 → it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- O was in position 2 → it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- U was in position 3 → it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses B, O, and U, avoids R, A, I, S, E, N, D, and places these letters in different positions.

Available consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: O, U (already must be used)

I'll try a word that rearranges B, O, U and adds two more unused consonants. A good candidate is ""COBUX"" but that's not a valid English word. Let's think of real words:

Possible words:
- BULKY (but L and K are allowed, Y is allowed)
- BUMPY
- BURLY (but R is invalid)
- BUSHY (but S and H are invalid)
- BUGLY (not a word)
- BULGY (not common)
- BOUGH (but G and H are allowed)
- BOUGH is a valid word (B-O-U-G-H), but we know U is not in position 3, so this would place U correctly in position 3 → invalid
- BOGUS (but S is invalid)
- BOOMY (but M and Y are allowed, O is repeated - possible)
- BUMPY (B-U-M-P-Y): checks positions:
  - B is in position 1 (but we know B cannot be in position 1) → invalid
- COMBY (not a word)
- GLOUB (not a word)
- TOUGH (but T, G, H are allowed)
- TOUGH: T-O-U-G-H
  - T in position 1 (allowed)
  - O in position 2 (but we know O cannot be in position 2 from BOUND) → invalid
- YOUTH (but Y, T, H allowed)
  - Y-O-U-T-H
  - O in position 2 again → invalid
- GLOUT (not a word)
- CLOUT (but C, L, T allowed)
  - C-L-O-U-T
  - O is in position 3 (allowed, since BOUND had O in position 2)
  - U is in position 4 (allowed, since BOUND had U in position 3)

CLOUT seems valid:
- Contains O and U
- Contains C, L, T (all new letters)
- O is in position 3 (allowed)
- U is in position 4 (allowed)
- No R, A, I, S, E, N, D

Another candidate: COBLY (but not a word)
CUBIT: but I and T allowed, but I is invalid
CUBBY: but B is repeated
COMBO: but M, B allowed, O repeated, but B is in position 4 (allowed), O in positions 1 and 3 (allowed)
However, COMBO uses B and O correctly positioned, but doesn't use U.

CLOUT seems best as it uses O and U in new positions and introduces three new letters.

So far we have:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
R, A, I, S, E, N, D, C, L, T  

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions

From CLOUT we learned:
- C (x) → not in word  
- L (x) → not in word  
- O (-) → in word, but not in position 3  
- U (-) → in word, but not in position 4  
- T (x) → not in word  

So the secret word must contain B, O, and U, and none of the letters already excluded.  
The still-available consonants are:  
F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We now know:
- B cannot be in positions 1 (from BOUND)  
- O cannot be in positions 2 (from BOUND) or 3 (from CLOUT)  
- U cannot be in positions 3 (from BOUND) or 4 (from CLOUT)  

We need a 5-letter word that uses B, O, U plus two other still-valid consonants, while respecting the positional restrictions above.

A good choice is “GUMBO” because:
- Contains B, O, U  
- Introduces two new consonants G and M  
- Respects positional constraints:
  – B is in position 4 (allowed)  
  – O is in position 3 (but we know O cannot be in 3) → Oops, that’s a violation!

Next candidate: “HUMBO” – invalid (not a word)

Next: “POGUM” – invalid (not a word)

Next: “JUMBO” – valid word and positions:
- J in 1 (allowed)  
- U in 2 (allowed)  
- M in 3 (allowed)  
- B in 4 (allowed)  
- O in 5 (allowed)  

This satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words\n\nA strong starting word should include common vowels and consonants. Some excellent options are:\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)\n- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)\n- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll choose ""RAISE"" as it includes:\n- R (very common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- I (second most common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All the letters in ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E) were marked with (x), meaning none of them appear in the secret word at all.

We now have:

Letters NOT in the word (x-marked):  
R, A, I, S, E, N, D, C, L, T, J  

Letters KNOWN to be in the word and already in the correct final positions (✓-marked):  
position 2: U  
position 3: M  
position 4: B  
position 5: O  

That leaves only position 1 to be determined.

Available letters (not yet eliminated and not yet placed) among common consonants:  
F, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a single consonant for position 1 that forms a valid 5-letter English word with the locked-in pattern _UMBO.

The only valid English word that fits is “GUMBO”.
But “GUMBO” would put G in position 1 and we already know that G has not been eliminated.

Therefore the first letter must be G.
