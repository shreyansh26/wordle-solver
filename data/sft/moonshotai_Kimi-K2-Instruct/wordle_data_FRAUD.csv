For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are vowels (especially E, A, O) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Popular starting choices include words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" etc. These words include a mix of common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), providing a good spread of letters to test.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word.

So:
1. R is fixed in position 2.
2. A exists somewhere else (not position 1).
3. We need to avoid O, S, E entirely in any position.
4. The remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) can be any other letters except O,S,E.

Next, we should choose a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Uses A in a different position (positions 3,4,5).
- Introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, I, etc.) to test more possibilities.

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- R is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- A is in position 3 (different from position 1, so possible).

- Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.
- Remaining vowels: U (A is already used).

The word structure so far: _ R A _ _ (positions 2 and 3 locked).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet eliminated (avoiding O,S,E,T,I,N). Let's consider common combinations:

Possible letters for remaining positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common patterns:
- ""GRA__"" could be GRAPE, GRASP, but S and P are out. GRAVE? V is still available.
- ""CRAZY"" but Z and Y are less common.
- ""FRANK"" but N and K are out.
- ""BRAVO"" but V is allowed, O is out.
- ""BRAV_"" - BRAVA? But A is already used in position 3.
- ""GRA__"" - GRAFT? T is out.
- ""GRAV_"" - GRAVE? E is out.
- ""CRAMP"" - M and P are allowed, but M is in TRAIN feedback (no, M wasn't tested yet).

Wait, from TRAIN feedback, N is out, but M wasn't tested - it's allowed.

Let's think of ""GRAVY"":
- G, R, A, V, Y - none of G,R,A,V,Y were eliminated yet except R and A positions are known.
- Structure: _ R A _ _
- GRAVE would be G R A V E, but E is out.
- So G R A V Y fits _ R A V _ (position 5 Y).

But does Y fit? Y wasn't eliminated yet. Let's check:
- G: new
- R: position 2 (✓)
- A: position 3 (✓)
- V: new
- Y: new

GRAVY seems valid. Other options:
- CRANK: N and K are out.
- BRAVO: O is out.
- DRANK: N and K are out.
- CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P - none eliminated except positions known.

Between GRAVY and CRAMP, CRAMP uses C, M, P which are all new and common, and fits the pattern _ R A M P (but position 4 is M, position 5 is P).

But wait, we know position 3 is A, so structure is _ R A _ _.

For CRAMP:
- C (1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) - all letters are allowed (not eliminated).
This seems better as it tests more new common letters.

Similarly, GRAVY would be G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5).

Between these, CRAMP tests C, M, P which are very common and haven't appeared yet, while GRAVY tests less common letters (G, V, Y). So CRAMP is more informative.

However, let's double-check:
- Letters used in CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P
- Eliminated letters: O,S,E,T,I,N
- C, M, P are all new and common.

CRAMP fits the known pattern perfectly.

Wait, from TRAIN feedback, N is out, but M wasn't tested - it's allowed.

Let's think of ""GRAVY"":
- G, R, A, V, Y - none of G,R,A,V,Y were eliminated yet except R and A positions are known.
- Structure: _ R A _ _
- GRAVE would be G R A V E, but E is out.
- So G R A V Y fits _ R A V _ (position 5 Y).

But does Y fit? Y wasn't eliminated yet. Let's check:
- G: new
- R: position 2 (✓)
- A: position 3 (✓)
- V: new
- Y: new

GRAVY seems valid. Other options:
- CRANK: N and K are out.
- BRAVO: O is out.
- DRANK: N and K are out.
- CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P - none eliminated except positions known.

Between GRAVY and CRAMP, CRAMP uses C, M, P which are all new and common, and fits the pattern _ R A M P (but position 4 is M, position 5 is P).

But wait, we know position 3 is A, so structure is _ R A _ _.

For CRAMP:
- C (1), R(2), A(3), M(4), P(5) - all letters are allowed (not eliminated).
This seems better as it tests more new common letters.

Similarly, GRAVY would be G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5).

Between these, CRAMP tests C, M, P which are very common and haven't appeared yet, while GRAVY tests less common letters (G, V, Y). So CRAMP is more informative.

However, let's double-check:
- Letters used in CRAMP: C, R, A, M, P
- Eliminated letters: O,S,E,T,I,N
- C, M, P are all new and common.

CRAMP fits the known pattern perfectly.

- Vowel A is already used in position 3, so the other vowel still allowed is U.

Structure so far: _ R A _ _ (positions 1, 4, 5 to fill)

Good strategy:
- Use U early to test vowel possibilities.
- Pick common consonants still allowed (B, D, F, G, H, K, L…).

Likely English patterns with R A in the middle:
- B R A _ _
- D R A _ _
- G R A _ _
- H R A _ _
- K R A _ _
- L R A _ _
- F R A _ _

Among these, “BRAVO” and “GRAVE” etc. reuse eliminated letters.  
“DRAWS” uses S (eliminated).  
“GRAVY” would use V and Y, but Y is possible.

However, the simplest common word fitting the remaining letters appears to be:
B R A _ _

We need two more consonants from the still-allowed set.  
Good choices: B, D, F, G, H, K, L…

Looking at remaining letters, let’s try:
B R A K E – but E is eliminated.  
B R A V O – O eliminated.  
B R A I N – I eliminated.  
B R A V E – E eliminated.  
B R A D S – S eliminated.

Next best is **BRAVY** or **GRAVY**, but Y is allowed and we have V and Y still unused.  
However, to test more common consonants, let’s pick **BRAVY**.

But let’s think of a more common word with the remaining letters: **FRAIL** – I eliminated.  
**FRANK** – N eliminated.  
**DRANK** – N eliminated.  
**GRAND** – N eliminated.

Another option: **GRAVE** – E eliminated.  
**GRAVY** – G, R, A, V, Y are all allowed.

So **GRAVY** is valid.

Alternatively, let’s try **BRAKY** – but K and Y are allowed.  
**BRAKY** isn’t very common.

Looking again, **BRASH** – S and H are allowed, but S is eliminated.

Best simple word that uses new common letters: **BRAVY**.

Wait, let’s re-list allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try **DRAUL** – not a word.  
**FRUMP** – P eliminated.  
**FLANK** – N and K are allowed, but N is eliminated.

Next best is **GRAVY** (G, R, A, V, Y) – all letters are still allowed.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are vowels (especially E, A, O) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. \n\nPopular starting choices include words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" etc. These words include a mix of common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. \n\nAfter considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), providing a good spread of letters to test.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- O, S, E are not in the word.\n\nSo:\n1.

What we now know for certain:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = A
- Letters **eliminated** so far (marked x in any position):
  O, S, E, T, I, N, C, M, P, G, V, Y
- Letters **still possible** (not yet used or eliminated):
  B, D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Z
- No repeats of A or R are allowed (since only one A and one R appear in the feedback so far).

So the pattern is: _ R A _ _

We need three new distinct letters from the remaining pool: first, fourth, fifth positions.

Among the remaining letters, vowels available:
- Only U (only vowel left besides A, which is already used).

So U must be placed once.

Consonants available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, W, X, Z.
