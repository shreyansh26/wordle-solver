Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the chance of getting hits. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. This should give me a good amount of information to work with for subsequent guesses.

The feedback from AROSE tells us that none of those five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So we now know:

- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word that avoids those five letters entirely, yet still uses some of the other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U).  
A frequently recommended second guess in this situation is “UNITY” because it uses three fresh vowels (U, I, Y counts as vowel‐like) and two new common consonants (N, T) that have not been eliminated.

Other good options would include “UNTIL”, “INPUT”, or “MOUNT”, but “UNITY” keeps the maximum spread of untouched letters.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (✗): A, R, O, S, E, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but position unknown (–): N, I, Y  

So the secret word must contain the letters N, I, Y (each once) and two other letters that are not any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowel: none left other than the already-used I and Y; Y acts as a vowel here.

I’ll choose a word that places N, I, Y along with two fresh consonants to maximize positional information.  
A convenient candidate is “NYMPH”:  
- Uses N, Y, plus two new consonants M and P that haven’t been tested.  
- Contains H, also fresh.

This will let me see exactly where N, I, Y belong and test M, P, H for inclusion.

A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the chance of getting hits. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. This should give me a good amount of information to work with for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us that none of those five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So we now know:

- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word that avoids those five letters entirely, yet still uses some of the other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U).  
A frequently recommended second guess in this situation is “UNITY” because it uses three fresh vowels (U, I, Y counts as vowel‐like) and two new common consonants (N, T) that have not been eliminated.

Other good options would include “UNTIL”, “INPUT”, or “MOUNT”, but “UNITY” keeps the maximum spread of untouched letters.

So I’ll go with:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (✗): A, R, O, S, E, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but position unknown (–): N, I, Y  

So the secret word must contain the letters N, I, Y (each once) and two other letters that are not any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowel: none left other than the already-used I and Y; Y acts as a vowel here.

I’ll choose a word that places N, I, Y along with two fresh consonants to maximize positional information.  
A convenient candidate is “NYMPH”:  
- Uses N, Y, plus two new consonants M and P that haven’t been tested.  
- Contains H, also fresh.

This will let me see exactly where N, I, Y belong and test M, P, H for inclusion.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints so far:

Letters we KNOW are in the word (but position unknown):
- N, I, Y   (each appears once)

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, P, H   (10 letters already eliminated)

That leaves the following still-possible letters:
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the already-known N, I, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that contains N, I, Y exactly once each (since duplicates would have shown up differently) and two fresh letters from the “still allowed” list.

Let’s pick two additional consonants that are frequent in English and haven’t been tried: let’s use D and G.

Candidate words containing N, I, Y plus two new letters:
- DINGY  → uses D, N, I, G, Y  → all letters allowed
- WINDY  → but W and D are still allowed, but we only need two new letters.

“DINGY” looks perfect: it uses I in the middle spot, N at 2, Y at 5, plus new letters D and G. It satisfies every restriction.

So we submit DINGY.

From the four guesses we now have:

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- I in position 2
- N in position 3

Letters known to be in the word but positions unknown:
- Y (since it showed up as “in word but wrong position” in guesses 2 and 4)

Letters known NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, P, H, D, G   (12 letters eliminated)

Remaining letters that could still be used:
B, C, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that looks like:
_ I N _ _

and must contain one Y somewhere, and two other letters from the remaining set (no duplicates so far indicated).

Possible placements for Y:
- position 1 (Y I N _ _)
- position 4 (_ I N Y _)
- position 5 (_ I N _ Y)  but Y already ruled out at 5 by guess 4 feedback (guess 4 had Y in 5th and it was marked wrong position, so Y cannot be in 5).

So Y can be in 1 or 4.

Let’s build candidate words:

1. Y I N _ _  
   We need two more letters from {B,C,F,J,K,L,Q,V,W,X,Z}.  
   Common consonants left: C, F, K, L, V  
   Try Y I N K _ – we need a 5th letter; nothing obvious makes a word.  
   Try Y I N C _ – same issue, no common word.  
   Y I N L _ – nothing.  
   Seems scarce.

2. _ I N Y _  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 5.  
   Possible: F, L, V, W…  
   Try F I N Y L – makes “FINYL” (but not a recognized word).  
   Try V I N Y L – “VINYL” is a valid English word.  
   Check constraints:  
   - Uses V, I, N, Y, L.  
   - V and L haven’t been used yet, both are in the allowed set.  
   - Places Y in position 4 (allowed).  
   - I in 2, N in 3 (matches).  
   - No forbidden letters.

Therefore “VINYL” satisfies every constraint so far.
