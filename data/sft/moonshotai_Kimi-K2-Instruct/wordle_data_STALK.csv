For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good first word should cover multiple vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A popular and effective first word is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage to see which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S
- Does NOT contain R, I, or E
- The A is NOT in position 2
- The S is NOT in position 4

Now I need to find a 5-letter word that uses A and S, without R, I, or E. Good candidates would be words like SCALD, SLOAN, or SALTY. 

Looking at these:
- SCALD: C,L,D are common consonants, A is allowed
- SALTY: L,T,Y are common consonants, A is allowed

Between these, SALTY seems better as it uses Y which is a common ending letter.

But wait - does SALTY contain any forbidden letters? S,A,L,T,Y - none of R,I,E appear, so it's valid.

The positions would be:
- S in position 1 (allowed since S was rejected in position 4, not 1)
- A in position 2 (but feedback said A is wrong in position 2) - so this is invalid!

So SALTY is no good because A is in position 2. Let me think differently - A could be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Try SCALD:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- C in position 2
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- L in position 4
- D in position 5

This seems valid - contains S and A, and no forbidden letters.

From the feedback on SMALL:
- S A L L are all in the word and correctly placed except the last L (marked “-”), which means:
  – S is correct in position 1
  – A is correct in position 3
  – L is correct in position 4
  – the final letter is NOT L (because L(-) tells us there is an L but not in position 5).

So our pattern is:
1 2 3 4 5
S _ A L ?

We need a letter for position 2 and a letter for position 5 that:
- are NOT among the already-ruled-out letters: R, I, E, C, D, M, L
- and the position-5 letter must not be L (already enforced).

Letters still allowed (common ones):
F G H J K N P Q T U V W X Y Z

Position 2 must be one of these. Position 5 must be one of these.

Notice the word already has A in position 3, so we don’t need another vowel, though one is allowed.

Scanning the dictionary for matches:
S F A L ?
S G A L ?
S H A L ?  → SHALL uses H and L, but L is already in the word and we have it confirmed. The second L is not allowed in position 5 (SMALL feedback), but SHALL ends in L… no good.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,STALK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good first word should cover multiple vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A popular and effective first word is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage to see which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S
- Does NOT contain R, I, or E
- The A is NOT in position 2
- The S is NOT in position 4

Now I need to find a 5-letter word that uses A and S, without R, I, or E. Good candidates would be words like SCALD, SLOAN, or SALTY. 

Looking at these:
- SCALD: C,L,D are common consonants, A is allowed
- SALTY: L,T,Y are common consonants, A is allowed

Between these, SALTY seems better as it uses Y which is a common ending letter.

But wait - does SALTY contain any forbidden letters? S,A,L,T,Y - none of R,I,E appear, so it's valid.

The positions would be:
- S in position 1 (allowed since S was rejected in position 4, not 1)
- A in position 2 (but feedback said A is wrong in position 2) - so this is invalid!

So SALTY is no good because A is in position 2. Let me think differently - A could be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Try SCALD:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- C in position 2
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- L in position 4
- D in position 5

This seems valid - contains S and A, and no forbidden letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SCALD:

- A is correct in position 3 (✓ at spot 3)

- C is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is:
1 2 3 4 5
S _ A L _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, I, E, C, D  
Letters we know ARE in the word: S (pos 1), A (pos 3), L (pos 4)

We still need letters for positions 2 and 5.  
Available letters (excluding the ones ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels not yet ruled out (only A is confirmed).

Good candidates with this pattern: SMALL, SMALT, SNAIL (invalid, has I), SPALL, STALL, SWALl (invalid), etc.

Looking at these, SMALL fits perfectly:
- S (pos 1) ✓
- M (pos 2) - allowed
- A (pos 3) ✓
- L (pos 4) ✓
- L (pos 5) - allowed

And it doesn't use any forbidden letters: R, I, E, C, D are not present.

Position 2 must be one of these. Position 5 must be one of these.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good first word should cover multiple vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\nA popular and effective first word is ""RAISE"" because it contains:\n- R (very common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- I (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage to see which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- I is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and S\n- Does NOT contain R, I, or E\n- The A is NOT in position 2\n- The S is NOT in position 4\n\nNow I need to find a 5-letter word that uses A and S, without R, I, or E.

S,A,L,T,Y - none of R,I,E appear, so it's valid.\n\nThe positions would be:\n- S in position 1 (allowed since S was rejected in position 4, not 1)\n- A in position 2 (but feedback said A is wrong in position 2) - so this is invalid!\n\nSo SALTY is no good because A is in position 2.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: S _ A L _
- So far we have:
  1 2 3 4 5
  S ? A L ?
- Letters already ruled OUT: R, I, E, C, D, M, P, L (in position 5)
- Letters allowed in positions 2 and 5: any letters not in the above list.

From SMALL we learned the word contains L but not in position 5.  
From SPALT we learned the word contains T but not in position 5.

Therefore the word must contain both T and L, and the only place the T can go is position 2, because position 5 is the only other open slot and we just learned it’s not T.

So the word must be:
S T A L ?

But position 5 cannot be T or L (already known), and we need a fifth letter that hasn’t been eliminated.  
Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common 5-letter English words fitting S T A L _:

STALL – ends in L, but L is already in position 4 and we know the word has only one L (from SMALL feedback). So STALL would have two L’s, contradicting SMALL.

STALE – ends in E, but E is ruled out.

STALK – ends in K, all letters allowed: S T A L K.

STANG – ends in G.

STANK – ends in K.

STAPH – ends in H.

STARE – ends in E (ruled out).

STASH – ends in H.

STAVE – ends in E (ruled out).

STAWN – obscure.

STAYS – ends in S, but S is already in position 1 and we have no evidence of a second S.

Among these, STALK is a perfectly valid word and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore: STALK.
