For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about vowels and common consonants in the word.

Other strong alternatives include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- SAUCE (S, A, U, C, E)

I think ""CRANE"" is the best choice here as it provides the most balanced coverage of common letters without repeating any.

From the feedback on CRANE we know:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains A, and does not contain C, R, N, or E.  
Next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels (since E is ruled out) while keeping A in a new position.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, M, D, etc.  
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A is already known to exist).

A strong second-guess word that avoids C, R, N, E and places A in a different spot while adding new common letters is “STOAM” (but O and A together may be less common).  
Better is “STOAD” (but D is less common than T or S).  
Better yet: “STOMA” – S, T, O, M, A – places A at the end and uses very common letters.

But let’s verify:  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Moves A to position 5.  
- Introduces S, T, O, M – all common.

Another excellent option is “AUDIO” (but O is in position 5 same as A in CRANE).  
Actually “AUDIO” keeps A in position 1 – we already know A is not in position 3, so position 1 is fine.  
But we also want to keep S for common consonant.

So best is “STOMA”.

But wait – let’s think again. The word must be a valid English 5-letter word. STOMA is valid (botany term).  
A simpler, more common word: “STOAT” – but T repeats.  
Another: “STOAL” – not common.  
“STOAM” – not a word.  
“STOAD” – archaic.  
“STOMA” is fine.

However, let’s pick a more common word: “STAID” – S, T, A, I, D.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A in position 3 again (but we know A is not in position 3).  
So STAID is bad.

“STOIC” – contains C (ruled out).  
“STOAE” – contains E (ruled out).  
Thus “STOMA” is actually the best.

But let’s try a simpler common word: “STOAK” – not a word.  
“STOAS” – plural of stoa, uncommon.  
Thus, the most common 5-letter word avoiding C, R, N, E and moving A is “STOMA”.  
However, “STOMA” is less common.  

Let’s pick “STOAT” instead – T is repeated but it’s a common word.  
But repeating T is not ideal.  

Actually, another great option is “SLAID” – S, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 again (ruled out).  

“STAIN” – contains N (ruled out).  

“STAIG” – uncommon.  

Thus, the best common word is “STOMA”.  
However, to be safe, let’s pick “STOAT” even with T repeat, as it’s a common word.  

But the feedback from CRANE already gives us:
- Letters to avoid: C, R, N, E  
- A is in the word but not in position 3  

A better choice is “STOAM” – but not a word.  
“STOMA” is valid.  

Final decision: “STOMA” is the most balanced second guess.  

But wait – let’s reconsider. A common word avoiding C, R, N, E, placing A in position 1:  
“ADIOS” – contains S at end.  
“ADIOS” is 5 letters: A D I O S.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A at position 1.  
- Introduces D, I, O, S.  

This seems excellent.  

Thus, the next best guess is “ADIOS”.

From the two guesses we have:

2. A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.
3. Letters we can still use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t tried yet).
   BUT we also know the word is only 5 letters long, so we need common consonants and vowels that haven’t been eliminated.
4. Vowels left: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, I, O are out).

Next guess should:
- Place A in a position that hasn’t been ruled out (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Use common consonants we haven’t tried yet (e.g., L, B, T, M, P, etc.).
- Include U as the only other possible vowel.

A strong candidate is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but let’s check:
- A is missing, so PLUMB is invalid.

We need A in the word.  
A good approach is to try a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, and use common consonants.

- A is in position 3 (already ruled out) – bad.

Consider “PLAGU” (not a word).

Valid word: “BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y.

“BALMY” seems perfect.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about vowels and common consonants in the word.

Other strong alternatives include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- SAUCE (S, A, U, C, E)

I think ""CRANE"" is the best choice here as it provides the most balanced coverage of common letters without repeating any.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE we know:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains A, and does not contain C, R, N, or E.  
Next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels (since E is ruled out) while keeping A in a new position.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, M, D, etc.  
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A is already known to exist).

A strong second-guess word that avoids C, R, N, E and places A in a different spot while adding new common letters is “STOAM” (but O and A together may be less common).  
Better is “STOAD” (but D is less common than T or S).  
Better yet: “STOMA” – S, T, O, M, A – places A at the end and uses very common letters.

But let’s verify:  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Moves A to position 5.  
- Introduces S, T, O, M – all common.

Another excellent option is “AUDIO” (but O is in position 5 same as A in CRANE).  
Actually “AUDIO” keeps A in position 1 – we already know A is not in position 3, so position 1 is fine.  
But we also want to keep S for common consonant.

So best is “STOMA”.

But wait – let’s think again. The word must be a valid English 5-letter word. STOMA is valid (botany term).  
A simpler, more common word: “STOAT” – but T repeats.  
Another: “STOAL” – not common.  
“STOAM” – not a word.  
“STOAD” – archaic.  
“STOMA” is fine.

However, let’s pick a more common word: “STAID” – S, T, A, I, D.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A in position 3 again (but we know A is not in position 3).  
So STAID is bad.

“STOIC” – contains C (ruled out).  
“STOAE” – contains E (ruled out).  
Thus “STOMA” is actually the best.

But let’s try a simpler common word: “STOAK” – not a word.  
“STOAS” – plural of stoa, uncommon.  
Thus, the most common 5-letter word avoiding C, R, N, E and moving A is “STOMA”.  
However, “STOMA” is less common.  

Let’s pick “STOAT” instead – T is repeated but it’s a common word.  
But repeating T is not ideal.  

Actually, another great option is “SLAID” – S, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 again (ruled out).  

“STAIN” – contains N (ruled out).  

“STAIG” – uncommon.  

Thus, the best common word is “STOMA”.  
However, to be safe, let’s pick “STOAT” even with T repeat, as it’s a common word.  

But the feedback from CRANE already gives us:
- Letters to avoid: C, R, N, E  
- A is in the word but not in position 3  

A better choice is “STOAM” – but not a word.  
“STOMA” is valid.  

Final decision: “STOMA” is the most balanced second guess.  

But wait – let’s reconsider. A common word avoiding C, R, N, E, placing A in position 1:  
“ADIOS” – contains S at end.  
“ADIOS” is 5 letters: A D I O S.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A at position 1.  
- Introduces D, I, O, S.  

This seems excellent.  

Thus, the next best guess is “ADIOS”.

<guess>ADIOS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

- ADIOS → A(-) D(x) I(x) O(x) S(x)  
  ⇒ A is again present but not in position 1.  
  ⇒ D, I, O, S are absent.

So far, we know:
1. The word contains A.
2. A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.
3. Letters we can still use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t tried yet).
   BUT we also know the word is only 5 letters long, so we need common consonants and vowels that haven’t been eliminated.
4. Vowels left: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, I, O are out).

Next guess should:
- Place A in a position that hasn’t been ruled out (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Use common consonants we haven’t tried yet (e.g., L, B, T, M, P, etc.).
- Include U as the only other possible vowel.

A strong candidate is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but let’s check:
- A is missing, so PLUMB is invalid.

We need A in the word.  
A good approach is to try a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, and use common consonants.

Consider “PLATY” (P, L, A, T, Y):
- A is in position 3 (already ruled out) – bad.

Consider “PLAGU” (not a word).  
Consider “PLAGA” (not a word).  

Another approach: use common consonants T, L, M, P, B with A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Valid word: “TALKS” – but S is out.  
Valid word: “TALUK” – uncommon.  
Valid word: “BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y.  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- B, L, M, Y are new.  
- No eliminated letters.

“BALMY” seems perfect.

Let’s double-check:
- Contains A (confirmed).  
- A is in position 2 (not ruled out).  
- Letters B, L, M, Y haven’t been tried.  
- No C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S.

   - A is confirmed in position 2 (✓).

   - B, M, Y are absent.

Summary of constraints:
- Word is 5 letters.
- A is at position 2: _ A _ _ _
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so L can be in positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters absent so far: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, B, M, Y.

Remaining possible consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.
Remaining possible vowels: U (since A is used and E, I, O are out).

We need to place L in positions 1, 4, or 5, and fill the other spots with remaining letters. Also, since U is the only other vowel, it’s likely in the word.

Possible word structure:
- Position 1: L or another consonant.
- Position 2: A.
- Position 3: U.
- Position 4: L or another consonant.
- Position 5: L or another consonant.

Let’s try L at position 1: L A _ _ _
But L must not be in position 3, so positions 3, 4, 5 can be filled with remaining letters.  
However, L is already at position 1, so it can’t repeat.  

Possible words:
- L A U T H (LAUTH – not a word)
- L A U G H (LAUGH – check letters: L, A, U, G, H. All allowed and unused.)
  - L is at position 1 (allowed since it’s not position 3).  
  - U is at position 3.  
  - G and H are new.

Thus, ""LAUGH"" fits perfectly.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. ADIOS → A(-) D(x) I(x) O(x) S(x)  
   - A is again in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - D, I, O, S are absent.

3. BALMY → B(x) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - B, M, Y are absent.

Summary of constraints:
- Word is 5 letters.
- A is at position 2: _ A _ _ _
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so L can be in positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters absent so far: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, B, M, Y.

Remaining possible consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.
Remaining possible vowels: U (since A is used and E, I, O are out).

We need to place L in positions 1, 4, or 5, and fill the other spots with remaining letters. Also, since U is the only other vowel, it’s likely in the word.

Possible word structure:
- Position 1: L or another consonant.
- Position 2: A.
- Position 3: U.
- Position 4: L or another consonant.
- Position 5: L or another consonant.

Let’s try L at position 1: L A _ _ _
But L must not be in position 3, so positions 3, 4, 5 can be filled with remaining letters.  
However, L is already at position 1, so it can’t repeat.  

Possible words:
- L A U T H (LAUTH – not a word)
- L A U G H (LAUGH – check letters: L, A, U, G, H. All allowed and unused.)
  - L is at position 1 (allowed since it’s not position 3).  
  - U is at position 3.  
  - G and H are new.

Thus, ""LAUGH"" fits perfectly.",Guess 4: LAUGH -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about vowels and common consonants in the word.

Other strong alternatives include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- SAUCE (S, A, U, C, E)

I think ""CRANE"" is the best choice here as it provides the most balanced coverage of common letters without repeating any.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE we know:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains A, and does not contain C, R, N, or E.  
Next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels (since E is ruled out) while keeping A in a new position.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, M, D, etc.  
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A is already known to exist).

A strong second-guess word that avoids C, R, N, E and places A in a different spot while adding new common letters is “STOAM” (but O and A together may be less common).  
Better is “STOAD” (but D is less common than T or S).  
Better yet: “STOMA” – S, T, O, M, A – places A at the end and uses very common letters.

But let’s verify:  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Moves A to position 5.  
- Introduces S, T, O, M – all common.

Another excellent option is “AUDIO” (but O is in position 5 same as A in CRANE).  
Actually “AUDIO” keeps A in position 1 – we already know A is not in position 3, so position 1 is fine.  
But we also want to keep S for common consonant.

So best is “STOMA”.

But wait – let’s think again. The word must be a valid English 5-letter word. STOMA is valid (botany term).  
A simpler, more common word: “STOAT” – but T repeats.  
Another: “STOAL” – not common.  
“STOAM” – not a word.  
“STOAD” – archaic.  
“STOMA” is fine.

However, let’s pick a more common word: “STAID” – S, T, A, I, D.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A in position 3 again (but we know A is not in position 3).  
So STAID is bad.

“STOIC” – contains C (ruled out).  
“STOAE” – contains E (ruled out).  
Thus “STOMA” is actually the best.

But let’s try a simpler common word: “STOAK” – not a word.  
“STOAS” – plural of stoa, uncommon.  
Thus, the most common 5-letter word avoiding C, R, N, E and moving A is “STOMA”.  
However, “STOMA” is less common.  

Let’s pick “STOAT” instead – T is repeated but it’s a common word.  
But repeating T is not ideal.  

Actually, another great option is “SLAID” – S, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 again (ruled out).  

“STAIN” – contains N (ruled out).  

“STAIG” – uncommon.  

Thus, the best common word is “STOMA”.  
However, to be safe, let’s pick “STOAT” even with T repeat, as it’s a common word.  

But the feedback from CRANE already gives us:
- Letters to avoid: C, R, N, E  
- A is in the word but not in position 3  

A better choice is “STOAM” – but not a word.  
“STOMA” is valid.  

Final decision: “STOMA” is the most balanced second guess.  

But wait – let’s reconsider. A common word avoiding C, R, N, E, placing A in position 1:  
“ADIOS” – contains S at end.  
“ADIOS” is 5 letters: A D I O S.  
- Avoids C, R, N, E.  
- Places A at position 1.  
- Introduces D, I, O, S.  

This seems excellent.  

Thus, the next best guess is “ADIOS”.

<guess>ADIOS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) I(x) O(x) S(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

- CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  ⇒ A is present but not in position 3.  
  ⇒ C, R, N, E are absent.

- ADIOS → A(-) D(x) I(x) O(x) S(x)  
  ⇒ A is again present but not in position 1.  
  ⇒ D, I, O, S are absent.

So far, we know:
1. The word contains A.
2. A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.
3. Letters we can still use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any we haven’t tried yet).
   BUT we also know the word is only 5 letters long, so we need common consonants and vowels that haven’t been eliminated.
4. Vowels left: U (since A is already confirmed, and E, I, O are out).

Next guess should:
- Place A in a position that hasn’t been ruled out (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Use common consonants we haven’t tried yet (e.g., L, B, T, M, P, etc.).
- Include U as the only other possible vowel.

A strong candidate is “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but let’s check:
- A is missing, so PLUMB is invalid.

We need A in the word.  
A good approach is to try a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, and use common consonants.

Consider “PLATY” (P, L, A, T, Y):
- A is in position 3 (already ruled out) – bad.

Consider “PLAGU” (not a word).  
Consider “PLAGA” (not a word).  

Another approach: use common consonants T, L, M, P, B with A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Valid word: “TALKS” – but S is out.  
Valid word: “TALUK” – uncommon.  
Valid word: “BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y.  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- B, L, M, Y are new.  
- No eliminated letters.

“BALMY” seems perfect.

Let’s double-check:
- Contains A (confirmed).  
- A is in position 2 (not ruled out).  
- Letters B, L, M, Y haven’t been tried.  
- No C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S.

Thus, the best next guess is “BALMY”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

   - D, I, O, S are absent.

3. BALMY → B(x) A(✓) L(-) M(x) Y(x)  
   - A is confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - B, M, Y are absent.

Summary of constraints:
- Word is 5 letters.
- A is at position 2: _ A _ _ _
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so L can be in positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters absent so far: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, B, M, Y.

Remaining possible consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.
Remaining possible vowels: U (since A is used and E, I, O are out).

We need to place L in positions 1, 4, or 5, and fill the other spots with remaining letters. Also, since U is the only other vowel, it’s likely in the word.

Possible word structure:
- Position 1: L or another consonant.
- Position 2: A.
- Position 3: U.
- Position 4: L or another consonant.
- Position 5: L or another consonant.

Let’s try L at position 1: L A _ _ _
But L must not be in position 3, so positions 3, 4, 5 can be filled with remaining letters.  
However, L is already at position 1, so it can’t repeat.  

Possible words:
- L A U T H (LAUTH – not a word)
- L A U G H (LAUGH – check letters: L, A, U, G, H. All allowed and unused.)
  - L is at position 1 (allowed since it’s not position 3).  
  - U is at position 3.  
  - G and H are new.

Thus, ""LAUGH"" fits perfectly.

  – A is locked in position 2 (✓).  
  – L is in the word but not in position 1 (-).  
  – U, G, H are not in the word (x).

So far we know:

1. Word pattern: _ A _ _ _ (A fixed at position 2).  
2. Letters that are OUT: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, B, M, Y, U, G, H.  
3. Letter L is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (already excluded from positions 1 and 3 by feedback).  
   Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.  
4. Remaining legal consonants: F, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.  
5. Remaining vowels: none (A already used, E, I, O, U eliminated).  
   So positions 1, 3, 5 must all be consonants.

Possible patterns:
- Pos 1: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 2: A  
- Pos 3: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 4: L (since L must be in 4 or 5)  
- Pos 5: any allowed consonant  

OR

- Pos 1: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 2: A  
- Pos 3: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 4: any allowed consonant

Examples that are 5-letter words:
- T A J L _ → no valid word  
- T A K L _ → no valid word  
- P A K L _ → no valid word  

Pattern 2: _ A _ _ L  
Examples:
- F A T A L (letters F, A, T, A, L) – A repeats (allowed since A already known) but let’s check letters: F, T, A, L – all allowed (F, T not eliminated).  
- F A K A L – not a word  
- P A T T L – not a word, and T repeats unnecessarily  
- F A T A L is the only common word that fits.

Check letters: F, A, T, A, L  
- F, T have never been tried and are not in the eliminated set.  
- A is confirmed.  
- L is confirmed (and now placed at position 5, satisfying the “not in 1 or 3” rule).

Thus, “FATAL” is the logical next guess.

<guess>FATAL</guess>",FATAL,"From the latest feedback:

- L(-) A(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)  
  – A is locked in position 2 (✓).  
  – L is in the word but not in position 1 (-).  
  – U, G, H are not in the word (x).

So far we know:

1. Word pattern: _ A _ _ _ (A fixed at position 2).  
2. Letters that are OUT: C, R, N, E, D, I, O, S, B, M, Y, U, G, H.  
3. Letter L is in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (already excluded from positions 1 and 3 by feedback).  
   Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.  
4. Remaining legal consonants: F, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.  
5. Remaining vowels: none (A already used, E, I, O, U eliminated).  
   So positions 1, 3, 5 must all be consonants.

Possible patterns:
- Pos 1: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 2: A  
- Pos 3: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 4: L (since L must be in 4 or 5)  
- Pos 5: any allowed consonant  

OR

- Pos 1: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 2: A  
- Pos 3: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 4: any allowed consonant  
- Pos 5: L  

Let’s build words that fit.

Pattern 1: _ A _ L _  
Examples that are 5-letter words:
- T A J L _ → no valid word  
- T A K L _ → no valid word  
- P A K L _ → no valid word  

Pattern 2: _ A _ _ L  
Examples:
- F A T A L (letters F, A, T, A, L) – A repeats (allowed since A already known) but let’s check letters: F, T, A, L – all allowed (F, T not eliminated).  
- F A K A L – not a word  
- P A T T L – not a word, and T repeats unnecessarily  
- F A T A L is the only common word that fits.

Check letters: F, A, T, A, L  
- F, T have never been tried and are not in the eliminated set.  
- A is confirmed.  
- L is confirmed (and now placed at position 5, satisfying the “not in 1 or 3” rule).

Thus, “FATAL” is the logical next guess.",Guess 5: FATAL -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) T(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
