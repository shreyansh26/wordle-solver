For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. Since I have no prior feedback, I should pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, ideally covering different vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are good starting choices because they use common letters and can help identify multiple letters in the word.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong opening word with S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and the most frequent vowel A, along with E.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- The letters S, L, A are not in the word at all (marked x).
- The letters T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word must contain both T and E, but neither S, L, nor A. The positions of T and E must be different from positions 4 and 5 respectively.

That means:
- T is not in the 4th position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I want to make a new guess that:
1. Includes T and E in different positions (avoiding 4th for T and 5th for E).
2. Avoids S, L, A completely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Possible good letters to test next: R, N, I, O, etc.

I’ll try ""TORCH"":
- T is in the 1st position (new position for T, since it wasn’t in 4th originally).
- O is a new vowel (not A or E).
- R is a common consonant.
- C and H are also common consonants.
- E is not in this word, but I need to include E in my next guesses since it must be in the secret word. However, I want to test more consonants first to narrow down possibilities.

Actually, since E must be in the word, let me pick a word that includes both T and E in new positions. Let me try ""ENTER"":
- E is in positions 1 and 4 (but E was in position 5 originally, so position 4 is new for E).
- N, T, R are new letters.
- T is in position 2 (new position).

But ENTER has two Es, which might not be optimal since the original word only needs one E. Let me try ""TREND"":
- T is in position 1 (new for T).
- R, N, D are new consonants.
- E is in position 4 (new for E, since it was in 5 originally).

This seems better - TREND uses T and E in new positions and avoids S, L, A.

- D is also confirmed in the correct fifth position (✓).
- E is still in the word but **not** in the 4th position (-).
- R and N are **not** in the word (x).

Word pattern: T _ _ _ D  
It must contain E (but E ≠ 4th position).  
Letters to exclude so far: S, L, A, R, N.

Vowels left to test: I, O, U (since A and E are already accounted for).  
Common consonants left: C, H, M, K, G, B, F, etc.

I want a word that starts with T, ends with D, has an E somewhere in positions 2 or 3, and uses only allowed letters.  

Good candidates:
- TWEED (but W and second E might be uncommon)
- TEPID (all letters allowed, E in 2nd, P and I to test)
- TUBED (U and B are fresh letters)
- TAMED (M and A, but A is banned)
- TILED (I and L, but L is banned)

“TEPID” looks best: fits T _ _ _ D, keeps E in position 2 (new spot), introduces P and I.
