For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

I don't have any prior information about the secret word, so I'll start with a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. However, it uses 3 vowels which might be too many. 

Another good option is ""STARE"" - it has S, T, A, R, E. Or ""SLATE"" - S, L, A, T, E. 

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first choice because:
- S is very common
- L is common
- A is the most common vowel
- T and E are also very common
This gives me coverage of several key letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

   – S still correct in position 1.  
   – N and K are not in the word.  
   – A is still in the word and is NOT in position 3 (same as last clue).  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:

- Pattern: S _ _ _ _  
- Must contain A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).  
- Must contain C somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, N, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
  – Starts with S.  
  – Uses both A and C exactly once each.  
  – Places A not in position 3, and C not in position 4.  
  – Uses only the remaining letters (no L, T, E, N, K).

Remaining common consonants: R, D, P, B, M, F, G, H, etc.

Try positions:

Option 1: S A C _ _ → SAC is a prefix but no common word SAC**.  
Option 2: S A _ C _ → SA _ C _  
Option 3: S _ A C _ → but C cannot be in 4, so invalid.  
Option 4: S _ _ A C → possible.  
Option 5: S _ _ C A → possible.  
Option 6: S C _ A _ → possible.  
Option 7: S _ C A _ → possible.

Let’s pick one that is common and tests safe letters.  
“SCARF”:
- Starts with S ✓.  
- Uses A in position 3 – but feedback says A is NOT in position 3 (from first guess where A was in 3 and marked “-”). So “SCARF” is invalid because of A in 3.

“SPACE” has E (forbidden).

“SCAMP” has M and P, but also contains M, P.

“SCRAM” – contains R, A, C, M:  
- S ✓, C in 3, A in 4.  
- A is in 4 (allowed), C is in 3 (allowed).  
- Uses M (not yet tested).  
- No forbidden letters.

“SCRAM” fits all constraints.

From the three rounds:

1. SLATE → S ✓, L x, A –, T x, E x  
   – Word starts with S  
   – Contains A (but A not in position 3)  
   – L, T, E are not in the word  

2. SNACK → S ✓, N x, A –, C –, K x  
   – C is in the word but not in position 4  
   – N, K are not in the word  

3. SCRAM → S ✓, C ✓, R ✓, A ✓, M x  
   – All letters except the last are correct and in the correct positions!  
   – Pattern so far: S C R A _  
   – M is not in the word, so the last letter must be something else.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SCRA and has one more letter that is not M, L, T, E, N, K.  
Looking at common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, P, etc.

Common words starting with SCRA:  
- SCRAB (Scrabble word, but not common)  
- SCRAG  
- SCRAM (already tried)  
- SCRAP  
- SCRAW  
- SCRAY

The most common one is SCRAP.

Let's verify:  
- SCRAP: S C R A P  
- Conforms to S ✓, C ✓, R ✓, A ✓, and P is allowed (not in the forbidden set).  
- This seems to be the only logical remaining guess.
