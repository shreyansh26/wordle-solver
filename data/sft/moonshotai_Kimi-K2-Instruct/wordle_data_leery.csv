### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters and can provide maximum information. Good starting words often contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", I'm choosing ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to identify which vowels are in the word and get some consonant feedback as well.

- A: NOT in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)

- S: NOT in the word (x)

1. The letters A, O, S are completely absent.
2. The letters R and E are present, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

- Contains both R and E
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Places R somewhere other than position 2
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Let’s try a word like “TREND”:
- T, N, D are common consonants not yet ruled out.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R isn’t in position 2 from the feedback, so this is bad).

Next idea: “ENTER”:
- Has E and R
- No A, O, S

- N, D are not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (position 2).
- R is still in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now have:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ Y
- Letters in the word: E, R, Y
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, D
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it’s not in 2 or 3 from feedback? Wait, let’s double-check:
   - In AROSE, R was position 2 (-) - so R not in position 2.
   - In NERDY, R was position 3 (-) - so R not in position 3.
   - So R must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible letters left to try: T, L, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

- RELAY (but A is out)
- REPAY (but A is out)
- REDLY (D is out)
- RENEY (not a word)
- REEFY (F is ok)
- REEKY (K is ok)

R E E K Y: Has two E’s - but we only know one E is confirmed in position 2. We don’t know if there’s another E, but it’s possible. However, we should prioritize words with no duplicate letters to maximize info.

Alternative: R E C K Y - not a word.
R E L K Y - not a word.
R E B B Y - not valid.

- BERRY (but double R)
- VERRY (not valid)

Not working. Maybe:
- H E R R Y - double R.

This path seems problematic. Maybe R is in position 1 with single E:

Other possibilities:

- R E F T Y - not valid

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words with pattern E in position 2, Y in position 5, and R somewhere else (positions 1 or 4), avoiding A, O, S, N, D.

4. R E B E Y - invalid (A out, but B is ok)
5. R E P E Y - invalid
6. R E M E Y - invalid

   - E in position 3 - we don’t know about second E

LEERY is a valid word that fits all constraints:
