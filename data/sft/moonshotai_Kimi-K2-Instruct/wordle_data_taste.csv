For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers 5 very common letters and has good vowel placement.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter must be T
- E is in the correct position (✓) → 5th letter must be E

So the target word looks like: _ _ _ T E
Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L

We need a 5-letter word that ends in TE, contains S somewhere not in position 1, and A somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ A T E → but S can't be position 1
- _ S A T E → SA at 2-3
- A _ S T E → S at 4 is already T, so invalid
- _ A S T E → A at 2, S at 3

Looking at common words:
- CHATE (invalid)
- STATE → has S at 1 (invalid), A at 3 (invalid)
- PASTE → A at 2 (ok), S at 3 (ok), ends with TE
- HASTE → same pattern as PASTE
- WASTE → same

PASTE seems like a good candidate:
- P A S T E

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

I'll choose SLATE as it covers 5 very common letters and has good vowel placement.

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter must be T
- E is in the correct position (✓) → 5th letter must be E

So the target word looks like: _ _ _ T E
Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L

We need a 5-letter word that ends in TE, contains S somewhere not in position 1, and A somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ A T E → but S can't be position 1
- _ S A T E → SA at 2-3
- A _ S T E → S at 4 is already T, so invalid
- _ A S T E → A at 2, S at 3

Looking at common words:
- CHATE (invalid)
- STATE → has S at 1 (invalid), A at 3 (invalid)
- PASTE → A at 2 (ok), S at 3 (ok), ends with TE
- HASTE → same pattern as PASTE
- WASTE → same

PASTE seems like a good candidate:
- P A S T E
- S is in position 3 (allowed since feedback only said S was wrong at position 1)
- A is in position 2 (allowed since feedback only said A was wrong at position 3)

All feedback so far tells us the word is of the form _ A S T E and the first letter is NOT S, L, P, C, H, or W.

Valid first letters we have not yet tried for position 1:
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

Among the endings in ASTE, the only common dictionary word left is BASTE. 

Therefore, the secret word must be BASTE.
