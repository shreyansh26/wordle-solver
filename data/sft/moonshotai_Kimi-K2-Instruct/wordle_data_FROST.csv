For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common choices include words with vowels and frequently used consonants. Good starting words often have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
- No repeating letters to maximize information

Some popular starting words are:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - focuses on vowels
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly strong because:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) to quickly identify vowel usage
2. Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct
4. Covers a good spread of positions for these letters

Therefore, ARISE seems like an optimal first guess to maximize information gathering.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position, 2nd letter (✓)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: correct position, 4th letter (✓)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ S _
- Letters not in word: A, I, E
- Letters in word and already placed: R (pos2), S (pos4)

We need a five-letter word fitting _ R _ S _ using only remaining letters (no A, I, E). Good next guesses should test common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated.

Common remaining vowels: O, U
Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, H, C, D, B, M, P, G, K, etc.

Possible candidates:  
- TROTS (but double T, not ideal)
- CROSS (but double S, already know S is at pos4)
- BRIOS (but I is out)
- PROUD (but U is good, D could fit)
- BROOK (but O repeated, K not tested)
- CRUST (but U is good, C, T, not tested)

The word should fit _ R _ S _ using new letters. Let’s pick FROST:
- F: not tested yet
- R: already correct at pos2
- O: not tested yet (good remaining vowel)
- S: already correct at pos4
- T: not tested yet

FROST fits the pattern and introduces new letters F, O, T to gather more info.
