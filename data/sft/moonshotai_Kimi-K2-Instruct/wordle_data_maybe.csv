For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include vowels to identify which vowels are present
3. Include common consonants to test their presence
4. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some effective starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". These use very common letters and cover most vowels and common consonants. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- These letters appear in many common 5-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct last position (✓ at position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).

So:
- 5th letter is E (fixed).
- A exists somewhere in positions 1-4.
- R, O, S are ruled out.
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses none of R, O, S.
4. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""PLACE"" – uses P, L, C, A, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""CABLE"" – uses C, A, B, L, E. Contains A (correct position is unknown), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""FLAME"" – uses F, L, A, M, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.

I'll choose ""PLACE"" because it tests common consonants P, L, C and keeps A in position 2 (since we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include vowels to identify which vowels are present
3. Include common consonants to test their presence
4. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some effective starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". These use very common letters and cover most vowels and common consonants. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- These letters appear in many common 5-letter words

- E is in the correct last position (✓ at position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).

So:
- 5th letter is E (fixed).
- A exists somewhere in positions 1-4.
- R, O, S are ruled out.
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses none of R, O, S.
4. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""PLACE"" – uses P, L, C, A, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""CABLE"" – uses C, A, B, L, E. Contains A (correct position is unknown), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""FLAME"" – uses F, L, A, M, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.

I'll choose ""PLACE"" because it tests common consonants P, L, C and keeps A in position 2 (since we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback).

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E.

- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ E
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E

I need a word that tests these possibilities while introducing new common letters. The most common remaining consonants are B, D, F, G, H, M, N, T, etc.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,maybe,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include vowels to identify which vowels are present
3. Include common consonants to test their presence
4. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some effective starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". These use very common letters and cover most vowels and common consonants. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- These letters appear in many common 5-letter words

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct last position (✓ at position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).

So:
- 5th letter is E (fixed).
- A exists somewhere in positions 1-4.
- R, O, S are ruled out.
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses none of R, O, S.
4. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""PLACE"" – uses P, L, C, A, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""CABLE"" – uses C, A, B, L, E. Contains A (correct position is unknown), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.
- ""FLAME"" – uses F, L, A, M, E. Contains A (not in position 1), ends with E, avoids R,O,S.

I'll choose ""PLACE"" because it tests common consonants P, L, C and keeps A in position 2 (since we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback).

<guess>PLACE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLACE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Analysis of feedback so far:

1. AROSE: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct in position 5.
   - A exists but is NOT in position 1 (from first guess) and NOT in position 3 (from second guess).

2. PLACE: P(x) L(x) A(-) C(x) E(✓)
   - E still correct in position 5.
   - A exists but is NOT in position 3 (confirmed from both guesses).
   - P, L, C are out.
   - R, O, S were already out.

Current constraints:
- Word ends with E.
- Must contain A, and A is in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 or 3).
- Cannot use: A (in positions 1,3), R, O, S, P, L, C.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since A must be in position 2 or 4:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ E
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E

I need a word that tests these possibilities while introducing new common letters. The most common remaining consonants are B, D, F, G, H, M, N, T, etc.

Good candidates:
- ""BAGEL"" – but L is out.
- ""DANCE"" – but C is out.
- ""GAMER"" – but R is out and E is already fixed at end.
- ""FRAME"" – R is out.
- ""HASTE"" – S is out.
- ""MANGE"" – N, G, M are new, A in position 2, E at end. Uses no forbidden letters.
- ""TAKEN"" – but N is at end and E is already fixed there.

""MANGE"" seems good:
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses new letters M, N, G.
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

Alternative: ""FAKER"" – but R is out.
""WATER"" – R is out.
""VAGUE"" – U is less common.

""MANGE"" is the best choice here.

5. Already-eliminated letters: R, O, S, P, L, C, N, G.

Word pattern so far: M A _ _ E

Remaining letters to test (excluding the eliminated ones):
- Position 3: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same pool, but must combine with position 3 to form a valid 5-letter word.

Common, high-frequency letters still available: B, D, F, H, I, K, T.

Candidate completions:
- M A D _ E → MADGE (G eliminated), MADRE (R eliminated)
- M A T _ E → MATTE (T twice), MATHE (H not yet tested)
- M A K _ E → MAKER (R eliminated), MAKE? (need valid word)
- M A D D E → Not a word
- M A F _ E → MAFIE (valid), MAFIA (A already used in position 2)

Best valid options:
- M A T H E → ""MATHE"" (rare, but valid variant of ""math"")
- M A B E L → ""MABEL"" (proper noun, likely invalid)
- M A K E R → ""MAKER"" (R eliminated)
- M A D G E → ""MADGE"" (G eliminated)
- M A F I E → ""MAFIE"" (valid spelling variant of ""maffia"", but obscure)
- M A D D E → Invalid
- M A T T E → Valid word ""MATTE""

""MATTE"" uses T twice. While T hasn't been tested, double letters give less new information. Next best is ""MADGE"" but G is out. 

The most common, valid word is ""MAPLE"", but L and P are eliminated. 

Looking again: ""MACHE"" (H not tested, C eliminated).
""MABLE"" (B not tested, L eliminated).
""MAIZE"" (Z not tested, valid word).

""MAIZE"" is a common, valid word:
- M (✓), A (✓), I (new), Z (new), E (✓).
- Uses no eliminated letters.
- Tests new letters I and Z.

Other valid options:
- ""MAYBE"" (Y and B new)
- ""MAGIC"" (C eliminated)
- ""MAJOR"" (R eliminated)

""MAIZE"" seems optimal for testing new letters.

Scanning again carefully, the only remaining common English word that fits is:

M A J E T – but T is out.

Actually, the only valid word left seems to be **MAFIE** (a variant spelling of MAFIA), but I is out.

Wait – let me list every possible C-V-C pattern:

M A [consonant] [consonant] E

Remaining usable consonants: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W.

Possible combos:

- M A W Q E – not a word

None of these consonant pairs form a valid English word ending in E.

But I missed one: **MAVIE** – but I is out.

Another: **MABES** – S is out.

Wait – let me check **MABEE** – no.

Actually, the only remaining valid English word that fits is **MAVIE** (slang for a movie), but we already know I is out.

Back to basics: the only consonants left are B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W.

Let me check dictionary-valid 5-letter words that fit M A _ _ E:

- **MABEL** – L is out
- **MABES** – S is out
- **MAFIA** – I is out
- **MAFIC** – ends in C, C is out
- **MAGEE** – G is out
- **MAHEM** – ends in M
- **MAKER** – R is out
- **MAKES** – S is out
- **MAVEN** – N is out
- **MAVIS** – S is out
- **MAVIE** – I is out
- **MAYBE** – Y is unused, B is unused, E is fixed at 5 – “MAYBE” fits!

“MAYBE” is a valid word:

- M(✓) A(✓) Y(?) B(?) E(✓)

It uses the untested letters Y and B in positions 3 and 4, respectively.

This is the only common 5-letter word left that fits the pattern and uses only untested letters.

Therefore, the final guess must be:

<guess>MAYBE</guess>
</think>

<guess>MAYBE</guess>",MAYBE,"From the latest feedback:

M A T E D  
M(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(-) D(x)

- M, A, E are all in their correct positions (1, 2, 5).
- E is therefore **not** in position 4, so it must be in position 5 only.
- T and D are now eliminated.

Thus the word pattern is:

M A _ _ E

Letters already eliminated:  
R, O, S, P, L, C, N, G, I, Z, T, D.

Untested consonants left: B, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y.
