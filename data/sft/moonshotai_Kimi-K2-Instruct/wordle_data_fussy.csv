This is the first guess, so I have no information about the secret word. A good opening guess should contain common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present.

From both guesses we now have:

- Pattern so far: _ U _ S _   (S is known to appear in the word; its position is uncertain.)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, H, M, P
- Letters still “in play”: all of the others, but especially those tried so far:  
  – S must appear somewhere (because it got “-” in the 5th spot, so it’s somewhere else).  
  – U is confirmed in the 2nd position.

So the word looks like: _ U _ S _ and we need to decide where S actually sits (and what the other letters are).

To get maximum new information, pick a word that:
1. keeps U in slot 2,
2. moves S to a new position (e.g., 1st or 3rd),
3. introduces the next-most-common unused letters (T, N, L, I, D, Y, C, etc.).

A strong candidate is “DUSTY”:
- D, T, Y are still untested and common.
- U stays in slot 2.
- S moves to slot 3.
This pattern checks all the constraints and maximizes new-letter coverage.

From the previous feedback:

3. DUSTY → U is in position 2 (✓), S is in position 3 (✓), and Y is in position 5 (✓).

So far we have:
- Word pattern: _ U S _ Y
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, H, M, P, D, T
- Still allowed letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones).

Looking at the remaining pattern _ U S _ Y, we need a 1st and 4th letter from the allowed set. Common letters left are L, N, I, C, G, etc.

Possible candidates:
- LUSKY (but K is less common)
- NUSKY (same issue)
- FUSNY (F and N are okay)
- GUSPY (G, P already ruled out)
- LUSLY (double L is unlikely)
- BUSKY (B is okay, K is okay)
- BUSHY (H is ruled out)

The best seems to be ""BUSKY"" - uses B, K which are still allowed and checks the pattern.

3. DUSTY → U is in position 2 (✓), S is in position 3 (✓), and Y is in position 5 (✓).

So far we have:
- Word pattern: _ U S _ Y
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, H, M, P, D, T
- Still allowed letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones).

Looking at the remaining pattern _ U S _ Y, we need a 1st and 4th letter from the allowed set. Common letters left are L, N, I, C, G, etc.

Possible candidates:
- LUSKY (but K is less common)
- NUSKY (same issue)
- FUSNY (F and N are okay)
- GUSPY (G, P already ruled out)
- LUSLY (double L is unlikely)
- BUSKY (B is okay, K is okay)
- BUSHY (H is ruled out)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,fussy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no information about the secret word. A good opening guess should contain common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. Among these, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback from guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the word is _ _ _ S _.  
We know:
1. It contains S in position 4.
2. It does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Next, I should pick a word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, N, L, C, D, U, I, Y, etc.).
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

A good choice is ""HUMPS"":
- H, U, M, P, S all avoid the ruled-out letters.
- Tries H, U, M, P to test new common letters.
- Keeps S in the 4th position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now have:

- Pattern so far: _ U _ S _   (S is known to appear in the word; its position is uncertain.)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, H, M, P
- Letters still “in play”: all of the others, but especially those tried so far:  
  – S must appear somewhere (because it got “-” in the 5th spot, so it’s somewhere else).  
  – U is confirmed in the 2nd position.

So the word looks like: _ U _ S _ and we need to decide where S actually sits (and what the other letters are).

To get maximum new information, pick a word that:
1. keeps U in slot 2,
2. moves S to a new position (e.g., 1st or 3rd),
3. introduces the next-most-common unused letters (T, N, L, I, D, Y, C, etc.).

A strong candidate is “DUSTY”:
- D, T, Y are still untested and common.
- U stays in slot 2.
- S moves to slot 3.
This pattern checks all the constraints and maximizes new-letter coverage.

We now know the exact positions and letters:

- Pattern: _ U S _ Y

- Still allowed and common for the 1st and 4th slots: C, F, G, I, L, N, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has S in position 3.
3. Has Y in position 5.
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set for positions 1 and 4.

Trying common letters left:

Position 4: C, F, G, I, L, N, V, W …

Quick scan:
- FUSKY – but K already ruled out.
- CUSPY – P already ruled out.
- GUSHY – H ruled out.
- NUSKY – K ruled out.
- LUSKY – K ruled out.
- FUSLY – not a recognized word.

Now test “FUSSY” – but duplicate S in positions 3 & 4, and FUSSY is a real word.
Check letters: F (allowed), U, S (allowed), S (allowed), Y (allowed) – none are on the banned list.

“FUSSY” fits the pattern:
- F _ U _ S _ S _ Y → actually positions 1,2,3,4,5: F U S S Y

This satisfies:
- U in 2, S in 3, Y in 5.
