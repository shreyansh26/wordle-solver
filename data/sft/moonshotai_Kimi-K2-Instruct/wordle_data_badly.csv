For the first guess, I need to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that will help me narrow down possibilities quickly. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency letters. 

Some strong opening words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with STARE because it contains 5 of the most common letters (S, T, A, R, E), giving me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- S, T, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the third position (-).

So the secret word contains the letter A somewhere, but not as its third letter, and it does not contain S, T, R, or E.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y
Common vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U

Since A must be placed somewhere except position 3, I should test a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Uses fresh consonants from the remaining pool.
3. Adds another high-frequency vowel (I or O).

A solid choice is CANAL:
- C, N, L are fresh consonants.
- A appears twice, which checks different positions (1 and 3, but since A can’t be in position 3 per feedback, this gives info).
- But A is in position 3 here, which we know is invalid.

Better: A is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5. Try COBIA:
- C, B, O, I are fresh letters.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
But ""COBIA"" might be too obscure.

A more common word: MANGO:
- M, N, G, O are fresh letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that will help me narrow down possibilities quickly. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency letters. 

Some strong opening words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with STARE because it contains 5 of the most common letters (S, T, A, R, E), giving me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, T, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the third position (-).

So the secret word contains the letter A somewhere, but not as its third letter, and it does not contain S, T, R, or E.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y
Common vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U

Since A must be placed somewhere except position 3, I should test a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Uses fresh consonants from the remaining pool.
3. Adds another high-frequency vowel (I or O).

A solid choice is CANAL:
- C, N, L are fresh consonants.
- A appears twice, which checks different positions (1 and 3, but since A can’t be in position 3 per feedback, this gives info).
- But A is in position 3 here, which we know is invalid.

Better: A is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5. Try COBIA:
- C, B, O, I are fresh letters.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
But ""COBIA"" might be too obscure.

A more common word: MANGO:
- M, N, G, O are fresh letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems optimal.

2. A is confirmed in the word AND is now known to be in position 2 (✓).

Letters already ruled out: S, T, R, E, M, N, G, O.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A is already placed)

I want a word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Uses fresh consonants from the remaining pool.  
- Adds the remaining high-frequency vowels (I or U) if possible.

Candidate words:  
- CABIN – C, B, I, N (but N is already ruled out).  
- LAUGH – L, U, G, H (G is ruled out).  
- BASIC – B, S (ruled out).

- CANDY – C, N, D, Y (N is ruled out).  
- DAIRY – D, I, R, Y (R is ruled out).  
- VAPID – V, P, I, D (all letters fresh).  

Among these, “VAPID” seems strong because:
- A is in position 2 (matches).  
- V, P, I, D are all fresh letters.  
- It’s a common word.

Therefore, I’ll guess VAPID.

- Position 2 = A

Letters definitely in the word: A, D, Y

So the word pattern is: _ A D _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that matches “_ A D _ Y”.

Possible choices:
- BADLY – but L is still allowed.
- CADGY – C, G already ruled out.
- FADDY – F allowed, but double D; we already know D is in position 3, so another D is possible but the feedback from CADDY shows only one D is “✓”, the other is “-”, meaning exactly one D exists in the word. So FADDY is invalid.
- HADJI – J is uncommon and I ruled out.
- LADEN – N ruled out.
- MADLY – M ruled out.
- SADLY – S ruled out.
- WADDY – showed two D’s; invalid.
- BADDY – same double-D issue.

The only clean candidate left that fits “_ A D _ Y” with single D and only allowed letters is BADLY (B, A, D, L, Y). All letters are still allowed.
