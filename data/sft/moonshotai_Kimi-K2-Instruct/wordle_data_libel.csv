### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants.

Common letters in English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C

A popular starting word choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the target word and narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has no A, R, O, or S.
2. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses other common consonants we haven't tried yet (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

Good letters to try now: T, N, L, I, C, D, H, U.

- It has E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- It uses new common letters: U, N, T, I.

From the latest feedback on FIELD:

- F and D are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 2.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is NOT in position 3.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so L is NOT in position 4.

Summarizing everything so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, D.

Letters that ARE in the word:
- I is locked in position 2 (I _ _ _ _).
- E must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5 (due to previous feedback).
- L must appear somewhere, but not in position 4.

Possible positions left for E and L:
Since E cannot be in 3 or 5, it must be in 1 or 4.
Since L cannot be in 4, it must be in 1, 3, or 5.

We have the pattern: I _ _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Contains both E and L exactly once each.
3. Does not contain any banned letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, D).
4. E must be in 1 or 4.
5. L must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s explore possible placements:

Case 1: E in 1, L in 3 or 5

- _ I L E _ (but L cannot be in 4, ok here)
- _ I _ E L

Valid patterns:
- E I L _ _
- E I _ _ L
- L I _ E _
- _ I L E _
- _ I _ E L

Now, we need letters that are not banned. Available letters (from common ones):
Vowels: E, I (already used), so none new.
Consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s pick one of the patterns and fill with common consonants.

Possible: E I L K Y → ""EILKY"" – but this seems obscure.
Another: E I L V E – repeats E, invalid.
Another: C I V E L – but I must be in position 2.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,libel,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants.

Common letters in English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C

A popular starting word choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the target word and narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has no A, R, O, or S.
2. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses other common consonants we haven't tried yet (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

Good letters to try now: T, N, L, I, C, D, H, U.

A strong second guess candidate is ""UNTIE"" because:
- It has E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- It uses new common letters: U, N, T, I.
- It avoids all the letters we know aren't in the word (A, R, O, S).

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(-)
   - U, N, T are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known constraints so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word: E (not 5th), I (not 4th).
- Still need 5 different letters; we have only identified E and I so far.

Remaining common consonants to try: D, L, C, H, K, M, P, B, G, V, Y, W, F.
Remaining vowels: none except E and I already known.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Must include both E and I.
- Must place E in positions 1-4 (not 5).
- Must place I in positions 1-3 or 5 (not 4).
- Must avoid all banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Let’s pick a word that meets these rules and introduces new, common consonants. A good candidate is “FIELD”:
- Contains both E and I.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- Letters F, L, D haven’t been ruled out and are common.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   → I is in the word, but not in position 4.  
   → E is in the word, but not in position 5 (confirms first guess).

3. FIELD → F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(-) D(x)  
   → I is in the word and must be in position 2.  
   → E is in the word, but not in position 3.  
   → L is in the word, but not in position 4.

4. WILEY → W(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) Y(x)  
   → I confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
   → E is in the word and is now in the correct position 4 (✓).  
   → L is in the word but not in position 3; must appear elsewhere.  
   → W and Y are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: unknown letter.
- Position 2: I (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown letter (L could be here, but we haven’t fixed it yet).
- Position 4: E (fixed).
- Position 5: unknown letter; L could be here.

Letters confirmed in the word: I, E, L.  
Letters excluded from the word entirely: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, D, W, Y.

Remaining consonants to consider: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, Z (and others, but only these are common enough).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and E in position 4.
- Contains L exactly once, and L cannot be in position 3 (from FIELD) or 4 (already E). So L must be in position 1 or 5.
- Must not use any excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
1. L I _ E _
2. _ I _ E L

We now try to find valid English words matching either pattern.

Pattern 1: L I _ E _
Letters left for _ are any allowed consonants except excluded ones.  
Possible candidates:  
- L I B E _ → “LIBEL” (but it has 5 letters: L I B E L) — this works and is valid.

Pattern 2: _ I _ E L  
Letters left for _ are any allowed consonants.  
Possible candidates:  
- B I V E L (not a word)  
- C I V E L (not a word)  
- G I V E L (not a word)  
- H I V E L (not a word)  
- M I V E L (not a word)  
- P I V E L (not a word)  
- V I V E L (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting both the constraints and English dictionary is “LIBEL”.

Let's check “LIBEL”:
- L I B E L  
  → positions: 1=L (allowed), 2=I (fixed), 3=B (new letter), 4=E (fixed), 5=L (allowed because L must be somewhere and isn’t excluded from position 5).  
  → contains I, E, L exactly as required.  
  → all letters used are not excluded.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “LIBEL”.
