For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, and ideally no repeating letters to maximize information per letter.

After considering common options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a good balance of common consonants and vowels. The letters C, R, A, N, E are all quite frequent in English words and this will help me quickly identify what letters might be in the secret word.

- A is correctly placed in position 2.
- R is still in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRANE and EARLY together).
- L, Y are out.

So we know:

- The word contains R (positions left: 1, 3, 4, 5) and E (positions left: 2, 3, 4).
- Letters tried and rejected so far: C, N, L, Y.

We need a word with:
- _ A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- Contains R and E somewhere else (not positions already excluded)
- Uses new consonants for positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible positions for R and E:
Since A is fixed in 2, and E can't be in 5, E could be 1, 3, or 4.

3. From RAISE:
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (now excluded from positions 1, 2, 3, 4).
   - A is correctly in position 2 (confirms A2).
   - I is not in the word.
   - S is not in the word.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 5 (already excluded from 1, 5).

Summary of constraints:
- Word form: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R and E exactly once each.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 ⇒ R must be in position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters already ruled out: C, N, L, Y, I, S.

Since R must be in position 5, the word is: _ A _ _ R.

E must be in 3 or 4. Let's try E in 3 first:
Form: _ A E _ R.

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4. Common remaining consonants: D, G, M, T, etc.

Try ""D A E T R"" → ""DAETR"" is not a word.
Try ""M A E T R"" → ""MAETR"" not valid.
Try ""G A E T R"" → ""GAETR"" not valid.
Try ""F A E T R"" → ""FAETR"" not valid.
Try ""B A E T R"" → ""BAETR"" not valid.

Next possibility: E in position 4, form: _ A _ E R.

Now we need consonants for positions 1 and 3. Suitable letters: D, G, M, T, etc.

Try ""D A M E R"" → ""DAMER"" not a word.
Try ""G A M E R"" → ""GAMER"" is a valid word.

Check GAMER:
- G: new letter (ok)
- A: position 2 (matches ✓)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,water,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, and ideally no repeating letters to maximize information per letter.

After considering common options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a good balance of common consonants and vowels. The letters C, R, A, N, E are all quite frequent in English words and this will help me quickly identify what letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word contains:
- R, A, E somewhere, but:
  - R ≠ position 2
  - A ≠ position 3
  - E ≠ position 5

Letters to avoid: C, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C or N
- Contains R, A, E
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

A good next step is to rearrange R, A, E along with two other fresh common consonants. Let me try ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (okay, since E ≠ 5)
- A is in position 2 (okay, since A ≠ 3)
- R is in position 3 (okay, since R ≠ 2)
- Uses new consonants L, Y to test new letters

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two pieces of feedback.

From CRANE:
- C, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

From EARLY:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is correctly placed in position 2.
- R is still in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRANE and EARLY together).
- L, Y are out.

So we know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- The word contains R (positions left: 1, 3, 4, 5) and E (positions left: 2, 3, 4).
- Letters tried and rejected so far: C, N, L, Y.

We need a word with:
- _ A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- Contains R and E somewhere else (not positions already excluded)
- Uses new consonants for positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible positions for R and E:
Since A is fixed in 2, and E can't be in 5, E could be 1, 3, or 4.
R can't be in 2, 3, or 4, so R must be in 1 or 5.

Let's try R in 1 and E in 3:
R A E _ _

Now we need two new consonants for positions 4 and 5. Common unused ones: S, T, D, M, etc.
""RAESM"" isn't a word, but ""RAISE"" is valid.

Check:
- R in 1: allowed (wasn't excluded before)
- A in 2: matches feedback
- E in 3: allowed (wasn't excluded)
- S, I: new letters

This seems like a strong guess.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ E R and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the letters above.

Remaining consonants not yet used or excluded:
B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Remaining vowels not yet used or excluded:
O, U

Possible three-letter combinations for positions 1 and 3 that make a valid 5-letter word:
- Position 1: any of the remaining consonants
- Position 3: any of the remaining vowels or consonants not ruled out

Common valid words fitting _ A _ E R:
- B A K E R
- B A T E R
- D A T E R
- F A T E R
- P A P E R
- P A V E R
- T A T E R
- W A T E R

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,water,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, and ideally no repeating letters to maximize information per letter.

After considering common options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a good balance of common consonants and vowels. The letters C, R, A, N, E are all quite frequent in English words and this will help me quickly identify what letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word contains:
- R, A, E somewhere, but:
  - R ≠ position 2
  - A ≠ position 3
  - E ≠ position 5

Letters to avoid: C, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C or N
- Contains R, A, E
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

A good next step is to rearrange R, A, E along with two other fresh common consonants. Let me try ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (okay, since E ≠ 5)
- A is in position 2 (okay, since A ≠ 3)
- R is in position 3 (okay, since R ≠ 2)
- Uses new consonants L, Y to test new letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two pieces of feedback.

From CRANE:
- C, N are out.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From EARLY:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is correctly placed in position 2.
- R is still in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRANE and EARLY together).
- L, Y are out.

So we know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- The word contains R (positions left: 1, 3, 4, 5) and E (positions left: 2, 3, 4).
- Letters tried and rejected so far: C, N, L, Y.

We need a word with:
- _ A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- Contains R and E somewhere else (not positions already excluded)
- Uses new consonants for positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible positions for R and E:
Since A is fixed in 2, and E can't be in 5, E could be 1, 3, or 4.
R can't be in 2, 3, or 4, so R must be in 1 or 5.

Let's try R in 1 and E in 3:
R A E _ _

Now we need two new consonants for positions 4 and 5. Common unused ones: S, T, D, M, etc.
""RAESM"" isn't a word, but ""RAISE"" is valid.

Check:
- R in 1: allowed (wasn't excluded before)
- A in 2: matches feedback
- E in 3: allowed (wasn't excluded)
- S, I: new letters

This seems like a strong guess.

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have three rounds of feedback.

1. From CRANE:
   - C, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. From EARLY:
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is correctly in position 2 (✓).
   - R is still in the word but not in position 3, 4 (it was already excluded from 2 by CRANE).
   - L, Y are not in the word.

3. From RAISE:
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1 (now excluded from positions 1, 2, 3, 4).
   - A is correctly in position 2 (confirms A2).
   - I is not in the word.
   - S is not in the word.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 5 (already excluded from 1, 5).

Summary of constraints:
- Word form: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R and E exactly once each.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 ⇒ R must be in position 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 ⇒ E must be in position 3 or 4.
- Letters already ruled out: C, N, L, Y, I, S.

Since R must be in position 5, the word is: _ A _ _ R.

E must be in 3 or 4. Let's try E in 3 first:
Form: _ A E _ R.

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4. Common remaining consonants: D, G, M, T, etc.

Try ""D A E T R"" → ""DAETR"" is not a word.
Try ""M A E T R"" → ""MAETR"" not valid.
Try ""G A E T R"" → ""GAETR"" not valid.
Try ""F A E T R"" → ""FAETR"" not valid.
Try ""B A E T R"" → ""BAETR"" not valid.

Next possibility: E in position 4, form: _ A _ E R.

Now we need consonants for positions 1 and 3. Suitable letters: D, G, M, T, etc.

Try ""D A M E R"" → ""DAMER"" not a word.
Try ""G A M E R"" → ""GAMER"" is a valid word.

Check GAMER:
- G: new letter (ok)
- A: position 2 (matches ✓)
- M: new letter (ok)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- R: position 5 (required by constraints)

This fits all known constraints.

   - Position 4 = E ✓
   - Position 5 = R ✓

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   C, N, L, Y, I, S, G, M

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ A _ E R and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the letters above.

Remaining consonants not yet used or excluded:
B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Remaining vowels not yet used or excluded:
O, U

Possible three-letter combinations for positions 1 and 3 that make a valid 5-letter word:
- Position 1: any of the remaining consonants
- Position 3: any of the remaining vowels or consonants not ruled out

- B A K E R
- B A T E R
- D A T E R
- F A T E R
- P A P E R
- P A V E R
- T A T E R
- W A T E R
