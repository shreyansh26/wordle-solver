For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. A good first word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeated letters

Some popular strong first words include: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, ADIEU, RAISE. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters across different positions.

Let me update the state of knowledge after the THING feedback.

From Guess 3 (THING → T(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)):

- T, H, G are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but now appears NOT in position 3 (-).  
  Earlier we knew I is in slot 2 (from LINED), so this is consistent.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  (We already knew N is not in position 3, and E is in slot 4, so N must be in slot 1 or 5.)

Summary so far:
Known letters in fixed positions:
- slot 2: I
- slot 4: E

Known letters somewhere in word:
- N (must be slot 1 or 5)

Known letters NOT in word:
C, R, A, L, D, T, H, G

Still allowed letters (unused common ones): S, U, B, K, M, O, Y, etc.

Pattern to test: either
N I _ E _   or   _ I _ E N

Let’s pick a valid word matching one of these patterns using allowed letters.

For pattern N I _ E _ we need a 3rd consonant and a 5th consonant from the remaining pool.  
Example valid words: N I K E S, N I M E S, etc.  But NIkES is a brand, NI MES is not a word.

For pattern _ I _ E N we can try S I M E N (SIMEN – archaic but listed), K I L E N (invalid), P I C E N (invalid), etc.

The valid word “M I N E S” doesn’t fit the pattern (E is not in slot 4).

A valid word that fits _ I _ E N and uses only allowed letters is “W I N E S”… but W hasn’t been tested yet and is allowed.

Another valid word: “S I L E N” is invalid.

Actually “S I N E W” fits the pattern _ I _ E N and uses only S, I, N, E, W.  
- S hasn't been ruled out.
- W hasn’t been ruled out.
- N is in slot 5 (allowed).
- I in slot 2 (fixed).
- E in slot 4 (fixed).

So SINEW is a good candidate.

Check again:  
Allowed letters: S, U, B, K, M, O, Y, W, F, V, etc.  
SINEW uses S, I, N, E, W – none forbidden.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,widen,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. A good first word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeated letters

Some popular strong first words include: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, ADIEU, RAISE. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters across different positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x)
- N and E ARE in the word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions (-)

So we now know:
- The word contains N and E
- N is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5
- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all

I want a new word that:
1. Uses N and E (the confirmed letters)
2. Avoids C, R, A (the eliminated letters)
3. Uses new letters to test more possibilities

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

A good next word would be something like ""SNEKY"" or ""TENGE"", but those aren't valid. Let me think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- N and E must appear
- No C, R, A
- Other letters should be common ones not yet tested

Valid words that come to mind: ""TUNES"", ""LENDS"", ""BENDS"", ""MINES"", ""LINED""

I'll choose ""LINED"" because:
- It has both N and E
- Uses new letters L, I, D
- N is in position 3 (not 4, which was eliminated)
- E is in position 4 (not 5, which was eliminated)

<guess>LINED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the additional feedback on LINED:
- L and D are NOT in the word (x)
- I and E ARE in the correct positions (✓)  
  – I is in slot 2
  – E is in slot 4
- N is in the word but not in slot 3 (-)

Updated state of knowledge:

Letters known to be in the word (with positions):
- I in position 2
- E in position 4

Letters known to be in the word but positions still unknown:
- N (only position 3 has been eliminated, so it can be 1, 4, or 5)
  – but position 4 is already taken by E, so N must be in 1 or 5

Letters known NOT in the word:
- C, R, A, L, D

Need a 5-letter word fitting pattern:
_ I _ E _
with an N in either slot 1 or 5, and other letters drawn from the remaining unused common letters.

Remaining likely letters (excluding the six already ruled out): S, T, O, U, B, G, H, M, K, etc.

Possible patterns:
N I _ E _  or  _ I _ E N

Let’s pick a valid word matching one of these.  
“THING” fits “_ I _ E N”:
- T, H not yet tested
- N in slot 5 (possible)
- I in slot 2 (correct)
- E in slot 4 (correct)

So THING satisfies all constraints and tests new letters T and H.

From the new feedback on SINEW:
- S and W are NOT in the word (x).
- I and E remain locked in positions 2 and 4 (√).
- N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (-).

Known facts after 4 guesses:
Letters in fixed positions:
  2: I
  4: E

Letters somewhere in word:
  N must be in position 1 (positions 3,4,5 are impossible; 2 is I).

Letters definitely absent:
  C, R, A, L, D, T, H, G, S, W

Allowed unused letters:
  B, F, K, M, O, U, V, Y

The pattern is therefore:
N I _ E _

We need a 3rd consonant and a 5th consonant from the remaining allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words fitting N I _ E _:
- N I B E L → not valid
- N I M E D → not valid
- N I K E D → not valid
- N I P E D → P used? No, P hasn’t been ruled out yet.

NIPED is archaic but listed; let’s choose the common word NIKED (a variant spelling) – no, invalid.

Actually, the only common valid word left is NIKED? No. Let’s list all N I _ E _ words in the dictionary.

Valid ones: NIKED (slang), NIPED, NIFER, NIKED is invalid. Wait, what about NIGER? G is ruled out. NIKED isn’t a standard word.

The only standard word remaining seems to be NINER (slang for 49er). But we already know N is only once, and we need a second new letter. Let’s check NIFER – not standard. NIKED – no. 

Actually, the valid common word ""NIXIE"" exists but has I in position 3 and E in 4, but we need I in 2 and E in 4.

Wait, let me simply list all valid English words matching N I _ E _:
- NITER
- NIFER (not valid)
- NIKED (no)
- NINER (valid, as in the 49ers)

NINER uses letters N,I,N,E,R – but R is already ruled out. So not valid.

Next valid word: NITER – R is already ruled out.

Next: NIKED – invalid.

Next: NIFER – invalid.

Hmm, perhaps NIBED – invalid.

Actually, the only valid remaining word fitting N I _ E _ with allowed letters is NIKED – but it’s not standard. Let me check the letters again.

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5 from: B, F, K, M, O, U, V, Y.

Let’s look for valid words:
- N I B E Y → NIBEY – invalid.
- N I B E M → NIBEM – invalid.
- N I B E K → NIBEK – invalid.
- N I F E K → NIFEK – invalid.
- N I M E Y → NIMEY – invalid.
- N I F E Y → NIFEY – invalid.
- N I K E M → NIKEM – invalid.

Actually, the correct word must be NIFER – but F is allowed and R is not. Wait, no. Let me think differently.

Wait, let me check the pattern again: N I _ E _.

Valid common English words are:
- NIKED – no.
- NITER – but R is out.
- NINER – but R is out.
- NIMED – invalid.
- NIBED – invalid.
- NIFED – invalid.
- NIVED – invalid.

Actually, I realize: the only valid word left with no ruled letters and fitting N I _ E _ is NIKED, which isn’t a standard word. So I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,widen,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. A good first word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeated letters

Some popular strong first words include: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, ADIEU, RAISE. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters across different positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (x)
- N and E ARE in the word, but not in the 4th and 5th positions (-)

So we now know:
- The word contains N and E
- N is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5
- The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all

I want a new word that:
1. Uses N and E (the confirmed letters)
2. Avoids C, R, A (the eliminated letters)
3. Uses new letters to test more possibilities

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

A good next word would be something like ""SNEKY"" or ""TENGE"", but those aren't valid. Let me think of valid 5-letter words that fit:
- N and E must appear
- No C, R, A
- Other letters should be common ones not yet tested

Valid words that come to mind: ""TUNES"", ""LENDS"", ""BENDS"", ""MINES"", ""LINED""

I'll choose ""LINED"" because:
- It has both N and E
- Uses new letters L, I, D
- N is in position 3 (not 4, which was eliminated)
- E is in position 4 (not 5, which was eliminated)

<guess>LINED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the additional feedback on LINED:
- L and D are NOT in the word (x)
- I and E ARE in the correct positions (✓)  
  – I is in slot 2
  – E is in slot 4
- N is in the word but not in slot 3 (-)

Updated state of knowledge:

Letters known to be in the word (with positions):
- I in position 2
- E in position 4

Letters known to be in the word but positions still unknown:
- N (only position 3 has been eliminated, so it can be 1, 4, or 5)
  – but position 4 is already taken by E, so N must be in 1 or 5

Letters known NOT in the word:
- C, R, A, L, D

Need a 5-letter word fitting pattern:
_ I _ E _
with an N in either slot 1 or 5, and other letters drawn from the remaining unused common letters.

Remaining likely letters (excluding the six already ruled out): S, T, O, U, B, G, H, M, K, etc.

Possible patterns:
N I _ E _  or  _ I _ E N

Let’s pick a valid word matching one of these.  
“THING” fits “_ I _ E N”:
- T, H not yet tested
- N in slot 5 (possible)
- I in slot 2 (correct)
- E in slot 4 (correct)

So THING satisfies all constraints and tests new letters T and H.

<guess>THING</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(-)
Guess 3: THING -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me update the state of knowledge after the THING feedback.

From Guess 3 (THING → T(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) G(x)):

- T, H, G are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but now appears NOT in position 3 (-).  
  Earlier we knew I is in slot 2 (from LINED), so this is consistent.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  (We already knew N is not in position 3, and E is in slot 4, so N must be in slot 1 or 5.)

Summary so far:
Known letters in fixed positions:
- slot 2: I
- slot 4: E

Known letters somewhere in word:
- N (must be slot 1 or 5)

Known letters NOT in word:
C, R, A, L, D, T, H, G

Still allowed letters (unused common ones): S, U, B, K, M, O, Y, etc.

Pattern to test: either
N I _ E _   or   _ I _ E N

Let’s pick a valid word matching one of these patterns using allowed letters.

For pattern N I _ E _ we need a 3rd consonant and a 5th consonant from the remaining pool.  
Example valid words: N I K E S, N I M E S, etc.  But NIkES is a brand, NI MES is not a word.

For pattern _ I _ E N we can try S I M E N (SIMEN – archaic but listed), K I L E N (invalid), P I C E N (invalid), etc.

The valid word “M I N E S” doesn’t fit the pattern (E is not in slot 4).

A valid word that fits _ I _ E N and uses only allowed letters is “W I N E S”… but W hasn’t been tested yet and is allowed.

Another valid word: “S I L E N” is invalid.

Actually “S I N E W” fits the pattern _ I _ E N and uses only S, I, N, E, W.  
- S hasn't been ruled out.
- W hasn’t been ruled out.
- N is in slot 5 (allowed).
- I in slot 2 (fixed).
- E in slot 4 (fixed).

So SINEW is a good candidate.

Check again:  
Allowed letters: S, U, B, K, M, O, Y, W, F, V, etc.  
SINEW uses S, I, N, E, W – none forbidden.

Let me go with SINEW.

Step 1 – restate what we know  
- Fixed letters:  
  – position 2 = I  
  – position 4 = E  

- Letter N is in the word but never yet placed correctly.  
  Possible positions for N (only 1 or 5 are still open).

- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, L, D, T, H, G, S, W

- So the pattern is either  
  N I _ E _   or   _ I _ E N

- The three blanks must be filled from the still-allowed set:  
  B, F, K, M, O, U, V, Y  (and maybe others, but these are common).

Step 2 – look for a valid English word that fits one of the two patterns and uses only the allowed letters.

Pattern N I _ E _  
 – NI_B_E_ or NI_F_E_ etc.  
   N I B E _ → NIBEX, NIBED (invalid)  
   N I F E _ → NIFED (invalid)  
   N I M E _ → NIMES (invalid)  
   None are valid 5-letter words.

Pattern _ I _ E N  
 – _ I _ E N with first and third letters from {B, F, K, M, O, U, V, Y}.  
   B I D E N → D is ruled out.  
   F I L E N → L is ruled out.  
   K I L E N → L is ruled out.  
   M I L E N → L is ruled out.  
   O I K E N → not a word.  
   U I D E N → D is ruled out.  
   V I L E N → L is ruled out.  
   Y I K E N → not a word.  

   One valid word appears: “V I N E S” → but S is already ruled out.  
   Another is “F I N E S” → S ruled out.  

   Finally, “M I N E D” → D ruled out.

   Check again: “P I N E D” → D ruled out.  
   “B I N E R” → R ruled out.  
   “K I N E S” → S ruled out.  

   “M I N E R” → R ruled out.  
   “F I N E R” → R ruled out.  

   “B I N E T” → T ruled out.

Step 3 – realize we missed a letter.  
We have not yet tried Y in position 3 with N in position 5.  
The word “V I Y E N” is invalid.  

Next, consider “B I N E Y” – but N must be in position 1 or 5, and here N is in position 3 (invalid).

Wait – re-examine allowed letters: we still have K and B and O etc.

Try “B I K E N” – that is a valid English word “BIKEN” (archaic plural of bike, but it is listed).

Check constraints:  
- B, I, K, E, N are all allowed.  
- Pattern _ I _ E N → positions: 1=B, 2=I, 3=K, 4=E, 5=N.  
- I and E are in correct positions.  
- N is finally in position 5, which has never been eliminated.  

So BIKE N looks like the safe next guess.
