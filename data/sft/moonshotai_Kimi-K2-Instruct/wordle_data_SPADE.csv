For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best opening words typically include common vowels and consonants. Some good options are:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses many vowels but fewer consonants)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""RAISE"" seems like a strong choice as it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word.

- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

Good letters to try next: consonants that are still in play (T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (only O and U are untested since A is already in). We want to place A and S in new positions while testing additional consonants.

A strategic second guess is “STANE”:
- S is now in position 1 (new location; old was 4).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best opening words typically include common vowels and consonants. Some good options are:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses many vowels but fewer consonants)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""RAISE"" seems like a strong choice as it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word, but not in the second position.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the final (5th) position.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. Contains A (not in position 2) and S (not in position 4).
3. Does NOT contain R or I.

Good letters to try next: consonants that are still in play (T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (only O and U are untested since A is already in). We want to place A and S in new positions while testing additional consonants.

A strategic second guess is “STANE”:
- S is now in position 1 (new location; old was 4).
- T tests a new common consonant.
- A is now in position 3 (old was 2).
- N tests another common consonant.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

This efficiently re-uses A and S while adding T and N and keeping E fixed.

<guess>STANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STANE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the updated feedback:

- First guess: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
  – E is fixed in position 5.
  – A and S are in the word but misplaced.

- Second guess: STANE → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
  – S is now confirmed in position 1.
  – A is confirmed in position 3.
  – N and T are not in the word.
  – E remains fixed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ E

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Letters already ruled out: R, I, T, N.  
Letters still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Position 4 must be a consonant (since all vowels except E have been checked or ruled out).  
A common consonant pair that fits is “L” and “M” or “C” and “L”.

Let’s test a word that fills positions 2 and 4 with common consonants while keeping the already confirmed S, A, E.

“SCALE” fits the current pattern:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- C in position 2 (new test).
- A in position 3 (confirmed).
- L in position 4 (new test).
- E in position 5 (confirmed).

This will check C and L while satisfying the current constraints.
