Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word's letters or positions. My strategy should maximize information gain by testing common letters and vowel/consonant patterns. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives excellent coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:

- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

Since we know the word starts with A and cannot contain R, O, S, or E, we want next to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common consonants include T, N, L, D, P, C, B, M, G. The remaining vowels are I and U (since O and E are out). A good next guess should:

1. Keep A in the first spot.
2. Use fresh letters that are still possible.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Testing a word like “ADMIT” keeps A in place, uses new consonants (D, M, T) and both remaining vowels (I). This will quickly reveal if any of D, M, I, T are present and where they fit.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

My strategy should maximize information gain by testing common letters and vowel/consonant patterns. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives excellent coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:

- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

Since we know the word starts with A and cannot contain R, O, S, or E, we want next to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common consonants include T, N, L, D, P, C, B, M, G. The remaining vowels are I and U (since O and E are out). A good next guess should:

1. Keep A in the first spot.
2. Use fresh letters that are still possible.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Testing a word like “ADMIT” keeps A in place, uses new consonants (D, M, T) and both remaining vowels (I). This will quickly reveal if any of D, M, I, T are present and where they fit.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

2. From both guesses we have eliminated these letters entirely:  
   R, O, S, E (from guess 1) and D, M, I, T (from guess 2).

Remaining common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested:  
   B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, W, Y

We still need at least one vowel; the only remaining vowel we haven’t tried is U.  
Let’s pick a word that keeps A fixed in first place, uses U, and fills the next four slots with fresh, still-possible common consonants.

A simple, well-balanced choice is “AUNCH”:
- A stays at position 1.
- U is our new vowel.
- N, C, H are high-frequency consonants we haven’t tested.

3. Letter that is in the word but not in position 2: U (because it shows “-”, meaning it exists but is misplaced).

Thus the word must be of the form:
A _ _ _ _
and it contains the letter U somewhere in positions 3-5 (since it can’t be in position 2).

Remaining untested common letters: B, F, G, K, L, P, W, Y (and U, which we now know is present).

To maximize information, we want to test as many fresh common consonants as possible while placing U in a new spot (position 3, 4, or 5).

A balanced choice is “ABULY”:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Places U in position 3 (a new spot).
- Tests fresh consonants B, L, Y (none have been tried yet).
- Uses tried-and-true strategy of mixing consonants and the confirmed vowel U.

This will help us determine if any of B, L, Y are in the word and where U belongs.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Pattern (positions 1 – 5):
1: A (✓ – locked)
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

Letters eliminated completely (x in any position):
R, O, S, E
D, M, I, T
N, C, H
B, Y

Letters still in play but whose exact positions are unknown:
U  (present somewhere, but not in position 2 or 3)
L  (present somewhere, but not in position 4)

Remaining untested common letters:
F, G, K, P, W

Thus the word looks like:
A _ _ _ _
with U somewhere in 3, 4 or 5 and L somewhere in 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 1 is A, so 2, 3, 5).

We need a guess that tests as many unused letters as possible while respecting these constraints.  
A good candidate is “AUGLY”:
- A fixed.
- U in position 2 (already ruled out for U, so this helps confirm U’s real spot).
- G, L, Y are used – but Y is already eliminated, so that letter is wasted.  
Let’s avoid Y and use fresh letters.

Better choice: “AFLUG”
- Uses F, G (fresh) and keeps U/L in play.
- Places U in position 4 (new for U) and L in position 5 (new for L).

But we must make sure all letters are still allowed.  Eliminated letters are listed above; F, L, U, G are still allowed.

Actually, let’s place U in position 5 (never tested) and L in position 3 (never tested) while adding fresh consonants F and G in other spots.

Final balanced choice: “AFGLU”
- Letters: A (fixed), F, G, L, U
- U in position 5 (new)
- L in position 4 (new)
- F and G in positions 2 and 3 (fresh)

However, all letters must form a valid 5-letter English word.  “AFGLU” isn’t a word.  

A valid word that fits is “AFLUG” (a real but obscure term), but let’s pick a more common valid word: “AMPUL” – but P hasn’t been eliminated?  Actually, P is still untested, but L and U are confirmed present and we need to place them correctly.

Valid common word respecting constraints: “APUL_” – no. Let’s list possibilities.

We know the letters are A, L, U plus two more from {F, G, K, P, W}.  
Possible valid English words starting with A, containing L and U, without any eliminated letters:  
“APFUL” – but F, P, U, L allowed.  Let’s test “APFUL”.

Wait – letters: A, P, F, U, L – all allowed, positions 1-5.  This places U in position 4 and L in 5.  That tests P and F as well.

This seems optimal.

From Guess 5 (APFUL) we received:

A(✓)  P(x)  F(✓)  U(✓)  L(✓)

So the secret word must be:

A  _  F  U  L

We already know the following letters are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, E, D, M, I, T, N, C, H, B, Y, P

All remaining letters are: A, F, L, U (✓ positions fixed) and anything else must be from the still-allowed consonants: G, K, W (since they haven’t appeared yet).

But the pattern is now fully determined as A _ F U L (positions 1-5).  
The only missing letter is the second character (position 2).  
We need a consonant that is still allowed and forms a valid English word.

Possible consonants left: G, K, W.

The only valid 5-letter English word fitting A _ F U L is:

A G F U L → no such word  
A K F U L → no such word  
A W F U L → “AWFUL” is a valid word.

So the only remaining possible word is AWFUL.
