For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word.

A good starting word is ""RAISE"" because:
- It contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E)
- All letters are distinct (no duplicates)
- It's a common, valid English word
- These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words, so it should give good feedback about which letters are present in the secret word

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively)
- The letters R, I, S are not present
- We have 3 positions to fill: 1, 3, 4 (since A is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5)

Good remaining common letters we haven't tried yet: T, N, O, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, U, Y

Let's try a word that places A and E in different positions and uses other common letters. A good candidate is ""OCEAN"":
- O, C, N are new common letters
- A and E are placed in positions 3 and 5 (we know E isn't in position 5 from RAISE feedback, but we can try it here to confirm)
Wait, RAISE feedback showed E was wrong position (position 5), so E should not be in position 5 again.

Let's try ""TALON"":
- T, L, O, N are new
- A is in position 2 (but we know A is wrong in position 2 from RAISE)
Not good.

Let's try ""PANEL"":
- P, N, L are new

- C, H, P are new
- A is in position 4 (new position)

This seems good - A and E are in different positions from RAISE, and we introduce 3 new common letters.

Actually, even better: ""PEACH""
