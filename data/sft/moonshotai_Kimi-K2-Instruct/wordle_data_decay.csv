This is my first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. In Wordle-like games, it's strategic to use a first word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starter word should use several of these.

Looking at 5-letter words that contain these letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This will help eliminate or confirm several letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A (-) – A is in the word but not in the first position.

3. O (x) – O is not in the word at all.
4. S (x) – S is not in the word at all.
5. E (-) – E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Take-aways:
- Eliminate R, O, S from any future guesses.
- The word contains A and E, but they are not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Need 5-letter words that contain both A and E, and the remaining letters must avoid R, O, S.

- Uses A in position 4 (was position 1, so new position).
- Introduces L, N, T – all common and not yet tested.

Possible candidate words that fit:
- CEDAR → C in 1, E 2, D 3, A 5 – but C(-) from BEACH, so C is in word but not 4, could be 1 or 3.
- MEDAL → M, E, D, A, L – but L already eliminated.

- PRIVA → nonsense.
- VENIA → I is allowed, N eliminated.
- CEDIA → C in 1, E 2, D 3, I 4, A 5 – C allowed in 1, D and I untested.

CEDAR fits all constraints:

In Wordle-like games, it's strategic to use a first word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starter word should use several of these.

Looking at 5-letter words that contain these letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This will help eliminate or confirm several letters efficiently.

Possible next candidates: words like LATER, LEANT, LEAVE, etc., but we must avoid R and S.
Let's pick a word that re-uses A and E in new positions and introduces new common letters (N, T, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “LEANT”:
- Uses E in position 2 (was position 5, so new position).
- Uses A in position 4 (was position 1, so new position).
- Introduces L, N, T – all common and not yet tested.
- Avoids R, O, S entirely.

So far we have:

1. Position 2 is definitely E.
2. Position 5 is definitely A.
   Current pattern: _ E _ _ A

3. Letters confirmed to be in the word but positions unknown:
   - D (from MEDIA: D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3)

4. Letters ruled out entirely:
   R, O, S, L, N, T, B, H, M, I

5. Available letters (not yet eliminated) include: C, F, G, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus A and E which are already placed.

6. We need:
   - A 5-letter word matching _ E _ _ A
   - Must contain D somewhere after position 2 (since D is not in position 3)
   - Only use letters from the still-allowed list

Possible positions for D: 3 or 4.
But D cannot be in position 3 (from MEDIA feedback D(-) in position 3), so D must be in position 4.

Revised pattern: _ E _ D A

Now the word is _ E _ D A with only positions 1 and 3 to fill from remaining allowed letters.

Still allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: C, F, G, K, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common English words ending in E D A:

- C could be in position 1 or 3.
- Other letters could fit.

Possible candidates:
- CEDAR – but R is eliminated
- VEDDA – not standard
- FEDEX – not 5 letters ending in A
- YIELD – ends in D, but we need A at end
- CUPID – ends in D, not A
- FLEDA – L eliminated
- WELDA – L eliminated
- CUBED – ends in D, not A
- CAGED – ends in D, not A
- CAVED – ends in D, not A

Hmm, maybe we need to consider that D must be in position 4, so:

_ E _ D A

Common words:
- C E D A – but that's only 4 letters
- C E D A + letter at position 3... no standard word
- P E D A – no
- G E D A – no
- K E D A – no

Wait, let's think differently: must be _ E _ D A

Common 5-letter words:
- C E D A ? – doesn't exist
- P E D A ? – doesn't exist
- Actually, looking at _ E _ D A:

Possible words:
- C E D A + any 3rd letter... no standard word
- F E D A – too short
- C E D A – too short

Wait, let's list possible:

We need:
Position 1: C, F, G, K, P, U, V, W, Y
Position 3: same set, but different from position 1 unless word allows repeats

Possible combinations:
- C E K D A – but CEKDA isn't a word
- P E C D A – PECDA not a word
- C E F D A – CEFDA not a word

Actually, the correct approach is to find real 5-letter words fitting _ E _ D A with allowed letters.

The only common word that fits _ E _ D A is:

C E D A – but that's 4 letters. Adding a letter in position 3...

Actually, the word is CEDAR but R is eliminated.

Next possibility: V E D A – no

Wait, let's re-examine allowed letters.

From MEDIA feedback:
- M(x) – M eliminated
- E(✓) – position 2
- D(-) – D is in word but not position 3
- I(x) – I eliminated
- A(-) – A is in word but not position 5 – but this contradicts earlier!

Wait, in MEDIA feedback: A(-) means A is in word but not in position 5. But earlier we deduced A must be in position 5 from LEANT and BEACH feedback. This suggests an inconsistency in our deduction.

Let me re-examine:

From BEACH: A(-) – A is in word but not position 3 or 4 (since in BEACH it was position 3)
From MEDIA: A(-) – A is in word but not position 5

This means A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. That leaves only position 2 for A, but position 2 is E. This is impossible, indicating an error in our deduction.

Reconstructing:

From feedback:
- AROSE: A(-) – A is in word, not position 1
- LEANT: A(-) – A is in word, not position 3
- BEACH: A(-) – A is in word, not position 3 (same position as in LEANT)
- MEDIA: A(-) – A is in word, not position 5

Thus A must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but:
- position 2 is E
- position 4: not excluded yet
- position 5: excluded by MEDIA

So A must be in position 4.

Revised pattern: _ E _ A _

And D must be in the word (from MEDIA: D(-) in position 3, so D is in word but not position 3)

Possible positions for D: 1, 4, or 5
But:
- position 4 is A
- position 5 is unknown
So D could be in 1 or 5

Also, we have C(-) from BEACH, meaning C is in word but not position 4 (which is A anyway)

So word must contain both C and D.

Possible positions:
- _ E _ A _ with C and D somewhere in remaining spots (1,3,5)

Possible words:
- C E D A ? – no
- D E C A ? – no
- C E _ A D – C E ? A D
  - C E B A D – B eliminated
  - C E F A D – not a word
  - C E G A D – not a word
  - C E K A D – not a word
  - C E P A D – not a word
- D E _ A C – D E ? A C
  - D E C A C – not standard
  - D E B A C – B eliminated
  - D E G A C – not standard
  - D E F A C – not standard

Actually, the only common 5-letter word with these constraints is:

D E C A Y – but Y is allowed, let's check:
- D E C A Y:
  - D is in position 1 – allowed (not position 3)
  - E in 2 ✓
  - C in 3 – allowed (not position 4)
  - A in 4 – allowed (not positions 1,3,5)
  - Y in 5 – allowed

This fits all constraints:
- Contains D and C in allowed positions
- E in 2
- A in 4
- No eliminated letters

5. E (-) – E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Take-aways:
- Eliminate R, O, S from any future guesses.
- The word contains A and E, but they are not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Need 5-letter words that contain both A and E, and the remaining letters must avoid R, O, S.

Possible next candidates: words like LATER, LEANT, LEAVE, etc., but we must avoid R and S.
Let's pick a word that re-uses A and E in new positions and introduces new common letters (N, T, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “LEANT”:
- Uses E in position 2 (was position 5, so new position).
- Uses A in position 4 (was position 1, so new position).
- Introduces L, N, T – all common and not yet tested.
- Avoids R, O, S entirely.

4. So far the pattern is: _ E _ _ _ with A somewhere after position 2.
5. Unused common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 2.
- A somewhere in positions 3–5.
- No R, O, S, L, N, T.
- Only remaining yet-untested letters.

Possible candidates:
- BEACH – position 2=E, A=3, but C and H are new.
- CREAM – A must be after pos 2, but this has A in 4 (already ruled out).
- BEACH fits: B, E, A, C, H – none of the banned letters and A is now in position 3.

1. Letter set so far:
   - E is fixed in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4.
   - Therefore A must be in position 5.

2. Eliminated letters: R, O, S, L, N, T, B, H (and still R, O, S from first guess).

3. The pattern so far:
   _ E _ _ A

4. Still-unused common letters: C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   From Guess 3 we learned C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Possible candidate words that fit:
- CEDAR → C in 1, E 2, D 3, A 5 – but C(-) from BEACH, so C is in word but not 4, could be 1 or 3.
- MEDAL → M, E, D, A, L – but L already eliminated.
- VENUE → ends with E, not A.
- FLEA → too short.
- GAMER → R eliminated.
- PRIVA → nonsense.
- VENIA → I is allowed, N eliminated.
- CEDIA → C in 1, E 2, D 3, I 4, A 5 – C allowed in 1, D and I untested.

CEDAR fits all constraints:
- C is in word but not 4 (allowed in 1).
- E in 2 ✓
- D new
- A in 5 ✓
- R eliminated – but wait, CEDAR has R! So discard.

Next candidate: MEDIA
- M, E, D, I, A – none of B, R, O, S, L, N, T, H.
- E in 2, A in 5.
- C was (-) so C is in word but not 4 – MEDIA doesn’t include C, so this is fine.

Check MEDIA:
- M? new – ok
- E in 2 ✓
- D? new – ok
- I? new – ok
- A in 5 ✓

We now have the following constraints:

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 2 = E.

2. A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (A was “-” in every guess it appeared).  
   That is impossible for a 5-letter word – A must be in position 2, but position 2 is already E.  
   Therefore the initial interpretation of “-” must have been wrong.

Re-reading carefully:
- “-” means the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position, not necessarily “not in that exact position”.  
  So the only thing we can say about A is that it is **not** in the positions where we saw “-” for it:
  – not in 1 (from AROSE),  
  – not in 3 (from BEACH),  
  – not in 4 (from MEDIA).  

Hence A must be in position 5.

3. C was “-” in BEACH, so C is in the word but **not** in position 4.

4. D was “-” in MEDIA, so D is in the word but **not** in position 3.

5. Letters definitively out (from any “x”):  
   R, O, S, L, N, T, B, H, M, I.

6. So far the pattern must be:
   _ E _ _ A

7. Available unused letters (that have never been marked x or -):  
   C (not 4), D (not 3), F, G, J, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus any of the “-” letters placed in allowed spots.

8. We need three more letters, none of which are banned, satisfying:
   - C is somewhere except position 4  
   - D is somewhere except position 3

A quick check of the remaining unused common consonants:
   C can be 1 or 3 (forbidden 4).  
   D can be 1, 2, 4, 5 – but 2 is E, 5 is A, so D can be 1 or 4.  
   We still need one more consonant.

A word that satisfies everything:
C in 1, D in 4, plus a legal third consonant in 3: Y is still available.

Word: C E D Y A → not valid (must be real word).

Try C E Y D A → not valid.

Try C E P A … but A must be last.

Try C E P D A – no.

CEPEA – P E P E A – has two E’s (position 2 ok, but second E in 4 is allowed only if word has two E’s, but we do not know that).  
CEPEA is obscure but valid; however it has P in 3 and E in 4, which conflicts with nothing.

So letter 3 must be from {F,G,K,P,V,W,Y}  
letter 4 must be from {C,D,F,G,K,P,V,W,Y} (but C already used once – letters can repeat only if allowed; we have no info).

DECAY is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
D in 1 – never tested, ok.  
E in 2 – required, ok.  
C in 3 – C(-) from BEACH forbids C in 4, so 3 is ok.  
A in 5 – ok (A must be in 5).
