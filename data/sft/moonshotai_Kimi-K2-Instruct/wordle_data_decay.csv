For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E are present, plus the consonants R and S)
- Very common letters
- Good positional coverage (R and S are common in 4th and 5th positions)

This should give us good feedback on vowel placements and common consonants.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,decay,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E are present, plus the consonants R and S)
- Very common letters
- Good positional coverage (R and S are common in 4th and 5th positions)

This should give us good feedback on vowel placements and common consonants.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for arose tells us:
- A appears in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word at all  
- O is not in the word at all  
- S is not in the word at all  
- E appears in the word but not in position 5  

So we know the secret word:
- Contains the letters A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S
- Still needs three more unique letters (since we’ve only placed A and E so far)

To maximize new information, I want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5)
2. Uses mostly unused common letters (e.g., T, L, N, I, D, G, etc.)
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely  

A good candidate is ""LATED"":
- L, T, D are frequent consonants
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so still allowed)
- Uses no R, O, or S
- Should test T and D as new consonants

<guess>lated</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: lated -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A exists but not in 1st position
   - R, O, S do not exist
   - E exists but not in 5th position

2. lated → L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
   - L, T, D do not exist
   - A exists but not in 2nd position
   - E exists but not in 4th position

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, T, D

Known required letters: A, E  
Known forbidden positions so far:  
- A ≠ 1st, 2nd  
- E ≠ 4th, 5th

We still need three more distinct letters (total five).  
Among the remaining frequent letters (and not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

To maximize info, choose a word that:
- keeps A and E but in new positions
- introduces three new, common letters  
- avoids all excluded letters

A decent candidate is “CHINA”:
- C, H, I, N are still allowed letters  
- places A in 5th (new for A)  
- places all other letters in fresh positions  
- does not use any of R,O,S,L,T,D

Let’s submit CHINA.

Positions examined so far for A  
- Position 1 (arose) → NO

- Position 5 (china) → NO  
Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.

Positions examined so far for E

But note that C was in position 1 in “china” and got “-” feedback, so C is in the word but **not** in position 1.

- A must be in 3 or 4  
- E must be in 1, 2, or 3  
- C must appear somewhere but not in 1

Word form: _ E A C _

Choose first letter: must be from allowed set, not yet used in word.  
Good choices among B, F, G, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s pick B.

From the latest feedback we now know:

- E is in the word AND is in position 2  
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (so A must be in position 4)  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so C must be in 1, 3, or 5)  
- Letters B and K are NOT in the word  

Summary so far:
- Positions: _ E _ A _  
- Required letters still to place: C, plus one more (since we need 5 distinct letters)  
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, T, D, H, I, N, B, K

Remaining common letters: F, G, M, P, U, W, Y

C must appear somewhere.  Possible placements:

1) C in position 1 → C E _ A _ → need one more letter for position 3  
2) C in position 3 → _ E C A _ → need one more letter for position 1  
3) C in position 5 → _ E _ A C → need one more letter for position 3

Let’s test the first option: C E _ A _  and choose a valid letter for position 3 from the remaining set.

Pick F → C E F A _ , but we still need a final letter for position 5; but we only have four letters so far.  
We need to slot one more distinct letter.  

Actually, we only need four distinct letters so far: C, E, A, and one more.  
We already have E and A placed, and we need to place C and one additional letter.

Let’s list the possible valid words:

- C E F A ? – but we need a fifth letter; actually the word must be 5 letters.

Wait, the structure is _ E _ A _ with C and one more letter to place.

So possible words:

- C E ? A ? – no, that has C in position 1 and we need to fill 3 and 5.

Actually, the positions are:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: ? E ? A ?  

Letters to place: C and one more.

Possible combinations:

1) C E ? A ? → C must be in 1, need a letter for 3 and 5.  But we only need one more (since C, E, A, and one more).  Actually we need five total letters, so far we have E, A, C, and we need two more distinct letters, but we have only one slot left in the word.  This is getting confusing.

Let me re-summarize:

We have 5 positions to fill.  We know:
- E is in position 2  
- A is in position 4  
- C is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 3, or 5)  
- So far we have placed E and A.  We still need to place C and two more distinct letters.

But the word must be 5 letters total, so the remaining letters to be placed are C and two others (from F, G, M, P, U, W, Y).

Let’s try placing C in position 5.  Then the word is ? E ? A C.  
We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, from the allowed remaining set.

Possible letters: F, G, M, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s pick F and G:

F E G A C – valid letters, no exclusions.

Check constraints:
- E in 2 ✓  
- A in 4 ✓  
- C in 5 (allowed)  
- Letters F and G are allowed  
- No excluded letters

This seems valid.

(Alternatively, C in position 1: C E ? A ? – then we need two letters for 3 and 5.  For example C E G A M, but then we have to check if all letters are allowed.  C E G A M is also valid.)

Let’s go with FEGAC for now.

<guess>fegac</guess>",fegac,"From the latest feedback we now know:

- E is in the word AND is in position 2  
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (so A must be in position 4)  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so C must be in 1, 3, or 5)  
- Letters B and K are NOT in the word  

Summary so far:
- Positions: _ E _ A _  
- Required letters still to place: C, plus one more (since we need 5 distinct letters)  
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, T, D, H, I, N, B, K

Remaining common letters: F, G, M, P, U, W, Y

C must appear somewhere.  Possible placements:

1) C in position 1 → C E _ A _ → need one more letter for position 3  
2) C in position 3 → _ E C A _ → need one more letter for position 1  
3) C in position 5 → _ E _ A C → need one more letter for position 3

Let’s test the first option: C E _ A _  and choose a valid letter for position 3 from the remaining set.

Pick F → C E F A _ , but we still need a final letter for position 5; but we only have four letters so far.  
We need to slot one more distinct letter.  

Actually, we only need four distinct letters so far: C, E, A, and one more.  
We already have E and A placed, and we need to place C and one additional letter.

Let’s list the possible valid words:

- C E F A ? – but we need a fifth letter; actually the word must be 5 letters.

Wait, the structure is _ E _ A _ with C and one more letter to place.

So possible words:

- C E ? A ? – no, that has C in position 1 and we need to fill 3 and 5.

Actually, the positions are:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: ? E ? A ?  

Letters to place: C and one more.

Possible combinations:

1) C E ? A ? → C must be in 1, need a letter for 3 and 5.  But we only need one more (since C, E, A, and one more).  Actually we need five total letters, so far we have E, A, C, and we need two more distinct letters, but we have only one slot left in the word.  This is getting confusing.

But the word must be 5 letters total, so the remaining letters to be placed are C and two others (from F, G, M, P, U, W, Y).

Let’s try placing C in position 5.  Then the word is ? E ? A C.  
We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, from the allowed remaining set.

Possible letters: F, G, M, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s pick F and G:

F E G A C – valid letters, no exclusions.

Check constraints:
- E in 2 ✓  
- A in 4 ✓  
- C in 5 (allowed)  
- Letters F and G are allowed  
- No excluded letters

This seems valid.

(Alternatively, C in position 1: C E ? A ? – then we need two letters for 3 and 5.  For example C E G A M, but then we have to check if all letters are allowed.  C E G A M is also valid.)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,decay,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E are present, plus the consonants R and S)
- Very common letters
- Good positional coverage (R and S are common in 4th and 5th positions)

This should give us good feedback on vowel placements and common consonants.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for arose tells us:
- A appears in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word at all  
- O is not in the word at all  
- S is not in the word at all  
- E appears in the word but not in position 5  

So we know the secret word:
- Contains the letters A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S
- Still needs three more unique letters (since we’ve only placed A and E so far)

To maximize new information, I want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5)
2. Uses mostly unused common letters (e.g., T, L, N, I, D, G, etc.)
3. Avoids R, O, S entirely  

A good candidate is ""LATED"":
- L, T, D are frequent consonants
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so still allowed)
- Uses no R, O, or S
- Should test T and D as new consonants

<guess>lated</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: lated -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A exists but not in 1st position
   - R, O, S do not exist
   - E exists but not in 5th position

2. lated → L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)
   - L, T, D do not exist
   - A exists but not in 2nd position
   - E exists but not in 4th position

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, T, D

Known required letters: A, E  
Known forbidden positions so far:  
- A ≠ 1st, 2nd  
- E ≠ 4th, 5th

We still need three more distinct letters (total five).  
Among the remaining frequent letters (and not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

To maximize info, choose a word that:
- keeps A and E but in new positions
- introduces three new, common letters  
- avoids all excluded letters

A decent candidate is “CHINA”:
- C, H, I, N are still allowed letters  
- places A in 5th (new for A)  
- places all other letters in fresh positions  
- does not use any of R,O,S,L,T,D

Let’s submit CHINA.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints

Letters that are NOT in the word  
R, O, S, L, T, D, H, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word  
A (not in positions 1, 2, 5)  
E (not in positions 4, 5)

Positions examined so far for A  
- Position 1 (arose) → NO  
- Position 2 (lated) → NO  
- Position 5 (china) → NO  
Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.

Positions examined so far for E  
- Position 5 (arose) → NO  
- Position 4 (lated) → NO  
Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We still need three more distinct letters.  
Allowed unused common letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, W, Y (from the remaining alphabet).

But note that C was in position 1 in “china” and got “-” feedback, so C is in the word but **not** in position 1.

Let’s build a word that satisfies:
- A must be in 3 or 4  
- E must be in 1, 2, or 3  
- C must appear somewhere but not in 1  
- Two more distinct letters from the remaining list  
- No excluded letters

A straightforward combination:
E _ A _ _  with C elsewhere.

Try “PEACE”
Positions:
1 P  
2 E  
3 A  
4 C  
5 E (but E cannot be in 5) → invalid.

Try “BEACH”
But H is excluded.

Try “CACHE”
H excluded.

Try “EAGER”
R excluded.

Try “WEAVE”
W E A V E → E in 5 is invalid.

Try “PEACE” again: 5th letter E is invalid.

Try “PEAKY”
P E A K Y
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- Uses K and Y (new, allowed)  
- Does not use C yet. We know C must appear, so this word is incomplete.

We need to include C somewhere. Let’s force C into position 4, A into 3, E into 2.

Word form: _ E A C _

Choose first letter: must be from allowed set, not yet used in word.  
Good choices among B, F, G, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s pick B.  
Fifth letter: must be different, allowed. Choose K.

Word becomes: B E A C K

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, E, A, C, K – all allowed  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- C in 4 (not 1) – satisfies feedback  
- No excluded letters

Looks valid.

A ?  \n\nLetters to place: C and one more.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1) C E ? A ? → C must be in 1, need a letter for 3 and 5.  But we only need one more (since C, E, A, and one more).  Actually we need five total letters, so far we have E, A, C, and we need two more distinct letters, but we have only one slot left in the word.  This is getting confusing.\n\nLet me re-summarize:\n\nWe have 5 positions to fill.  We know:\n- E is in position 2  \n- A is in position 4  \n- C is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 3, or 5)  \n- So far we have placed E and A.  We still need to place C and two more distinct letters.\n\nBut the word must be 5 letters total, so the remaining letters to be placed are C and two others (from F, G, M, P, U, W, Y).\n\nLet’s try placing C in position 5.  Then the word is ? E ? A C.  \nWe need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, from the allowed remaining set.\n\nPossible letters: F, G, M, P, U, W, Y.\n\nLet’s pick F and G:\n\nF E G A C – valid letters, no exclusions.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- E in 2 ✓  \n- A in 4 ✓  \n- C in 5 (allowed)  \n- Letters F and G are allowed  \n- No excluded letters\n\nThis seems valid.\n\n(Alternatively, C in position 1: C E ? A ? – then we need two letters for 3 and 5.  For example C E G A M, but then we have to check if all letters are allowed.  C E G A M is also valid.)\n\nLet’s go with FEGAC for now.\n\n<guess>fegac</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: lated -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) D(-)\nGuess 3: china -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) I(x) N(x) A(-)\nGuess 4: beack -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) A(-) C(-) K(x)\nGuess 5: fegac -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) C(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s list what we now know for sure:

1. E is in position 2 (✓ from guess 5).  
2. A is in position 4 (✓ from guess 5).  
3. C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (guess 5 feedback).  
   Therefore C must be in position 1 or 3.  
4. Letters NOT in the word (so far):  
   R, O, S, L, T, D, H, I, N, B, K, F, G  

So the hidden word has the fixed pattern:  
_ E _ A _  
with C placed in either position 1 or 3, and one more letter needed in the remaining open slot.  
Allowed unused letters (from the remaining alphabet): M, P, U, W, Y (and C, which must appear).

Case 1 – C in position 1:  
C E _ A _ → we need to fill position 3 with one letter from {M, P, U, W, Y}.

Case 2 – C in position 3:  
_ E C A _ → we need to fill position 1 with one letter from {M, P, U, W, Y}.

Let’s pick Case 2 because it gives us an open slot at the start, which we can fill with any of the remaining letters.

Choose M for position 1:
M E C A _

Check all constraints:
- E in 2 ✓  
- A in 4 ✓  
- C in 3 (allowed)  
- M is unused and not excluded  
- No forbidden letters used  

So the only candidate remaining is “MECAY” (Y is still allowed and completes 5 distinct letters), but we already used C, E, A, M, and we need exactly 5 letters.  
Actually we just need one more letter for position 5.  The remaining unused and allowed letters are M, P, U, W, Y (excluding those already used or excluded).  We have already placed M.  So position 5 can be any of P, U, W, Y.

Let’s try “MECAP” (P is allowed).

Check:
- M (allowed), E (✓), C (allowed), A (✓), P (allowed).  
- No excluded letters.  
- C is in position 3, satisfying its placement constraints.  

Therefore the next guess is “MECAP”.
