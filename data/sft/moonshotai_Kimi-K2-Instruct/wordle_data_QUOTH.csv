For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes:
- Common vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words, so this guess should give us useful feedback about their presence and positions.

Step 1 – Analyze the feedback  
Guess 1: SLATE  
Feedback: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)

- T is fixed in the 4th position: _ _ _ T _  
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all, so we can ignore them.  
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, H, M, P, K, etc.).

Step 2 – Choose a second guess  
We want letters that haven’t been tried and that give broad coverage.  
A word that contains several fresh common letters plus keeps T in position 4 is ideal.

One such word is “RIGHT”:
- R, I, G, H haven’t been tested yet.  
- Keeps T in the 4th position (but the 5-letter “RIGHT” ends in T, so T would actually be in position 5 here; that doesn’t match the required _ _ _ T _ pattern).

Let’s instead pick “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I are all new.  
- T is in position 4, satisfying the feedback.

“FRUIT” seems like the best second guess under these constraints.

Step 1 – Summarize what we know  
- T must be in the 4th position: _ _ _ T _  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, I.

Step 2 – Identify remaining candidate letters  
Vowels left to test: O, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel)  
Consonants left to test: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Step 3 – Choose a word that satisfies every constraint  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.  
2. Contains U somewhere (but not in position 3).  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:  
U _ _ T _  (U first)  
_ U _ T _  (U second)  
_ _ U T _  (invalid, U would be 3rd)  
_ _ _ T U  (U fifth)

The most common pattern seems to be _ U _ T _.  
Looking through common words:  
- DUCTS – but C and S are already ruled out.  
- BUNTS – but N is fine; check letters: B, U, N, T, S → S already ruled out.  
- HUTCH – H, U, T, C, H → C not ruled out yet, but U is in position 2 and T in 4: H U _ T _ → HUTCH fits.  
Wait: “HUTCH” has U in position 2 and T in 4, which fits. Let’s double-check letters: H, U, T, C, H. We’ve never tested H or C, so it’s valid.

Another candidate: “GOUTY” – G, O, U, T, Y. T is 4th, U is 3rd (invalid).  
“MOUNT” – O, U, N, T. T is 4th; U is 3rd (invalid).  
“BOUTS” – B, O, U, T, S; T is 4th, U is 3rd (invalid).  
“PUNCH” – P, U, N, C, H; T missing.  

The only valid candidate I can quickly see is “HUTCH,” but it uses C and H which we haven’t tested.  
However, “HUTCH” has the pattern H U T C H, so T is actually in position 3, not 4. That’s a mistake.  

Let’s re-express the pattern: _ _ _ T _.  
We need to place U somewhere else:  
- U _ _ T _  
- _ U _ T _  
- _ _ U T _  (invalid)  
- _ _ _ T U  

Valid words fitting _ U _ T _ with all letters never tested:  
- DUCTY – but C is allowed, Y allowed, but D, U, C, T, Y. We’ve never tested D, C, Y.  
But is DUCTY a valid 5-letter English word? It’s obscure.  

Better: “MOUTH” – M, O, U, T, H. Pattern _ _ _ T _ → M O U T H. T is 4th. U is 3rd, which is ruled out.  

Another: “POUTY” – P, O, U, T, Y; T is 4th, U is 3rd, invalid.  

“JUMPY” – no T.  

“BUMPY” – no T.  

“COUNT” – C, O, U, N, T: T is 4th, U is 3rd, invalid.  

“DUNCT” – not a word.  

“GUMMY” – no T.  

“JUMPY” – no T.  

“LUSTY” – L already ruled out.  

“NUTTY” – N, U, T, T, Y; T is 4th, U is 2nd. This fits!  
Letters: N, U, T, T, Y.  
- T in 4th: yes.  
- U in 2nd: allowed (U just can’t be 3rd).  
- All letters N, U, T, Y are fresh.  

“NUTTY” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the best next guess is “NUTTY.”
</think>

The feedback tells us:
- T is locked in the 4th spot: _ _ _ T _  
- U is present somewhere, but not in position 3.  
- The letters S, L, A, E, F, R, I are all absent.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses only still-allowable letters is:

- F, R, U, I are all new.  
- T is in position 4, satisfying the feedback.

“FRUIT” seems like the best second guess under these constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) U(-) I(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Summarize what we know  
- T must be in the 4th position: _ _ _ T _  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, E, F, R, I.

Step 2 – Identify remaining candidate letters  
Vowels left to test: O, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel)  
Consonants left to test: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Step 3 – Choose a word that satisfies every constraint  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.  
2. Contains U somewhere (but not in position 3).  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:  
U _ _ T _  (U first)  
_ U _ T _  (U second)  
_ _ U T _  (invalid, U would be 3rd)  
_ _ _ T U  (U fifth)

The most common pattern seems to be _ U _ T _.  
Looking through common words:  
- DUCTS – but C and S are already ruled out.  
- BUNTS – but N is fine; check letters: B, U, N, T, S → S already ruled out.  
- HUTCH – H, U, T, C, H → C not ruled out yet, but U is in position 2 and T in 4: H U _ T _ → HUTCH fits.  
Wait: “HUTCH” has U in position 2 and T in 4, which fits. Let’s double-check letters: H, U, T, C, H. We’ve never tested H or C, so it’s valid.

Another candidate: “GOUTY” – G, O, U, T, Y. T is 4th, U is 3rd (invalid).  
“MOUNT” – O, U, N, T. T is 4th; U is 3rd (invalid).  
“BOUTS” – B, O, U, T, S; T is 4th, U is 3rd (invalid).  
“PUNCH” – P, U, N, C, H; T missing.  

The only valid candidate I can quickly see is “HUTCH,” but it uses C and H which we haven’t tested.  
However, “HUTCH” has the pattern H U T C H, so T is actually in position 3, not 4. That’s a mistake.  

Let’s re-express the pattern: _ _ _ T _.  
We need to place U somewhere else:  
- U _ _ T _  
- _ U _ T _  
- _ _ U T _  (invalid)  
- _ _ _ T U  

Valid words fitting _ U _ T _ with all letters never tested:  
- DUCTY – but C is allowed, Y allowed, but D, U, C, T, Y. We’ve never tested D, C, Y.  
But is DUCTY a valid 5-letter English word? It’s obscure.  

Better: “MOUTH” – M, O, U, T, H. Pattern _ _ _ T _ → M O U T H. T is 4th. U is 3rd, which is ruled out.  

Another: “POUTY” – P, O, U, T, Y; T is 4th, U is 3rd, invalid.  

“JUMPY” – no T.  

“BUMPY” – no T.  

“COUNT” – C, O, U, N, T: T is 4th, U is 3rd, invalid.  

“DUNCT” – not a word.  

“GUMMY” – no T.  

“JUMPY” – no T.  

“LUSTY” – L already ruled out.  

“NUTTY” – N, U, T, T, Y; T is 4th, U is 2nd. This fits!  
Letters: N, U, T, T, Y.  
- T in 4th: yes.  
- U in 2nd: allowed (U just can’t be 3rd).  
- All letters N, U, T, Y are fresh.  

“NUTTY” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the best next guess is “NUTTY.”The feedback tells us:
- T is locked in the 4th spot: _ _ _ T _  
- U is present somewhere, but not in position 3.  
- The letters S, L, A, E, F, R, I are all absent.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses only still-allowable letters is:

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Positions fixed:
- 4th letter is T.

Known letters:
- U is in the word and has been confirmed to be in position 2 (feedback U(✓)).
- T is in position 4 (feedback T(✓)).

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word at all:
S, L, A, E, F, R, I, N, Y.

Still-untested letters (and therefore candidates):
Vowels: O
Consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

So the word pattern is:
_ U _ T _

We now need a valid 5-letter English word matching that pattern and using only the allowable letters above.

Some quick scans:
- B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W are all fine to test.
- We need one more vowel (or allow Y) but Y is already ruled out, so the only available vowel is O.
- If we place O in position 3 we get _ U O T _.
- Looking for real words:
  – JUOT_ none.
  – MUOT_ none.
  – DUOT_ no standard word.
  – GUOT_ none.
  – BUOT_ none.
  – PUOT_ none.
  – HUOT_ none.
  – QUOT_ leads to “QUOTA” but ends in A (ruled out).
  – VUOT_ none.
  – WUOT_ none.

Hmm, O in position 3 seems to give no valid word.

Try O in position 5:
_ U _ T O
Possible words:
– B U _ T O → nothing common.
– C U _ T O → “CUTO” isn’t 5 letters.
– D U _ T O → “DUTO” no.
– G U _ T O → “GUTO” no.
– H U _ T O → “HUTO” no.
– J U _ T O → none.
– K U _ T O → none.
– M U _ T O → “MUTO” no.
– P U _ T O → “PUTO” no.
– V U _ T O → none.

Therefore O seems not to fit in this pattern either.

So the only remaining vowel (O) cannot be placed. That implies the word must use U as its sole vowel, and the remaining three unknown letters must all be consonants.

Pattern: C1 U C2 T C3, where C1, C2, C3 are from the still-allowed consonants.

A quick mental scan of common words with consonant clusters around U:
- JU_ T _ : “JUST” is only 4 letters.
- DU_ T _ : “DUTCH” fits _ U T C H but T is 3rd, not 4th.
- BU_ T _ : “BUTCH” same issue.
- MU_ T _ : “MUTCH” same.
- CU_ T _ : “CUTCH” same.
- PU_ T _ : “PUTTY” – but T is 4th and Y is ruled out.
- GU_ T _ : “GUTTY” ends in Y (ruled).
- BU_ T _ : “BUTTY” – Y ruled.
- CRU_ T _ : nothing.
- SCU_ T _ : nothing.

Wait, the pattern is _ U _ T _ so the 3rd letter is between U and T. That is rare in English; we usually don’t have three consonants in a row (U C T).

Actually, there is a very common word that fits: “DUCTY” or “DUCTS” but C is allowed and we have never tried C.  
However “DUCTS” ends in S which is ruled out.

Another valid word: “BUMPY” – doesn’t have T.

Actually, let’s check C and K:

Word: “JUKED” – doesn’t fit pattern.

“HUTCH” – T is 3rd, invalid.

“JUDGE” – no T.

“BUDGE” – no T.

“CUBIT” – ends in T, but T is 5th, not 4th.

“COMET” – ends T 5th.

“COMPT” – ends T 5th.

“DUVET” – ends T 5th.

“GUILT” – ends T 5th.

“PURGE” – no T.

“PURSE” – no T.

I realize I might need to use C and K.

Let me try “JUKED” – but ends in D.

Actually the only common word that fits _ U _ T _ and uses only untested consonants is “JUKED” (but D is allowed, however ends in D so pattern _ U _ T D, but we need T in 4th, so 5th is unknown).

Wait, let’s list every possible consonant triplets that fit:

_ U _ T _

Consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

For each first letter, what 5-letter words exist?

B: B U _ T _ → “BUTCH” – but T is 3rd.

C: C U _ T _ → “CULTS” – S ruled.

D: D U _ T _ → “DUCAT” – A ruled.

G: G U _ T _ → “GUTTY” – Y ruled.

H: H U _ T _ → “HUTCH” – T third.

J: J U _ T _ → “JUTES” – S ruled.

K: K U _ T _ → “KUTCH” – T third.

M: M U _ T _ → “MUTCH” – T third.

P: P U _ T _ → “PUTTY” – Y ruled.

Q: Q U _ T _ → “QUOTA” – A ruled.

V: V U _ T _ → “VUTCH” – not a word.

W: W U _ T _ → none.

X: X U _ T _ → none.

Z: Z U _ T _ → none.

This exhaustive scan shows that every candidate either (a) uses a ruled-out letter, (b) has T in wrong position, or (c) is not a valid English word.

But that seems impossible. I must have missed something.

Let me double-check: the pattern is _ U _ T _.

Actually there is one valid English word that fits: “QUOTH”.

Check letters:
Q – allowed  
U – allowed, and in position 2  
O – allowed  
T – allowed, and in position 4  
H – allowed  

No letter in “QUOTH” is ruled out.

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is “QUOTH”.

Final verification:
Pattern _ U _ T _ is Q U O T H → matches.  
All letters used are still allowed.  
It is a valid English word.

So, the next guess is “QUOTH”.

Positions fixed:
- 4th letter is T.

Still-untested letters (and therefore candidates):
Vowels: O

So the word pattern is:
_ U _ T _

I realize I might need to use C and K.

Let me try “JUKED” – but ends in D.

Actually the only common word that fits _ U _ T _ and uses only untested consonants is “JUKED” (but D is allowed, however ends in D so pattern _ U _ T D, but we need T in 4th, so 5th is unknown).

Wait, let’s list every possible consonant triplets that fit:

_ U _ T _

Consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
