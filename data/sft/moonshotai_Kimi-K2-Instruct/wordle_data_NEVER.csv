For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
- No repeating letters

Some popular starting words are: AROSE, AUDIO, ADIEU, CRANE, SLATE, or STARE. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter positioning (S and E are common ending letters)

Combined with the feedback from AROSE:
- Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, E, N  (and they each appear only once)
- Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, Y
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
  – N cannot be in position 2

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters R, E, N (and two other letters that are NOT A, O, S, T, Y)
- R must be in 1, 3, or 5
- E must be in 2, 3, or 4
- N must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- If R is in 1, we might have R _ _ _ _ → possible: R E N _ _  or R N E _ _
- If R is in 3, we might have _ E R _ _  or _ N R _ _  etc.
- If R is in 5, we might have _ _ _ _ R

Candidate words that fit:
- REN??  – but we need two more letters that are allowed (not A, O, S, T, Y)
- C and L are allowed: R E N C L (invalid, more than 5 letters)
- How about “REND _”? Not possible. Let’s look for ready five-letter words.

Good candidates:
- R E N _ _  → “RENCH” (invalid), “RENAL” (A not allowed), “RENEW” (W allowed but W not yet tested, and E allowed in pos 2) – but E cannot be in 5 and N cannot be in 2, so R E N E W is invalid (E repeats).
- Instead, try “INNER” (but N repeats, and I is allowed). However, N would be in position 4 which is allowed (- - - N -), E in 3 allowed, R in 5 allowed. So “INNER”:
  – Letters: I, N, N, E, R → two N’s, which would contradict “N appears once” if it’s a true Wordle word, so this is unlikely.
- “NERVE” – E in 2 allowed, R in 3 allowed, N in 1 allowed, V allowed, last E allowed (but we already have E in 2, so repeated E – but Wordle words can have repeats, yet our feedback only indicated one E so far). So “NERVE”:
  – Letters: N, E, R, V, E → V and E allowed, positions:
     N in 1 ✓ (allowed), E in 2 ✓ (allowed), R in 3 ✓ (allowed), V new, E in 5 ✗ (E not allowed in 5 by prior feedback).

Next candidate: “RENUM” – U and M allowed, but “RENUM” is not a recognized word.

Back to drawing board. Let’s list all possible positions for R, E, N:

R can be 1, 3, 5
E can be 2, 3, 4
N can be 1, 3, 4, 5

Try R in 1:
R _ _ _ _
Then E must be 2, 3, or 4
N must be 3,4,5 (but cannot conflict with E)

So:
R E _ _ _  → R E N _ _ (need two more letters, not A, O, S, T, Y)
Valid English word: “RENAL” (invalid A)
“RENEW” (invalid W not yet confirmed, E repeats)
“RENDZ” (invalid Z)
“RENIG” (invalid G allowed? G is allowed)
“RENIG” is valid but obscure.

R _ E _ _  → R _ E N _  or R _ _ E N  etc.
“RINSE” – S not allowed
“RIDGE” – D, G, I allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, D new, G new, E(5) ✗ (E not allowed in 5)

“RIPEN” – I, P allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, P new, E(3) ✓, N(4) ✓
Check constraints:
- Contains R, E, N ✓
- No A, O, S, T, Y ✓
- R is not in 2 or 4 ✓ (it’s in 1)
- E is not in 1 or 5 ✓ (it’s in 3)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
A(x) – A is NOT in the word
R(-) – R is present but NOT in position 2
O(x) – O is NOT in the word
S(x) – S is NOT in the word
E(-) – E is present but NOT in position 5

So the target word:
- Contains R and E
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in new positions. Good consonants remaining: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. We’ll try to include some of them.

Possible candidates: TREND, CRUEL, FERAL (but has A), PERIL, etc. “TREND” fits:
- Letters: T, R, E, N, D
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S)
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2; so this is invalid)
Oops, need to move R away from position 2. Try “ENTRY”:
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- No forbidden letters
- R is in position 4
- E is in position 1 (allowed since it was just excluded from position 5)

<guess>ENTRY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N(-) : N is in the word but not in position 2.
- T(x) : T is NOT in the word.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(x) : Y is NOT in the word.

Combined with the feedback from AROSE:
- Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, E, N  (and they each appear only once)
- Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, Y
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
  – N cannot be in position 2

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters R, E, N (and two other letters that are NOT A, O, S, T, Y)
- R must be in 1, 3, or 5
- E must be in 2, 3, or 4
- N must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- If R is in 1, we might have R _ _ _ _ → possible: R E N _ _  or R N E _ _
- If R is in 3, we might have _ E R _ _  or _ N R _ _  etc.
- If R is in 5, we might have _ _ _ _ R

Candidate words that fit:
- REN??  – but we need two more letters that are allowed (not A, O, S, T, Y)
- C and L are allowed: R E N C L (invalid, more than 5 letters)
- How about “REND _”? Not possible. Let’s look for ready five-letter words.

Good candidates:
- R E N _ _  → “RENCH” (invalid), “RENAL” (A not allowed), “RENEW” (W allowed but W not yet tested, and E allowed in pos 2) – but E cannot be in 5 and N cannot be in 2, so R E N E W is invalid (E repeats).
- Instead, try “INNER” (but N repeats, and I is allowed). However, N would be in position 4 which is allowed (- - - N -), E in 3 allowed, R in 5 allowed. So “INNER”:
  – Letters: I, N, N, E, R → two N’s, which would contradict “N appears once” if it’s a true Wordle word, so this is unlikely.
- “NERVE” – E in 2 allowed, R in 3 allowed, N in 1 allowed, V allowed, last E allowed (but we already have E in 2, so repeated E – but Wordle words can have repeats, yet our feedback only indicated one E so far). So “NERVE”:
  – Letters: N, E, R, V, E → V and E allowed, positions:
     N in 1 ✓ (allowed), E in 2 ✓ (allowed), R in 3 ✓ (allowed), V new, E in 5 ✗ (E not allowed in 5 by prior feedback).

Next candidate: “RENUM” – U and M allowed, but “RENUM” is not a recognized word.

Back to drawing board. Let’s list all possible positions for R, E, N:

R can be 1, 3, 5
E can be 2, 3, 4
N can be 1, 3, 4, 5

Try R in 1:
R _ _ _ _
Then E must be 2, 3, or 4
N must be 3,4,5 (but cannot conflict with E)

So:
R E _ _ _  → R E N _ _ (need two more letters, not A, O, S, T, Y)
Valid English word: “RENAL” (invalid A)
“RENEW” (invalid W not yet confirmed, E repeats)
“RENDZ” (invalid Z)
“RENIG” (invalid G allowed? G is allowed)
“RENIG” is valid but obscure.

R _ E _ _  → R _ E N _  or R _ _ E N  etc.
“RINSE” – S not allowed
“RIDGE” – D, G, I allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, D new, G new, E(5) ✗ (E not allowed in 5)

“RIPEN” – I, P allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, P new, E(3) ✓, N(4) ✓
Check constraints:
- Contains R, E, N ✓
- No A, O, S, T, Y ✓
- R is not in 2 or 4 ✓ (it’s in 1)
- E is not in 1 or 5 ✓ (it’s in 3)
- N is not in 2 ✓ (it’s in 4)

So “RIPEN” fits every rule.

Therefore, next guess: RIPEN.

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   – Letters confirmed present: R (not in pos 2), E (not in pos 5)

2. ENTRY → E(-) N(-) T(x) R(-) Y(x)

   – Letters confirmed present: N (not in pos 2), E (not in pos 1), R (not in pos 4)

3. RIPEN → R(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓) N(-)
   – Letters excluded: I, P
   – E is now locked in position 4
   – R is confirmed present but not in pos 1
   – N is confirmed present but not in pos 5

So, the target word:
- Must contain exactly the letters R, E, N (each once)
- Must have E in position 4
- R cannot be in 1, 2, or 4
- N cannot be in 2 or 5
- Cannot contain A, O, S, T, Y, I, P

Allowed positions for R: 3 or 5
Allowed positions for N: 1 or 3 or 4, but 4 is already E, so 1 or 3

We need two more distinct letters (not repeating R, E, N) chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z (note Q, J might be too rare).

Let’s list the only possible patterns using one R and one N in allowed positions, with E fixed at 4:

Case 1: R in 3
   Positions: _ _ R E _
   N must go in 1 (since 2 and 5 forbidden for N)

Case 2: R in 5
   Positions: _ _ _ E R
   N must go in 1 or 3
   – If N in 1: N _ _ E R
   – If N in 3: _ _ N E R

We now check which of these patterns yield real English words when filled with two allowed consonants.

Case 1: N _ R E _   (R3, E4, N1, _2 and _5 to fill)
   Need two letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Z

- E is in position 1 (allowed since it was just excluded from position 5)

<guess>ENTRY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N(-) : N is in the word but not in position 2.
- T(x) : T is NOT in the word.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(x) : Y is NOT in the word.

Combined with the feedback from AROSE:
- Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, E, N  (and they each appear only once)
- Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, Y
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5
  – N cannot be in position 2

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters R, E, N (and two other letters that are NOT A, O, S, T, Y)
- R must be in 1, 3, or 5
- E must be in 2, 3, or 4
- N must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of possibilities:
- If R is in 1, we might have R _ _ _ _ → possible: R E N _ _  or R N E _ _
- If R is in 3, we might have _ E R _ _  or _ N R _ _  etc.
- If R is in 5, we might have _ _ _ _ R

Candidate words that fit:
- REN??  – but we need two more letters that are allowed (not A, O, S, T, Y)
- C and L are allowed: R E N C L (invalid, more than 5 letters)
- How about “REND _”? Not possible. Let’s look for ready five-letter words.

Good candidates:
- R E N _ _  → “RENCH” (invalid), “RENAL” (A not allowed), “RENEW” (W allowed but W not yet tested, and E allowed in pos 2) – but E cannot be in 5 and N cannot be in 2, so R E N E W is invalid (E repeats).
- Instead, try “INNER” (but N repeats, and I is allowed). However, N would be in position 4 which is allowed (- - - N -), E in 3 allowed, R in 5 allowed. So “INNER”:
  – Letters: I, N, N, E, R → two N’s, which would contradict “N appears once” if it’s a true Wordle word, so this is unlikely.
- “NERVE” – E in 2 allowed, R in 3 allowed, N in 1 allowed, V allowed, last E allowed (but we already have E in 2, so repeated E – but Wordle words can have repeats, yet our feedback only indicated one E so far). So “NERVE”:
  – Letters: N, E, R, V, E → V and E allowed, positions:
     N in 1 ✓ (allowed), E in 2 ✓ (allowed), R in 3 ✓ (allowed), V new, E in 5 ✗ (E not allowed in 5 by prior feedback).

Next candidate: “RENUM” – U and M allowed, but “RENUM” is not a recognized word.

Back to drawing board. Let’s list all possible positions for R, E, N:

R can be 1, 3, 5
E can be 2, 3, 4
N can be 1, 3, 4, 5

Try R in 1:
R _ _ _ _
Then E must be 2, 3, or 4
N must be 3,4,5 (but cannot conflict with E)

So:
R E _ _ _  → R E N _ _ (need two more letters, not A, O, S, T, Y)
Valid English word: “RENAL” (invalid A)
“RENEW” (invalid W not yet confirmed, E repeats)
“RENDZ” (invalid Z)
“RENIG” (invalid G allowed? G is allowed)
“RENIG” is valid but obscure.

R _ E _ _  → R _ E N _  or R _ _ E N  etc.
“RINSE” – S not allowed
“RIDGE” – D, G, I allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, D new, G new, E(5) ✗ (E not allowed in 5)

“RIPEN” – I, P allowed; positions:
R(1) ✓, I new, P new, E(3) ✓, N(4) ✓
Check constraints:
- Contains R, E, N ✓
- No A, O, S, T, Y ✓
- R is not in 2 or 4 ✓ (it’s in 1)
- E is not in 1 or 5 ✓ (it’s in 3)
- N is not in 2 ✓ (it’s in 4)

So “RIPEN” fits every rule.

Therefore, next guess: RIPEN.

<guess>RIPEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: RIPEN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Letters excluded: A, O, S
   – Letters confirmed present: R (not in pos 2), E (not in pos 5)

2. ENTRY → E(-) N(-) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   – Letters excluded: T, Y
   – Letters confirmed present: N (not in pos 2), E (not in pos 1), R (not in pos 4)

3. RIPEN → R(-) I(x) P(x) E(✓) N(-)
   – Letters excluded: I, P
   – E is now locked in position 4
   – R is confirmed present but not in pos 1
   – N is confirmed present but not in pos 5

So, the target word:
- Must contain exactly the letters R, E, N (each once)
- Must have E in position 4
- R cannot be in 1, 2, or 4
- N cannot be in 2 or 5
- Cannot contain A, O, S, T, Y, I, P

Allowed positions for R: 3 or 5
Allowed positions for N: 1 or 3 or 4, but 4 is already E, so 1 or 3

We need two more distinct letters (not repeating R, E, N) chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z (note Q, J might be too rare).

Let’s list the only possible patterns using one R and one N in allowed positions, with E fixed at 4:

Case 1: R in 3
   Positions: _ _ R E _
   N must go in 1 (since 2 and 5 forbidden for N)
   Pattern: N _ R E _

Case 2: R in 5
   Positions: _ _ _ E R
   N must go in 1 or 3
   – If N in 1: N _ _ E R
   – If N in 3: _ _ N E R

We now check which of these patterns yield real English words when filled with two allowed consonants.

Case 1: N _ R E _   (R3, E4, N1, _2 and _5 to fill)
   Need two letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,V,W,X,Z
   Real words that fit:
   N D R E L  → “NDREL” – not valid
   N F R E D – not valid
   N G R E D – not valid
   N C R E W – “NCREW” – no
   N G R E W – “NGREW” – no
   N U R E D – “NURED” – no
   N U R E K – “NUREK” – no
   N D R E G – no
   N D R E W – “NDREW” – no
   N C R E D – no
   N L R E D – no
   Actually, “N D R E L” doesn’t exist. Closest: “N E R E D” (but repeats E and has extra E). No valid 5-letter word emerges.

Case 2a: N _ _ E R   (R5, E4, N1)
   Pattern: N _ _ E R
   Need two letters in 2 and 3 from allowed set.
   Real words:
   N U M E R – “NUMER” – not a word
   N E V E R – repeats E
   N A M E R – A excluded
   N O M E R – O excluded
   N E M E R – repeats E
   N U K E R – no
   N U D E R – “NUDER” – comparative adjective but not recognized Wordle word
   N E D E R – repeats E
   N E G E R – invalid
   N I D E R – I excluded
   N U C E R – no
   N U G E R – no
   N U L E R – no
   N U B E R – “NUBER” – no
   Seems no common word.

Case 2b: _ _ N E R   (R5, E4, N3)
   Pattern: _ _ N E R
   Need two letters in 1 and 2 from allowed set.
   Real words:
   B U N E R – “BUNER” – no
   C U N E R – “CUNER” – no
   D U N E R – “DUNER” – yes! (variant of “dune rider”)
   F U N E R – “FUNER” – no
   G U N E R – “GUNER” – no
   H U N E R – “HUNER” – no
   L U N E R – “LUNER” – no
   M U N E R – “MUNER” – no
   V U N E R – no
   D I N E R – I excluded
   D E N E R – repeats E
   D O N E R – O excluded
   D A N E R – A excluded
   D U N E R appears to be the only valid candidate from the remaining letters.

Hence the only valid 5-letter word fitting every constraint is “DUNER”.

None of the common English 5-letter words fit the pattern N _ _ E R with the allowed letters. This suggests we need to re-examine our previous deductions.

Wait, let’s double-check the pattern N _ _ E R with allowed consonants:

Position 2 and 3 must be filled with distinct letters from: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, X, Z

Possible combinations:

- N B L E R – not a word
- N B C E R – not a word
- N C L E R – not a word
- N F L E R – not a word
- N G L E R – not a word
- N K L E R – not a word
- N L M E R – not a word
- N V L E R – not a word
- N W L E R – not a word
- N X L E R – not a word
- N Z L E R – not a word

None of these form valid English words. This implies that our earlier assumption that N must be in position 1 is correct, but there is no valid word matching N _ _ E R with the allowed letters. This suggests either:

(a) We missed a word, or  
(b) Our previous deductions are incomplete.

Re-examining constraints:

- E is locked at 4, R at 5  
- N is confirmed present and must be in position 1 (only remaining allowed spot)  
- Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, X, Z  

The only possible valid word left is “N E W E R” but it repeats E and has U which is excluded.  

Actually, let’s try:

- N E V E R – repeats E
- N E C K E R – too long
- N E X E R – repeats E
- N E W E R – repeats E
- N E M E R – repeats E
- N E G E R – repeats E
- N E F E R – repeats E
- N E L E R – repeats E
- N E C E R – repeats E
- N E B E R – repeats E

All repeat E or use excluded letters. This suggests there is no valid English word matching N _ _ E R under these constraints. This implies we must have made an error earlier.

Wait, let’s re-express the constraints:

Positions:
1: must be N (only spot left for N)
2: ?
3: ?
4: E
5: R

We need two distinct consonants (not N, E, R and not forbidden) for positions 2 and 3.

Valid combinations:

- N B C E R – not a word
- N B G E R – not a word
- N C H E R – not a word
- N C K E R – not a word
- N C L E R – not a word
- N C M E R – not a word
- N C V E R – not a word
- N C W E R – not a word
- N C X E R – not a word
- N C Z E R – not a word
- N F L E R – not a word
- N F G E R – not a word
- N G L E R – not a word
- N H L E R – not a word
- N K L E R – not a word
- N L M E R – not a word
- N M V E R – not a word
- N V L E R – not a word
- N W L E R – not a word
- N X L E R – not a word
- N Z L E R – not a word

None of these produce valid English words. The only possible explanation is that the word is “N E V E R” despite the repeated E, but that would violate the single-E constraint implied by feedback. This suggests we must have missed a word.

Let me check a dictionary for 5-letter words ending in “_ E R” with N in position 1:

Valid words:
- N E V E R – but repeats E and has E in pos 2 (allowed), but we have E only once per feedback (original feedback said E in AROSE was “-” meaning E is present once, so single E is confirmed). So never won’t work.
- N E X E R – same issue
- N E C K E R – too long
- N U M E R – U excluded
- N I N E R – I excluded
- N U D E R – U and D excluded
- N A G E R – A excluded
- N A M E R – A excluded
- N O D E R – O excluded
- N O M E R – O excluded
- N O V E R – O excluded
- N U D G E R – too long
- N U G E R – not a word
- N U M E R – not a word
- N U R E R – repeats R
- N U S E R – S excluded
- N U T E R – T excluded
- N U V E R – not a word
- N U W E R – not a word
- N U X E R – not a word
- N U Y E R – Y excluded
- N U Z E R – not a word
- N A N E R – A excluded
- N E G E R – repeats E
- N E M E R – repeats E
- N E P E R – P excluded
- N E R E R – repeats E and R
- N E S E R – S excluded
- N E T E R – T excluded
- N E V E R – repeats E
- N E W E R – repeats E
- N E X E R – repeats E
- N E Y E R – Y excluded
- N E Z E R – repeats E

There are no valid 5-letter English words matching N _ _ E R under these constraints. This suggests our deduction that N must be in position 1 is correct, but there are no words left. Therefore, the word must be “N E V E R” despite the single-E issue, but that contradicts feedback. This implies we missed a word.

Wait, let’s try:

- N C H E R – “NCHER” – not a word
- N G H E R – “NGHER” – not a word
- N K H E R – not a word
- N G L E R – not a word
- N K L E R – not a word
- N L V E R – not a word
- N M L E R – not a word
- N V M E R – not a word
- N W M E R – not a word
- N X M E R – not a word
- N Z M E R – not a word

This exhaustive check shows no valid English word. The only possible word left is “N E V E R” but it violates the single-E constraint. This implies our earlier assumption that N must be in position 1 is correct, but no word exists. Therefore, the word must be “N E V E R” despite the apparent contradiction, indicating a possible error in our deductions.

Upon re-reading the feedback, the original ENTRY feedback had E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 1, not necessarily only once. Similarly, AROSE had E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 5. The feedback does not preclude multiple E’s; it only indicates positions ruled out for each occurrence. Therefore, the word could have two E’s.

Thus, the word “N E V E R” fits:
- E in position 2 (allowed) and position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- V is allowed

So the correct next guess is:

<guess>NEVER</guess>
</think>

Based on the latest feedback and re-evaluating the constraints, the only valid 5-letter word that fits all the confirmed letters and positions is ""NEVER"".

<guess>NEVER</guess>",NEVER,"From the new feedback on DUNER:
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3
- E(✓) – E is in the word and locked into position 4
- R(✓) – R is in the word and locked into position 5

So we now know:

Confirmed letters and positions:
4: E  
5: R  

Confirmed letters still needing placement:
N (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5; therefore N must be in position 1)

Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, T, Y, I, P, D, U  
Allowed remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, X, Z

Current pattern:
1: N  
2: ?  
3: ?  
4: E  
5: R  

We need two more distinct letters (not repeating N, E, R) for positions 2 and 3 chosen from the allowed set.

So the correct next guess is:
