For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Classic choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants

This guess will help us determine which of these common letters are in the secret word and their approximate positions.

- P, M are new letters  
- A appears again (allowed since the word can repeat letters)

- M, L, L (but L is repeated) — maybe better.

Another: SCALP  
- S ✓  
- C, L, P new letters  
- A in position 3 — but earlier we saw A was “-” in position 3 in SAINT, so A can’t be in 3.

Collecting everything we now know:

Letters in the word
- S is in position 1 (✓ at every occurrence).
- A is in the word and has landed in position 3 (✓) and earlier in 2 (-) and 4 (-).  
  From the history:
    – AROSE: A(-) means A was not in position 1.  
    – SAINT: A(-) means A was not in position 2.  
    – SCALY: A(✓) means A is in position 3.  
  So the pattern is now: S _ A _ _

Letters NOT in the word
- From AROSE: R, O, E are out.  
- From SAINT: I, N, T are out.  
- From SCALY: C, L, Y are out.

Remaining allowed consonants (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W  
Remaining vowels already used: A is placed, so only possibilities are U or maybe a repeated A (but let’s avoid repeats for now).

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5.  
Target template: S _ A _ _

Possible combinations:
- Second letter: any remaining consonant.  
- Fourth & fifth letters: must be from the remaining pool, no repeats of banned letters.

Common 5-letter words fitting S _ A _ _:
- SHAKE → uses S, H, A, K, E; but E is banned.  
- SHARD → R banned.  
- SHARK → R banned.  
- SPASM → repeats S three times, but S already fixed; P, M are new; S again doesn’t help.  
- SWAMP → M is new, W is new, P is new; but P is in position 4, A is 3, so word would be S W A M P → but A is fixed at 3 so this is S _ A M P. Wait, template is S _ A _ _ , so fourth letter is position 4, fifth is position 5.  
  SWAMP is S W A M P → A is at 3, which matches. All letters allowed so far.

Checks:
S ✓ (position 1)  
W (new)  
A ✓ (position 3)  
M (new)  
P (new)  

No banned letters, and all constraints met.  
Therefore SWAMP seems like the best next guess.
