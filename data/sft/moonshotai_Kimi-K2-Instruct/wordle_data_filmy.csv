For my first guess, I want a word that uses common letters to help quickly narrow down possibilities. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"" which cover frequently used letters. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all very common in English words, giving me good coverage for initial feedback.

From the feedback:
- **S** is not in the word at all (x).
- **L** is in the word but not at position 2 (–).
- **A, T, E** are all absent (x).

So the secret word:
- does not contain S, A, T, E.
- contains L somewhere other than 2nd position.

To maximize info with the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps L but moves it to a new spot,
- uses other common consonants not yet ruled out,
- tries the vowel “O” (since A and E are out).

A good candidate is “WORLD”:
- W, O, R, L, D — none of these letters were tried yet.
- Places L in the 4th spot to test a new location.
- Uses another common vowel (O) and common consonants (W, R, D).

Feedback summary so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, W, O, R, D.
- Letter L is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4.
- So L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Remaining “common” letters not yet tried: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- We still need at least one vowel. The only vowels we haven’t tested are I, U, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).

Strategy: build a word that places L in a new spot (1, 3, or 5) and incorporates fresh consonants plus a vowel. A concise way to do that is to use L in position 1, add a vowel, and two or three new consonants. “LUNCH” is invalid because we already ruled out U (not ruled out yet, actually). Let me pick a word with I since it’s a new vowel: “FLICK” uses F, L, I, C, K – none of which have been excluded except L (which we know is in the word). But F, I, C, K are all fresh. I’ll go with “FLICK”.

Current known facts:
1. Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, O, R, D, C, K.
2. Letters confirmed present: F, L, I.
   - F is in position 1.
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from WORLD and FLICK feedback).
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from FLICK feedback).

Thus:
- L must be at position 3 or 5.
- I must be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- The word starts with F, so the form is F _ _ _ _.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word starting with F, containing L and I, and using only the still-allowed letters (no S,A,T,E,W,O,R,D,C,K).

Still-allowed consonants: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
Still-allowed vowels: I, U, Y.

Possible patterns:
- F L I _ _  – but L must be at 3 or 5, so invalid.
- F _ L I _  – L at 3, I at 4.
- F _ _ L I  – L at 4 (invalid per feedback), I at 5.
- F I L _ _  – I at 2, L at 3.
- F I _ L _  – I at 2, L at 4 (invalid).

So only two valid placements:
1. F _ L I _  (L at 3, I at 4)
2. F I L _ _  (I at 2, L at 3)

Let’s check dictionaries for common words matching these patterns.

Pattern 1: F _ L I _
- FULIN? – no.
- FALIN? – no A.
- FILIN? – no.
- FULID? – no D.
- Actually, the only common word fitting is “FILMY” (but Y is allowed). But does it have L in position 3 and I in position 4? No, in FILMY, L is position 2, I is 3 – invalid.

Wait, let's list possible letters for pattern F _ L I _:
Positions: 1=F, 3=L, 4=I.
Letters for position 2 and 5 must be from remaining allowed.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, I, U, Y (but I is already at 4).

So possible:
F B L I N – FBLIN – not a word.
F G L I N – not a word.
F H L I N – not a word.
F M L I N – not a word.
F N L I N – not a word.
F P L I N – not a word.
F Q L I N – not a word.
F V L I N – not a word.
F X L I N – not a word.
F Y L I N – not a word.
F Z L I N – not a word.

Hmm, none working for F _ L I _.

Pattern 2: F I L _ _
Positions: 1=F, 2=I, 3=L.
Letters for 4 and 5 must be from allowed: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, U, Y.

Possible endings:
- F I L M Y – FILMY – but L is position 3 (allowed), I is position 2 (allowed).
- F I L M Y: letters F, I, L, M, Y – all allowed (M, Y not previously excluded).
- FILMY is a valid English word.

Let’s check if any other common words fit:
- F I L L Y – has two L’s – but L is allowed to appear multiple times? The game rules don’t forbid it, but the feedback only confirmed one L so far. We could have two L’s, but guessing a double letter early is risky.
- F I L U M – FILUM – archaic term for film, but less common.
- FILMY seems the best.

So, the most reasonable next guess is FILMY.

But let’s double-check constraints:
- Starts with F (confirmed ✓ at position 1).
- Contains L and I (confirmed).
- L is at position 3 (allowed, since previous feedback said L not at 2 or 4 – position 3 is fine).
- I is at position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback said I not at 3 – position 2 is fine).
- Letters M and Y have not been previously ruled out.

Thus, FILMY is a valid and informative next guess.

<guess>FILMY</guess>",FILMY,"Current known facts:
1. Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, O, R, D, C, K.
2. Letters confirmed present: F, L, I.
   - F is in position 1.
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from WORLD and FLICK feedback).
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from FLICK feedback).

Thus:
- L must be at position 3 or 5.
- I must be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- The word starts with F, so the form is F _ _ _ _.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word starting with F, containing L and I, and using only the still-allowed letters (no S,A,T,E,W,O,R,D,C,K).

Still-allowed consonants: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
Still-allowed vowels: I, U, Y.

Possible patterns:
- F L I _ _  – but L must be at 3 or 5, so invalid.
- F _ L I _  – L at 3, I at 4.
- F _ _ L I  – L at 4 (invalid per feedback), I at 5.
- F I L _ _  – I at 2, L at 3.
- F I _ L _  – I at 2, L at 4 (invalid).

So only two valid placements:
1. F _ L I _  (L at 3, I at 4)
2. F I L _ _  (I at 2, L at 3)

Let’s check dictionaries for common words matching these patterns.

Pattern 1: F _ L I _
- FULIN? – no.
- FALIN? – no A.
- FILIN? – no.
- FULID? – no D.
- Actually, the only common word fitting is “FILMY” (but Y is allowed). But does it have L in position 3 and I in position 4? No, in FILMY, L is position 2, I is 3 – invalid.

Wait, let's list possible letters for pattern F _ L I _:
Positions: 1=F, 3=L, 4=I.
Letters for position 2 and 5 must be from remaining allowed.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, I, U, Y (but I is already at 4).

So possible:
F B L I N – FBLIN – not a word.
F G L I N – not a word.
F H L I N – not a word.
F M L I N – not a word.
F N L I N – not a word.
F P L I N – not a word.
F Q L I N – not a word.
F V L I N – not a word.
F X L I N – not a word.
F Y L I N – not a word.
F Z L I N – not a word.

Hmm, none working for F _ L I _.

Pattern 2: F I L _ _
Positions: 1=F, 2=I, 3=L.
Letters for 4 and 5 must be from allowed: B, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, U, Y.

Possible endings:
- F I L M Y – FILMY – but L is position 3 (allowed), I is position 2 (allowed).
- F I L M Y: letters F, I, L, M, Y – all allowed (M, Y not previously excluded).
- FILMY is a valid English word.

Let’s check if any other common words fit:
- F I L L Y – has two L’s – but L is allowed to appear multiple times? The game rules don’t forbid it, but the feedback only confirmed one L so far. We could have two L’s, but guessing a double letter early is risky.
- F I L U M – FILUM – archaic term for film, but less common.
- FILMY seems the best.

So, the most reasonable next guess is FILMY.

But let’s double-check constraints:
- Starts with F (confirmed ✓ at position 1).
- Contains L and I (confirmed).
- L is at position 3 (allowed, since previous feedback said L not at 2 or 4 – position 3 is fine).
- I is at position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback said I not at 3 – position 2 is fine).
- Letters M and Y have not been previously ruled out.

Thus, FILMY is a valid and informative next guess.",Guess 4: FILMY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
