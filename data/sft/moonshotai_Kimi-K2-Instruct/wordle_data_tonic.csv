For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to gather as much information as possible. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z. 

A good strategy is to choose a word with 5 unique, common letters that can reveal many possibilities. Among the most popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. These use very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very high-frequency letters. This should give me good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far the word contains O, and we know it cannot be in position 3. We also know to avoid A, R, S, E.

We need a new set of common consonants and vowels that haven’t been used. Good remaining common letters are T, I, N, L, C, U, M, D, B, G, H, P, Y. The vowels left are I, U, Y (sometimes).

I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses O in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 4, 5).
- Introduces new common consonants T, N, I, L, etc.

“POINT” comes to mind: P, O, I, N, T – none of these were in AROSE except O, and it places O in position 2 (allowed).

Now we have two clues:
1. O is in the correct position (position 2).
2. I, N, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.
3. P is not in the word.

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

We know:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- I, N, T must appear somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- We’ve already ruled out A, R, S, E, P.

Remaining common letters to consider: D, L, C, U, M, B, G, H, K, Y, W, F, V, etc.

Since we have I, N, T to place, let’s try a word that:
- Keeps O in position 2.
- Uses I, N, T in new positions (not 3,4,5 respectively).
- Introduces other common letters we haven’t tested yet.

A good candidate is “DONUT”:
- D and U are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- N moves to position 3 (was position 4, so allowed).
- U is new.
- T moves to position 5 (was position 5 in POINT, but feedback says T is in wrong position, so cannot be 5 here – hence this violates the rules).

Oops, that fails because T was in position 5 in POINT and feedback says T is wrong there, so T cannot be in position 5 again. Let me rethink.

Alternative: “TONIC”
- T moves to position 1 (allowed, was position 5).
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- N moves to position 3 (was position 4).
- I moves to position 4 (was position 3).
- C is new.

This fits all constraints:
- O is locked in position 2.
- I, N, T are in new positions.
- No banned letters (A, R, S, E, P).
