For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good starting word should use these letters. Some popular choices include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback:

- S, T, A are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains R somewhere except position 4.
3. It does NOT contain S, T, or A.

Good letters to test next: common consonants plus vowels not yet ruled out.  
Frequent 5-letter endings in English with E:  
- ...RE, ...LE, ...NE, ...ME, ...PE, ...GE, ...CE, ...VE, ...KE, ...DE, ...FE, ...SE (but S is out), ...HE (H still possible), etc.

Because R must appear not in 4th place, good candidate patterns include:
- R _ _ _ E (but then R is in correct position 1, which is allowed)
- _ R _ _ E
- _ _ R _ E
- _ _ _ R E  (but R can’t be in 4th place, so this is impossible)

So possible placements: positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s choose a word that places R in position 2 and introduces new useful consonants and vowels (O, I, L, N, M, C, etc.). A balanced choice is “MORNE” (though not super common, it tests M, O, R, N, E). A better common choice is “CRONE” but C and O are okay here.

However “CRONE” uses C and O, keeps R in 2nd place, and N in 4th.

Checking validity: CRONE is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore:

- E is fixed in 5th place.
- R is placed in 2nd place (feedback will confirm if this is correct spot).
- Adds C, O, N which are common letters we haven’t tested yet.

That seems optimal.

2. CRONE → C(✓) R(✓) O(x) N(x) E(✓)

Therefore, the word so far looks like:

Letters used/eliminated:
- Used: C, R, E
- Eliminated: S, T, A, O, N

Missing letters (positions 3 & 4):
We need two more letters, not yet used, that fit common patterns. Valid remaining consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. We want common ones.

Likely candidates for position 3: vowels (I, U) or common consonants (D, L, M, P, etc.)

Good possibilities:
CRIME, CRUDE, CRIME, CRUPE, CRIBE, CRULE, etc.

Let's pick one that tests two new common letters: ""CRIME"" tests I and M.

CRIME:
