This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z
4. Be a valid 5-letter word

Common starting words that people use include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words due to its use of very common letters and good vowel coverage.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z
4. Be a valid 5-letter word

Common starting words that people use include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words due to its use of very common letters and good vowel coverage.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are all **not** in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the **correct final position** (✓).

So we know:
- Word ends with N.
- Letters C, R, A, E are not used at all.
- We still need to determine the first four letters.

Good next steps:
1. Pick letters that are common but weren’t tested yet (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D).
2. Avoid C, R, A, E.
3. Keep N in the last position.

Possible candidates:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but E is excluded.
- SLUNG (S, L, U, N, G) – G not yet tested.
- STINT (S, T, I, N, T) – repeats T, and T is common.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – tests S, O, U, D.

""SOUND"" seems good because:
- It tests S, O, U, D – all new letters.
- Keeps N in position 5.
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- Known letters and positions: N at position 5, O at position 2.
- Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
- Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4.

Good letters still available (common, not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

We need:
- First letter: any new consonant.
- Third letter: any new consonant or vowel (but O already used, and A, E, U excluded → possible I).
- Fourth letter: same.

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ N with letters from remaining good set.

Candidates:
- FOILN – but FOILN isn’t a word.
- POINT – but I is untested, P/T are good, but T is very common.
- GOING – but G and I are untested, N is already known for last position.
- MONEY – uses M, N, E, Y – but E is excluded.
- HINGE – E excluded.
- BINGO – but B and I are untested, G too, but O is already in position 2.
- TONIC – but C is excluded.

Wait, we must avoid letters already excluded: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
O and N are correctly placed.

Consider ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (correct), I (new), N (correct), T (new).
- But N must be at position 5, so POINT would be P O I N T → but N is position 4 here, which conflicts.
Oops, that’s wrong because N must be at 5th.

So pattern is _ O _ _ N.

Best candidate: ""WOMIN"" – but WOMIN isn’t a valid word.
""LOGIN"" – L, O, G, I, N – valid word, uses new letters L, G, I.
""LOGIN"" fits _ O _ _ N: L O G I N.

Check letters:
- L: new, allowed
- O: correct, position 2
- G: new, allowed
- I: new, allowed
- N: correct, position 5

No conflicts with excluded letters.

Thus, ""LOGIN"" is a good next guess.

From the new feedback:

1. Positions locked:
   - 2: O (✓)
   - 5: N (✓)

2. Letter statuses:
   - Eliminated: C, R, A, E, S, U, D, L, G, X
   - Must appear, but we still don’t know where: I and T
   - Both I and T received “-”, meaning:
        – I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from LOGIN and TOXIN feedback)
        – T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from TOXIN feedback)
   - Therefore:
        – I must be in position 1 or 4
        – T must be in position 2, 3, or 4
   - But position 2 is already O, so T can only be 3 or 4
   - Position 1 can be I or T, but T cannot be at 1 anyway

3. Pattern we must fill:
   _ O _ _ N

   Possible placements of I and T:
   Option A: I is in position 1 → I O _ _ N
        – Remaining letter in 4 must be T → I O _ T N
        – The blank in 3 must be from remaining allowed consonants: B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y
        – Valid English word: I O (consonant) T N
        – Scanning, “IOBTN”, “IOFTN”, etc. → none are valid.
        – “IONIC” – but N at 5 not satisfied.
        – No valid 5-letter word matches I O ? T N.

   Option B: I is in position 4 → _ O I _ N
        – Then T must be in position 3 → _ O I T N
        – Position 1: any remaining allowed consonant B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y
        – We need a word shaped ? O I T N
        – Check dictionary: “POINT” (P O I N T) – but N must be 5, so “POINT” has N at 4, invalid.
        – “FOITN” – invalid.
        – “MOITN” – invalid.
        – The actual valid word that fits _ O I T N is “HOIST” – but ends with T, not N.
        – The only dictionary entry ending “OITN” is “POINT”, which is invalid because N must be 5.
        – “VOITN” – invalid.
        – “BOITN” – invalid.

   Option C: I is in position 4 and T in position 3 → same as above, no valid word.

   Option D: I is in position 1 and T in position 4 → same as Option A, no valid word.

   Hold on—let’s re-check the dictionary quickly for any hidden word matching ? O ? T N or ? O I T N.

   Real pattern: _ O _ _ N
   We now know the two missing letters are I and T, and each must occupy one of the blanks.

   Possible letter orderings inside _ O _ _ N:
   1. I O T _ N  – but that would have I at 1, T at 3, leaving 4 unused. We only have I and T left to place, so 4 must be blank? No, we need 5 letters total and we have fixed O and N. So the remaining three positions (1,3,4) must contain I and T plus one more, but we only have two letters (I,T) to place in the three unknowns? Not possible.

   Actually we have two letters (I,T) that must appear in positions 1,3,4. Since we have three positions and only two letters, the third must be one of the remaining consonants.

   Therefore the word must contain I, T, O, N plus one more consonant from B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

   Re-express: The word is a permutation of {O, N, I, T, ?} with:
   - O at 2
   - N at 5
   - I somewhere in {1,3,4}
   - T somewhere in {3,4} (cannot be 1 or 2)

   Let’s enumerate valid English words fitting _ O _ _ N that contain both I and T (and no eliminated letters).

   – B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y are available.

   Try:
   - H O I T N → “HOITN” – not a word
   - B O I T N → “BOITN” – not a word
   - M O I T N → “MOITN” – not a word
   - P O I T N → “POITN” – not a word
   - T O I _ N → “TOI_N” – no valid English word
   - F O I T N → “FOITN” – not a word
   - W O I T N → “WOITN” – not a word
   - Y O I T N → “YOITN” – not a word
   - H O T I N → “HOTIN” – not a word
   - T O H I N → “THOIN” – not a word
   - B O T I N → “BOTIN” – not a word
   - M O T I N → “MOTIN” – not a word
   - P O T I N → “POTIN” – not a word
   - K O T I N → “KOTIN” – not a word
   - F O T I N → “FOTIN” – not a word
   - W O T I N → “WOTIN” – not a word
   - B O T N I – but N must be last

   Wait—there is a real English word that fits _ O _ _ N and uses I and T appropriately: “JOINT”. But J is not yet tested; it has not been eliminated yet.

   J is not in the excluded list (excluded so far: C,R,A,E,S,U,D,L,G,X). Therefore J is allowed.

   So:
   J O I T N = “JOINT”
   - J (new, allowed)
   - O (2, fixed)
   - I (must appear, placed in 3)
   - T (must appear, placed in 4)
   - N (5, fixed)

   This satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “JOINT”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z
4. Be a valid 5-letter word

Common starting words that people use include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words due to its use of very common letters and good vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are all **not** in the word (x).
- N is in the word and in the **correct final position** (✓).

So we know:
- Word ends with N.
- Letters C, R, A, E are not used at all.
- We still need to determine the first four letters.

Good next steps:
1. Pick letters that are common but weren’t tested yet (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U, D).
2. Avoid C, R, A, E.
3. Keep N in the last position.

Possible candidates:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but E is excluded.
- SLUNG (S, L, U, N, G) – G not yet tested.
- STINT (S, T, I, N, T) – repeats T, and T is common.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – tests S, O, U, D.

""SOUND"" seems good because:
- It tests S, O, U, D – all new letters.
- Keeps N in position 5.
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- Known letters and positions: N at position 5, O at position 2.
- Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
- Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4.

Good letters still available (common, not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

We need:
- First letter: any new consonant.
- Third letter: any new consonant or vowel (but O already used, and A, E, U excluded → possible I).
- Fourth letter: same.

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ N with letters from remaining good set.

Candidates:
- FOILN – but FOILN isn’t a word.
- POINT – but I is untested, P/T are good, but T is very common.
- GOING – but G and I are untested, N is already known for last position.
- MONEY – uses M, N, E, Y – but E is excluded.
- HINGE – E excluded.
- BINGO – but B and I are untested, G too, but O is already in position 2.
- TONIC – but C is excluded.

Wait, we must avoid letters already excluded: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
O and N are correctly placed.

Consider ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (correct), I (new), N (correct), T (new).
- But N must be at position 5, so POINT would be P O I N T → but N is position 4 here, which conflicts.
Oops, that’s wrong because N must be at 5th.

So pattern is _ O _ _ N.

Best candidate: ""WOMIN"" – but WOMIN isn’t a valid word.
""LOGIN"" – L, O, G, I, N – valid word, uses new letters L, G, I.
""LOGIN"" fits _ O _ _ N: L O G I N.

Check letters:
- L: new, allowed
- O: correct, position 2
- G: new, allowed
- I: new, allowed
- N: correct, position 5

No conflicts with excluded letters.

Thus, ""LOGIN"" is a good next guess.

        - POI_N → “POINT” (but N must be at 5, so POINT is P O I N T – N is 4th, invalid)  
        - TOI_N → “TOING” – not valid  
        - HOI_N → “HOING” – not valid  
        - BOI_N → “BOINK” – K is allowed, ends N, fits _ O I _ N → B O I N K? No K is at end. Word “BOINK” is valid and ends with K, not N.  
        - FOILN – invalid  
        - POI_N – none ending N  
        - VOILN – invalid  
   - Try I in position 3: _ O I _ N  
        - “TOXIN” – X allowed? X not yet eliminated. T,O,X,I,N – O in 2, I in 3, N in 5. X is a new letter.  
        - “FOXIN” – F allowed, but “FOXIN” not a word.  
        - “HOXIN” – invalid  
        - “POI_N” – none valid  
        - “TOXIN” is actually a valid word.

7. “TOXIN” uses:
   - T (new) O (fixed) X (new) I (must be used) N (fixed)  
   - No eliminated letters.  
   - Satisfies the constraints.

Therefore, “TOXIN” is the logical guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. Positions locked:
   - 2: O (✓)
   - 5: N (✓)

2. Letter statuses:
   - Eliminated: C, R, A, E, S, U, D, L, G, X
   - Must appear, but we still don’t know where: I and T
   - Both I and T received “-”, meaning:
        – I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from LOGIN and TOXIN feedback)
        – T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from TOXIN feedback)
   - Therefore:
        – I must be in position 1 or 4
        – T must be in position 2, 3, or 4
   - But position 2 is already O, so T can only be 3 or 4
   - Position 1 can be I or T, but T cannot be at 1 anyway

3. Pattern we must fill:
   _ O _ _ N

   Possible placements of I and T:
   Option A: I is in position 1 → I O _ _ N
        – Remaining letter in 4 must be T → I O _ T N
        – The blank in 3 must be from remaining allowed consonants: B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y
        – Valid English word: I O (consonant) T N
        – Scanning, “IOBTN”, “IOFTN”, etc. → none are valid.
        – “IONIC” – but N at 5 not satisfied.
        – No valid 5-letter word matches I O ? T N.

   Option B: I is in position 4 → _ O I _ N
        – Then T must be in position 3 → _ O I T N
        – Position 1: any remaining allowed consonant B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y
        – We need a word shaped ? O I T N
        – Check dictionary: “POINT” (P O I N T) – but N must be 5, so “POINT” has N at 4, invalid.
        – “FOITN” – invalid.
        – “MOITN” – invalid.
        – The actual valid word that fits _ O I T N is “HOIST” – but ends with T, not N.
        – The only dictionary entry ending “OITN” is “POINT”, which is invalid because N must be 5.
        – “VOITN” – invalid.
        – “BOITN” – invalid.

   Option C: I is in position 4 and T in position 3 → same as above, no valid word.

   Option D: I is in position 1 and T in position 4 → same as Option A, no valid word.

   Hold on—let’s re-check the dictionary quickly for any hidden word matching ? O ? T N or ? O I T N.

   Real pattern: _ O _ _ N
   We now know the two missing letters are I and T, and each must occupy one of the blanks.

   Possible letter orderings inside _ O _ _ N:
   1. I O T _ N  – but that would have I at 1, T at 3, leaving 4 unused. We only have I and T left to place, so 4 must be blank? No, we need 5 letters total and we have fixed O and N. So the remaining three positions (1,3,4) must contain I and T plus one more, but we only have two letters (I,T) to place in the three unknowns? Not possible.

   Actually we have two letters (I,T) that must appear in positions 1,3,4. Since we have three positions and only two letters, the third must be one of the remaining consonants.

   Therefore the word must contain I, T, O, N plus one more consonant from B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

   Re-express: The word is a permutation of {O, N, I, T, ?} with:
   - O at 2
   - N at 5
   - I somewhere in {1,3,4}
   - T somewhere in {3,4} (cannot be 1 or 2)

   Let’s enumerate valid English words fitting _ O _ _ N that contain both I and T (and no eliminated letters).

   – B, F, H, K, M, P, W, Y are available.

   Try:
   - H O I T N → “HOITN” – not a word
   - B O I T N → “BOITN” – not a word
   - M O I T N → “MOITN” – not a word
   - P O I T N → “POITN” – not a word
   - T O I _ N → “TOI_N” – no valid English word
   - F O I T N → “FOITN” – not a word
   - W O I T N → “WOITN” – not a word
   - Y O I T N → “YOITN” – not a word
   - H O T I N → “HOTIN” – not a word
   - T O H I N → “THOIN” – not a word
   - B O T I N → “BOTIN” – not a word
   - M O T I N → “MOTIN” – not a word
   - P O T I N → “POTIN” – not a word
   - K O T I N → “KOTIN” – not a word
   - F O T I N → “FOTIN” – not a word
   - W O T I N → “WOTIN” – not a word
   - B O T N I – but N must be last

   Wait—there is a real English word that fits _ O _ _ N and uses I and T appropriately: “JOINT”. But J is not yet tested; it has not been eliminated yet.

   J is not in the excluded list (excluded so far: C,R,A,E,S,U,D,L,G,X). Therefore J is allowed.

   So:
   J O I T N = “JOINT”
   - J (new, allowed)
   - O (2, fixed)
   - I (must appear, placed in 3)
   - T (must appear, placed in 4)
   - N (5, fixed)

   This satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “JOINT”.
