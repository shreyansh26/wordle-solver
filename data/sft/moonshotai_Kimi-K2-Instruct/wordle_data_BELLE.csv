For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me identify several letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

So far we know:
- E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- R, A, I, S are not in the word at all.

That means we need a 5-letter word ending in E that does not contain R, A, I, or S.

Common 5-letter words ending in E that avoid those letters:
- BLOOM (but ends in M)
- CHUTE, GLUTE, etc. but they contain letters we've ruled out.
- TONER (but has R)
- BONEY, COWER, DOWER, FOGIE, HOMIE, JONES, KNEEL, LONER (has R), MONEY, NEWER, OLDEN, POWER, QUEEN, ROWER (has R), TOWER, VENUE, WOKEN, YODEL, ZONED.

From these, I'll pick one with mostly common remaining consonants and a vowel that hasn't been ruled out. ""MONEY"" looks promising: M-O-N-E-Y. It ends in E and does not contain R, A, I, or S.

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x); E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5) (✓).
2. MONEY → M, O, N, Y are NOT in the word (x); E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

This tells us:
- The secret word contains the letter E but it is NOT in position 5 (it must be in one of positions 1-4).
- Letters eliminated so far: R, A, I, S, M, O, N, Y.
- Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
- Remaining common vowels: E (already confirmed to be in the word), plus U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, M, O, N, Y).
- Is a valid English word.

Good options could be:
- ""BEEFY"" – but Y is eliminated.
- ""CREEK"" – but R is eliminated.
- ""DWELL"" – no eliminated letters, and E appears in position 2.
- ""FLEET"" – no eliminated letters, and E appears in positions 2 and 4.
- ""GUESS"" – S is eliminated.
- ""TWEET"" – no eliminated letters, and E appears in positions 2 and 4.

Summary of all feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ E is in the word (and was originally placed at position 5).

2. MONEY → M(x) O(x) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ E is NOT at position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4.

3. DWELL → D(x) W(x) E(-) L(✓) L(-)  
   ⇒ L is in position 4 exactly, and the second L is in the word but not at position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters ABSENT: R, A, I, S, M, O, N, Y, D, W  
- Letters PRESENT & fixed: L at position 4  
- Letters PRESENT & unfixed: E (somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3), plus exactly one more L (somewhere other than position 5).  
- Allowed letters still unused: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z plus the two already-known E and L.

Structure so far:  
_ _ _ L _  
with one additional L elsewhere and one E somewhere in the first three positions.

A good next guess should test new consonants while satisfying these constraints.  
Trying to place E in position 1 and the extra L in position 2 gives a candidate:  
E L _ L _

The remaining letter must be from the allowed set and create a valid word.  
ELBOW is invalid (O eliminated), ELFIN is invalid (I eliminated), ELGIN is invalid (G fine, but I eliminated), ELVER is invalid (R eliminated).

How about “ELBOW” → O is eliminated.

“ELECT” → C and T are still allowed, but that would put two E’s which is okay?  
But we have only one E confirmed so far, and we want to test new letters.

A better choice: “BELLE”  
- Uses new letters B (allowed) and repeats L and E.  
- Pattern: B E L L E → but only 2 L’s and 1 E are confirmed, so this is acceptable.

But we already know position 4 is L, so BELLE gives:  
B E L L E → positions: 1=B, 2=E, 3=L, 4=L, 5=E.  
Cross-check rules:  
- L at 4 is ✓ (matches known).  
- E at 2 and 5: we know E exists and is not at 5, so 5=E would give (-), confirming E not at 5 again.  
- B and E and extra L are all new info.

This looks informative.

Actually, let me choose a simpler pattern:  
Place E at position 3 and extra L at position 2:  
_ L E L _

A valid word fitting this is “BLELL”? No, that’s not a word.

Try “FLEET”: but E repeats and position 4 already fixed as L, so “FLEET” = F L E E T → invalid because position 4 must be L.

Another candidate: “HELLO” → O eliminated.

Try “JELLY” → Y eliminated.

Try “KELLY” → same Y.

Try “PELLA” → A eliminated.

Try “TELLY” → Y eliminated.

Let’s re-frame: fixed L at 4, one more L must appear elsewhere (positions 1,2,3,5).  
Also E must appear in 1,2, or 3.

Simplest pattern: E at 1, extra L at 2 → E L _ L _  
Need a valid word: E L _ L _  
“ELBOW” – O eliminated.  
“ELFIN” – I eliminated.  
“ELGIN” – I eliminated.  
“ELVER” – R eliminated.

Switch: E at 2, extra L at 1 → L E _ L _  
Valid word: L E V E L → but that has second E at 4 which must be L, fails.  
L E G A L → A eliminated.  
L E T H L – no.

Switch: E at 3, extra L at 2 → _ L E L _  
“BLELL” – invalid.  
“CLELL” – invalid.

Switch: extra L at 5 and E in 1-3:  
_ _ _ L L  
E _ _ L L  
Possible word: “LEVEL” – has second E at 4 which must be L, fails.

Another candidate: “PELLS” – S eliminated.

Try “FELLS” – S eliminated.

Re-examine constraints more carefully.  
We need exactly five letters with:
- Position 4 = L  
- One more L elsewhere (positions 1,2,3,5)  
- One E in positions 1,2, or 3  
- No letters from {R,A,I,S,M,O,N,Y,D,W}

Lets list remaining letters:  
Allowed: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,P,Q,T,U,V,X,Z

We need a valid English word of form:
- _ _ E L L  
- _ E _ L L  
- E _ _ L L  
- _ _ L L E (but E must be in 1-3, so this pattern impossible)  
- L _ E L _  
- L E _ L _  
- E L _ L _  
- etc.

The only valid English word I can see that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters is:

“KELLY” – but Y is eliminated.

“BELLE” is valid and fits the constraints:

B E L L E → letters used: B, E, L, L, E  
- B allowed, E allowed, L allowed (position 4 ✓), extra L at 3, extra E at 5.  
- E at 5 will give (-) again, confirming E is not at 5.  
- Will test B, and positions of remaining letters.

So “BELLE” seems the best next informative guess.
