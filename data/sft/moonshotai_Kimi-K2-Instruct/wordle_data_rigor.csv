For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It has no repeated letters, which gives us information about 5 different letters
3. These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words

This should give us strong initial feedback about which key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(-) – R is in the word, but not in the 2nd position.  
O(-) – O is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O (but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A, S, E.
- Positions 1, 4, 5 are still unknown.

We need a word that:
- keeps R and O somewhere (but R not in slot 2, O not in slot 3),
- avoids the eliminated letters A, S, E.

Possible common letters left: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

To maximize information, choose a word with new common letters plus R and O. 
“TRIOL” is valid but uncommon. “FRONT” uses F (rare). “WORLD” is good but has L and D only. 
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D – all common, and respects the constraints:
- R not in position 2.  
- O not in position 3.  
- No A, S, E.

That seems like the best next guess.

From the two rounds so far:

Round 1 (arose):
- A, S, E are out.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.

Round 2 (round):
- R is confirmed in position 1 (R✓).
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- U, N, D are out.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with R (position 1).
- Contains O but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and round).
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Remaining common letters and their possible positions:
  – O can be in position 4 or 5.
  – Need three other letters from the remaining: T, I, L, C, G, M, P, H, B, K, F, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a new set of three common, unused letters and place O in position 4 (since position 5 is also possible but we have to pick one to maximize info).

Candidate word: R _ _ O _ with new letters.

Possible: R I C O _ – but “RICO_” looks limited.
Better: R O _ _ _ – but O can’t be in pos 2 or 3, so O must be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try a word with O in position 4:
R _ _ O _ → need three letters for positions 2,3,5.

Good combo: R I G O T – but RIGOT is not a word.
How about R I G O N – but N is out.
R I G O L – RIGOL is archaic.
R I V O T – “RIVOT” is not valid.
R I G O R – double R is acceptable, but RIGOR is valid.
R E G O R – but E is out.
R I G O R is valid, but R is already confirmed in position 1, so repeating R in position 5 is allowed, but gives less info.

Alternative: place O in position 5 and try new letters in 2,3,4.
R _ _ _ O → need three new letters.

Try R I C H O – valid and uses new letters C, H, I.

This seems optimal: RICHO covers three new letters (I, C, H) and puts O in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s check constraints:
- Starts with R ✓.
- Contains O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3).
- Uses new letters I, C, H.
- No A, S, E, U, N, D.

Hence, RICHO is a solid next guess.

Alternative: place O in position 5 and try new letters in 2,3,4.
R _ _ _ O → need three new letters.

Try R I C H O – valid and uses new letters C, H, I.

This seems optimal: RICHO covers three new letters (I, C, H) and puts O in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s check constraints:
- Starts with R ✓.
- Contains O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3).
- Uses new letters I, C, H.
- No A, S, E, U, N, D.

Hence, RICHO is a solid next guess.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – R is in the word, not in position 2.  
   – O is in the word, not in position 3.  
   – A, S, E are out.

2. round → R(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is fixed in position 1.  
   – O is in the word, not in position 2.  
   – U, N, D are out.

3. richo → R(✓) I(✓) C(x) H(x) O(-)  
   – R is fixed in position 1.  
   – I is fixed in position 2.  
   – C, H are out.  
   – O is in the word, not in position 5 (because the feedback shows “O(-)”, i.e., O is in the word but not in position 5).

Combining these facts:
- Word pattern so far: R I _ _ _  
- Must contain O, and O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
  – Position 2 is already I, so that’s irrelevant.  
  – Thus O must be in position 4.  
- Letters ruled out so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, C, H.  
- Remaining common letters usable in positions 3 and 5: B, F, G, K, L, M, P, T, Y.

Hence the word must be: R I _ O _

To maximize information with one guess, we can pick a letter for position 3 that is common and another for position 5. Let’s choose R I G O T (the word “rigot” is not valid) – wait, let’s pick an actual word.

Valid 5-letter word that fits R I _ O _ and only uses allowed letters: R I V O T → no, “rivot” is not a word.  
R I G O R → valid, but we already placed R at position 1 and O at 4, so R I G O R would be acceptable. However, we’d be repeating R in position 5, which is allowed but might give less info.  

Another valid word: R I G O T → invalid.  
R I G O N → N is out.  
R I L O T → “rilto” is invalid.  
R I M O T → invalid.  
R I P O T → invalid.  
R I V O L → invalid.  
R I P O N → N is out.  
R I T O N → N is out.  
R I G O T → invalid.  
R I P O T → invalid.

Actually, the only common word that fits R I _ O _ from the allowed letters is R I G O R (rigor). Even though it repeats R, it’s the only valid word that fits, so we’ll go with it.

We could also consider R I V O L (invalid), R I N O T (invalid), etc., but none seem valid. The only valid word fitting the constraints is R I G O R.

Let’s verify:  
- R (position 1) ✓  
- I (position 2) ✓  
- O (position 4) ✓  
- Letters used: R, I, G, O, R – only G is new, but this is the only valid 5-letter word.

So we’ll go with rigor.

However, let’s double-check for any other valid words. Another possible word is R I G O T – but that’s not a word. R I K O T – invalid. R I B O T – invalid. R I F O T – invalid. R I L O N – invalid. R I L O T – invalid. R I M O T – invalid. R I P O T – invalid. R I Z O T – invalid. R I V O T – invalid.

Thus, the only valid word is R I G O R. We’ll proceed with that.
