For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Words with frequently used vowels and consonants are ideal. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and overall)
- L (common consonant)
- A (the most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters in the English language, which should provide helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.

- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is the 4th letter.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

1. The word has the pattern __ __ __ T __.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.

Next, pick a word that:

- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A common word fitting these criteria is “TRIUM” but that’s 5 letters and uses U. However “TRIUM” has T in 4th spot? No, T is 1st in “TRIUM”. We need T in 4th spot.

Let’s think of 5-letter words with T in 4th position and no S, L, A, E. Examples:

- “JOINT” – has T in 4th, uses J, O, I, N (all allowed).
- “MOUNT” – has T in 4th, uses M, O, U, N (all allowed).

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 4 is T (from SLATE: T✓).
2. From JOINT:
   - J, O, N are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since T was already known to be in position 4, this is consistent and doesn’t add new info).

So:
- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Known: _ _ _ T _
- I appears somewhere, but NOT in position 3.

Remaining vowels to test/confirm: U (since A, E, O eliminated, I is in word)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a 5-letter word with:
- T in position 4
- Does not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Contains I (but I cannot be in position 3)
- Preferably introduces new common letters

Possible candidates:
- “BUILT” – contains L and U (but L is eliminated)
- “CRIMP” – no T
- “FRUIT” – ends with T, but T must be position 4, so this is _ _ _ T _ and “FRUIT” is _ _ _ I T (invalid)
- “RIGHT” – R I G H T → T is position 5, invalid
- “QUIRT” – Q U I R T → T is position 5, invalid
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “TRIUM” – T is position 1, invalid
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5, invalid
- “UNITY” – N and T are positions 1 and 5, invalid
- “QUICK” – no T

Wait, we need T in position 4, so the word must look like _ _ _ T _.

Let me think of words ending with T, but with T in position 4. That’s actually impossible because position 5 would then be the 5th character. So I need words with T in position 4, meaning the word ends with T and some letter after it. But 5-letter word ending with T would have T in position 5. That contradicts my understanding.

Wait no, the word is 5 letters, positions 1-5. SLATE feedback says T is in position 4 (✓), so pattern is _ _ _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,T,5).

JOINT feedback says T is in word but wrong position (-), but we already know T is in position 4 (from SLATE), so this is redundant info confirming T is indeed in position 4.

So possible words:
- _ _ _ T _ with T fixed in position 4
- Must contain I somewhere (but not position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N

Let’s list possible words:
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “FRUIT” – F R U I T → T is position 5, invalid
- “PIVOT” – contains O (eliminated) and T is position 5
- “CURIT” – not a valid English word
- “MURIT” – not valid
- “FURIT” – not valid
- “BURIT” – not valid
- “CIRCU” – no T
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5
- “VIRTU” – V I R T U → T is position 4, but contains U which is allowed, and I is in position 2
   - Check letters: V, I, R, T, U
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S, L, A, E, J, O, N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (not 3) – allowed
   - T is in position 4 – matches known
   - This seems valid
- “CIRCA” – contains A (eliminated)

“VIRTU” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “virtue”), but might be obscure. Alternatively:

“CIRCA” is invalid (A eliminated), “VIRID” – no T
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“PIRCH” – no T
“BIRTH” – T is position 5
“FIRTH” – T is position 5
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“MIRTH” – T is position 5
“VIRGA” – contains A
“VIRID” – no T

“VIRTU” seems the only valid candidate so far ending with T in position 4.

But let’s think of others:

“DICHT” – not valid
“RICTU” – not valid
“FICTI” – not valid
“RICTI” – not valid

“VIRTU” appears the best available.

However, “VIRTU” is a bit obscure. Is there a more common word?

“RIGID” – no T
“CIGAR” – no T
“VIGOR” – contains O
“VIGIL” – contains L
“VIGIA” – contains A
“VIGIA” – contains A

Not finding better. “VIRTU” it is.

But actually, let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ _ T _, so:

- Position 1, 2, 3, 5 are open
- Must contain I (not in position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- T is in position 4

Possible word: “BIRTH” – but T is position 5
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“FURTH” – not valid
“MURTH” – not valid
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“HURTY” – not valid
“PIETY” – contains E
“PIRCH” – no T
“VIRUS” – contains S

Wait, I think I’m missing the pattern. The word must have T in position 4, so:

Examples:
- _ _ _ T _ :
   - “BURNT” – T is position 5
   - “BUILT” – T is position 5
   - “FRUIT” – T is position 5
   - “DIRTY” – T is position 5

Ah! I see my mistake. I was thinking position 4 is the 4th letter, but in a 5-letter word, position 4 is the 4th letter, so _ _ _ T _ means the word ends with T and some letter after, which is impossible for 5-letter word. Actually, positions are 1-5, so _ _ _ T _ means positions 1,2,3,T,5, i.e., 4th letter is T.

So valid words:
- “BURNT” – B U R N T → T is position 5, invalid
- “DIRTY” – D I R T Y → T is position 4! This fits
   - Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S,L,A,E,J,O,N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
   - T is in position 4 – matches
   - This seems perfect
- “FIRTH” – T is position 5
- “GIRTH” – T is position 5
- “MIRTH” – T is position 5

“DIRTY” seems to be the best common word fitting all constraints.

<guess>DIRTY</guess>",DIRTY,"Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 4 is T (from SLATE: T✓).

   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since T was already known to be in position 4, this is consistent and doesn’t add new info).

So:

Possible candidates:

- “CRIMP” – no T
- “FRUIT” – ends with T, but T must be position 4, so this is _ _ _ T _ and “FRUIT” is _ _ _ I T (invalid)
- “RIGHT” – R I G H T → T is position 5, invalid

- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “TRIUM” – T is position 1, invalid
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5, invalid

“VIRTU” seems the only valid candidate so far ending with T in position 4.

But let’s think of others:

“DICHT” – not valid
“RICTU” – not valid
“FICTI” – not valid
“RICTI” – not valid

“VIRTU” appears the best available.

However, “VIRTU” is a bit obscure. Is there a more common word?

“RIGID” – no T
“CIGAR” – no T
“VIGOR” – contains O
“VIGIL” – contains L
“VIGIA” – contains A
“VIGIA” – contains A

Not finding better. “VIRTU” it is.

But actually, let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ _ T _, so:

- Position 1, 2, 3, 5 are open
- Must contain I (not in position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- T is in position 4

Possible word: “BIRTH” – but T is position 5
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“FURTH” – not valid
“MURTH” – not valid
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“HURTY” – not valid
“PIETY” – contains E
“PIRCH” – no T
“VIRUS” – contains S

Wait, I think I’m missing the pattern. The word must have T in position 4, so:

Examples:
- _ _ _ T _ :
   - “BURNT” – T is position 5
   - “BUILT” – T is position 5
   - “FRUIT” – T is position 5
   - “DIRTY” – T is position 5

Ah! I see my mistake. I was thinking position 4 is the 4th letter, but in a 5-letter word, position 4 is the 4th letter, so _ _ _ T _ means the word ends with T and some letter after, which is impossible for 5-letter word. Actually, positions are 1-5, so _ _ _ T _ means positions 1,2,3,T,5, i.e., 4th letter is T.

So valid words:
- “BURNT” – B U R N T → T is position 5, invalid
- “DIRTY” – D I R T Y → T is position 4! This fits
   - Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S,L,A,E,J,O,N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
   - T is in position 4 – matches
   - This seems perfect
- “FIRTH” – T is position 5
- “GIRTH” – T is position 5
- “MIRTH” – T is position 5

“DIRTY” seems to be the best common word fitting all constraints.",Guess 3: DIRTY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) R(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,fifty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Words with frequently used vowels and consonants are ideal. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and overall)
- L (common consonant)
- A (the most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters in the English language, which should provide helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is the 4th letter.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern __ __ __ T __.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.

Next, pick a word that:
- Uses T in the 4th spot.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A common word fitting these criteria is “TRIUM” but that’s 5 letters and uses U. However “TRIUM” has T in 4th spot? No, T is 1st in “TRIUM”. We need T in 4th spot.

Let’s think of 5-letter words with T in 4th position and no S, L, A, E. Examples:
- “BUILT” – but contains L (excluded).
- “JOINT” – has T in 4th, uses J, O, I, N (all allowed).
- “MOUNT” – has T in 4th, uses M, O, U, N (all allowed).

“JOINT” seems good as it introduces J, O, I, N which are all new letters and might give more info.

<guess>JOINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: JOINT -> FEEDBACK: J(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 4 is T (from SLATE: T✓).
2. From JOINT:
   - J, O, N are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since T was already known to be in position 4, this is consistent and doesn’t add new info).

So:
- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Known: _ _ _ T _
- I appears somewhere, but NOT in position 3.

Remaining vowels to test/confirm: U (since A, E, O eliminated, I is in word)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a 5-letter word with:
- T in position 4
- Does not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Contains I (but I cannot be in position 3)
- Preferably introduces new common letters

Possible candidates:
- “BUILT” – contains L and U (but L is eliminated)
- “CRIMP” – no T
- “FRUIT” – ends with T, but T must be position 4, so this is _ _ _ T _ and “FRUIT” is _ _ _ I T (invalid)
- “RIGHT” – R I G H T → T is position 5, invalid
- “QUIRT” – Q U I R T → T is position 5, invalid
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “TRIUM” – T is position 1, invalid
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5, invalid
- “UNITY” – N and T are positions 1 and 5, invalid
- “QUICK” – no T

Wait, we need T in position 4, so the word must look like _ _ _ T _.

Let me think of words ending with T, but with T in position 4. That’s actually impossible because position 5 would then be the 5th character. So I need words with T in position 4, meaning the word ends with T and some letter after it. But 5-letter word ending with T would have T in position 5. That contradicts my understanding.

Wait no, the word is 5 letters, positions 1-5. SLATE feedback says T is in position 4 (✓), so pattern is _ _ _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,T,5).

JOINT feedback says T is in word but wrong position (-), but we already know T is in position 4 (from SLATE), so this is redundant info confirming T is indeed in position 4.

So possible words:
- _ _ _ T _ with T fixed in position 4
- Must contain I somewhere (but not position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N

Let’s list possible words:
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “FRUIT” – F R U I T → T is position 5, invalid
- “PIVOT” – contains O (eliminated) and T is position 5
- “CURIT” – not a valid English word
- “MURIT” – not valid
- “FURIT” – not valid
- “BURIT” – not valid
- “CIRCU” – no T
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5
- “VIRTU” – V I R T U → T is position 4, but contains U which is allowed, and I is in position 2
   - Check letters: V, I, R, T, U
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S, L, A, E, J, O, N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (not 3) – allowed
   - T is in position 4 – matches known
   - This seems valid
- “CIRCA” – contains A (eliminated)

“VIRTU” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “virtue”), but might be obscure. Alternatively:

“CIRCA” is invalid (A eliminated), “VIRID” – no T
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“PIRCH” – no T
“BIRTH” – T is position 5
“FIRTH” – T is position 5
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“MIRTH” – T is position 5
“VIRGA” – contains A
“VIRID” – no T

“VIRTU” seems the only valid candidate so far ending with T in position 4.

But let’s think of others:

“DICHT” – not valid
“RICTU” – not valid
“FICTI” – not valid

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Words with frequently used vowels and consonants are ideal. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and overall)
- L (common consonant)
- A (the most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters in the English language, which should provide helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and is the 4th letter.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern __ __ __ T __.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.

Next, pick a word that:
- Uses T in the 4th spot.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A common word fitting these criteria is “TRIUM” but that’s 5 letters and uses U. However “TRIUM” has T in 4th spot? No, T is 1st in “TRIUM”. We need T in 4th spot.

Let’s think of 5-letter words with T in 4th position and no S, L, A, E. Examples:
- “BUILT” – but contains L (excluded).
- “JOINT” – has T in 4th, uses J, O, I, N (all allowed).
- “MOUNT” – has T in 4th, uses M, O, U, N (all allowed).

“JOINT” seems good as it introduces J, O, I, N which are all new letters and might give more info.

<guess>JOINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: JOINT -> FEEDBACK: J(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Position 4 is T (from SLATE: T✓).
2. From JOINT:
   - J, O, N are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since T was already known to be in position 4, this is consistent and doesn’t add new info).

So:
- Letters eliminated: S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Known: _ _ _ T _
- I appears somewhere, but NOT in position 3.

Remaining vowels to test/confirm: U (since A, E, O eliminated, I is in word)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a 5-letter word with:
- T in position 4
- Does not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- Contains I (but I cannot be in position 3)
- Preferably introduces new common letters

Possible candidates:
- “BUILT” – contains L and U (but L is eliminated)
- “CRIMP” – no T
- “FRUIT” – ends with T, but T must be position 4, so this is _ _ _ T _ and “FRUIT” is _ _ _ I T (invalid)
- “RIGHT” – R I G H T → T is position 5, invalid
- “QUIRT” – Q U I R T → T is position 5, invalid
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “TRIUM” – T is position 1, invalid
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5, invalid
- “UNITY” – N and T are positions 1 and 5, invalid
- “QUICK” – no T

Wait, we need T in position 4, so the word must look like _ _ _ T _.

Let me think of words ending with T, but with T in position 4. That’s actually impossible because position 5 would then be the 5th character. So I need words with T in position 4, meaning the word ends with T and some letter after it. But 5-letter word ending with T would have T in position 5. That contradicts my understanding.

Wait no, the word is 5 letters, positions 1-5. SLATE feedback says T is in position 4 (✓), so pattern is _ _ _ T _ (positions 1,2,3,T,5).

JOINT feedback says T is in word but wrong position (-), but we already know T is in position 4 (from SLATE), so this is redundant info confirming T is indeed in position 4.

So possible words:
- _ _ _ T _ with T fixed in position 4
- Must contain I somewhere (but not position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N

Let’s list possible words:
- “BRISK” – contains S and K, but S eliminated
- “FRUIT” – F R U I T → T is position 5, invalid
- “PIVOT” – contains O (eliminated) and T is position 5
- “CURIT” – not a valid English word
- “MURIT” – not valid
- “FURIT” – not valid
- “BURIT” – not valid
- “CIRCU” – no T
- “DIRTY” – T is position 5
- “VIRTU” – V I R T U → T is position 4, but contains U which is allowed, and I is in position 2
   - Check letters: V, I, R, T, U
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S, L, A, E, J, O, N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (not 3) – allowed
   - T is in position 4 – matches known
   - This seems valid
- “CIRCA” – contains A (eliminated)

“VIRTU” is a valid 5-letter word (variant spelling of “virtue”), but might be obscure. Alternatively:

“CIRCA” is invalid (A eliminated), “VIRID” – no T
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“PIRCH” – no T
“BIRTH” – T is position 5
“FIRTH” – T is position 5
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“MIRTH” – T is position 5
“VIRGA” – contains A
“VIRID” – no T

“VIRTU” seems the only valid candidate so far ending with T in position 4.

But let’s think of others:

“DICHT” – not valid
“RICTU” – not valid
“FICTI” – not valid
“RICTI” – not valid

“VIRTU” appears the best available.

However, “VIRTU” is a bit obscure. Is there a more common word?

“RIGID” – no T
“CIGAR” – no T
“VIGOR” – contains O
“VIGIL” – contains L
“VIGIA” – contains A
“VIGIA” – contains A

Not finding better. “VIRTU” it is.

But actually, let me re-examine: the pattern is _ _ _ T _, so:

- Position 1, 2, 3, 5 are open
- Must contain I (not in position 3)
- Must not contain S, L, A, E, J, O, N
- T is in position 4

Possible word: “BIRTH” – but T is position 5
“DIRTY” – T is position 5
“FURTH” – not valid
“MURTH” – not valid
“GIRTH” – T is position 5
“HURTY” – not valid
“PIETY” – contains E
“PIRCH” – no T
“VIRUS” – contains S

Wait, I think I’m missing the pattern. The word must have T in position 4, so:

Examples:
- _ _ _ T _ :
   - “BURNT” – T is position 5
   - “BUILT” – T is position 5
   - “FRUIT” – T is position 5
   - “DIRTY” – T is position 5

Ah! I see my mistake. I was thinking position 4 is the 4th letter, but in a 5-letter word, position 4 is the 4th letter, so _ _ _ T _ means the word ends with T and some letter after, which is impossible for 5-letter word. Actually, positions are 1-5, so _ _ _ T _ means positions 1,2,3,T,5, i.e., 4th letter is T.

So valid words:
- “BURNT” – B U R N T → T is position 5, invalid
- “DIRTY” – D I R T Y → T is position 4! This fits
   - Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y
   - Eliminated letters: none of these (S,L,A,E,J,O,N not present)
   - I is in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
   - T is in position 4 – matches
   - This seems perfect
- “FIRTH” – T is position 5
- “GIRTH” – T is position 5
- “MIRTH” – T is position 5

“DIRTY” seems to be the best common word fitting all constraints.

<guess>DIRTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: JOINT -> FEEDBACK: J(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: DIRTY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) R(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions fixed:
   - T must be in position 4 (from SLATE).
   - I must be in position 2 (DIRTY showed I ✓ there).
   - Y must be in position 5 (DIRTY showed Y ✓ there).

   So the word looks like:  _  I  _  T  Y

2. Letters ruled out:
   S, L, A, E, J, O, N, D, R

3. Remaining consonants and vowels that could still appear:
   Allowed: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
   (U is the only vowel left, since A, E, O are gone and I is already used in position 2)

4. The missing letters are positions 1 and 3 (the pattern:  _  I  _  T  Y ).

5. Candidate words fitting _ I _ T Y:
   - B I T T Y  →  BITTY (but T already used in position 4, no restriction on letter reuse)
   - C I T T Y  →  CITTY  (not common)
   - C I G T Y  →  not a word
   - F I G T Y  →  not a word
   - H I K T Y  →  not a word
   - K I T T Y  →  KITTY
   - M I G T Y  →  MIGTY  (not a word)
   - P I T T Y  →  PITTY  (less common)
   - W I T T Y  →  WITTY
   - Q U I T Y  →  not a word
   - V I G T Y  →  not a word

Valid 5-letter English words in _ I _ T Y:
   - BITTY, KITTY, PITTY, WITTY

All four contain T twice (positions 3 & 4) so they don’t break any rule.
Among them, “KITTY” is very common and introduces K, which is still untested.

Therefore KITTY is the best next guess.

The only 5-letter word left that matches every clue is:

<guess>FIFTY</guess>",FIFTY,"Current constraints after four guesses:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2: I (✓)
   - Position 4: T (✓)
   - Position 5: Y (✓)
   Pattern so far: _ I _ T Y

2. Eliminated letters:
   S, L, A, E, J, O, N, D, R, K

3. KITTY feedback:
   - T in position 3 is marked (-) → T appears in the word but is NOT in position 3.
   - Since position 4 is already T, this simply confirms the single T is in position 4.

4. Letters still available for positions 1 and 3:
   Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
   Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)
