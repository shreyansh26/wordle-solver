For my first guess in a Wordle game, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should include frequently used letters in English words, especially vowels like A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives me a high chance of getting at least one or more hits (correct letters or correct positions), which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid first choice.

From the feedback on A R O S E:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(✓) → R is correct in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is correct in position 5.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Contains the letters: A, R, E
- Does NOT contain: O, S

Next step is to find a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except A, R, E (since A is wrong in first spot, R is fixed in second, E is fixed in fifth)
2. Has R in position 2
3. Has E in position 5
4. Uses A somewhere (but NOT in first position)
5. Avoids O, S entirely

Possible candidates: brace, brake, brave, craze, crate, crave, graze, grape, grade, grape, frame, flame, etc.

Good second guess should introduce new common letters. ""BRINE"" includes B, N, I, checks A is not in wrong spot, and uses common letters. But let's pick one that maximizes new info.

""CRANE"" is a good choice:
- C is new
- R is fixed in spot 2 (matches)
- A is in spot 3 (not first, so possible for A)
- N is new
- E is fixed in spot 5 (matches)

This tests new letters C, N and confirms A in spot 3 is valid.

- DRANK (but N is eliminated)
- TRAPE (but P allowed)
- GRADE (but D allowed)

Let's test BRAGE? No, BRAGE not a word.
Let's test GRAPE? G R A P E – yes, this is a valid word and uses only allowed letters (no C, N, O, S).

G is unused so far, P is unused so far, and it fits _ R A _ E exactly.

Other close options: GRAPE, GRATE, FRAME, BRACE (invalid C).

Best next guess: GRAPE.

Check:
- G R A P E
- Pattern _ R A _ E ✔
- No forbidden letters ✔
- Tests new letters G, P.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   Pattern so far: _ R _ _ E  
   Letters present: A, R, E  
   Letters absent: O, S, C, N, P  

2. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
   Confirmed pattern: _ R A _ E  

3. GRAPE → G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
   Still pattern: G R A _ E  

So the word is exactly: G R A _ E  
We need one more letter in the 4th spot, and it must NOT be any of: C, N, O, P, S.  
Valid alphabet left: A, B, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit G R A _ E:

- GRADE → D not yet excluded  
- GRAPE → P is now excluded (already guessed and marked x)  
- GRAVE → V not yet excluded  
- GRATE → T not yet excluded  
- GRAZE → Z not yet excluded  
- GRAFE → Not an English word  
- GRAME → Not a standard word  

Most plausible, common, and letter-untested options left: GRADE, GRAVE, GRATE, GRAZE.

We have only one unexcluded common consonant among these for the 4th slot: D, V, T, Z.

Among these, GRADE uses D, GRAVE uses V, GRATE uses T, GRAZE uses Z.

Let's test GRADE next, since D is a very common consonant and hasn’t appeared yet.
