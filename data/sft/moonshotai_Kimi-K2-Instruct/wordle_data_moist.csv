I'm about to make my first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters (vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N) while avoiding letter repetition.

All five letters in CRANE were marked ""x,"" so none of C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters, so I should look for a word that uses letters not in {C,R,A,N,E}.  
A good next step is to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels:

- Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
- Good vowels still available: O, I, U

A word that combines several of these is “SPOIL” (S, P, O, I, L).  
It tests four new common consonants (S, P, L) and two new vowels (O, I) in one shot.  
I’ll go with that.

What we know so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, P, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word, but positions unknown: S, O, I  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, O, I each exactly once.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, P, L.
3. Uses only remaining common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s look for a short list of candidate words that satisfy these constraints.

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: O, I (and possibly U, but we already have O and I)

We need to place S, O, I somewhere in the word and fill the remaining two slots with allowed consonants.

Candidate words:
- DITSO → invalid (P,L not allowed, but D,T,S,O,I: but S,O,I must be present, and this has all three, but D and T are allowed)  
- STOIC → S,T,O,I,C → but C is forbidden.  
- TOXIC → C forbidden.  
- FOIST → F,O,I,S,T → F, T allowed. This looks valid. Contains S, O, I and no forbidden letters.

""FOIST"" uses F, O, I, S, T. Checks all constraints.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters (vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N) while avoiding letter repetition.

A good next step is to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels:

- Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
- Good vowels still available: O, I, U

A word that combines several of these is “SPOIL” (S, P, O, I, L).

We know the last four letters are fixed: OIST.  
Guess 5 eliminated H as the first letter, so the remaining consonants for position 1 that have NOT been ruled out are:

Looking for valid English 5-letter words ending in OIST with one of these starting letters, the only common one is:

MOIST (M is still allowed).
