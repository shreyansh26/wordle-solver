For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a strategically optimal word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
4. Is likely to quickly identify or eliminate many possible letters

Some of the best starting words according to Wordle strategy analysis include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". These words contain very common letters and good vowel coverage.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it’s currently in position 3
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it’s currently in position 4
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it’s currently in position 5

So the target word:
- has L as the 2nd letter
- has A somewhere (not in position 3)
- has T somewhere (not in position 4)
- has E somewhere (not in position 5)
- does NOT have S

I need a 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints and uses as many new common letters as possible to gather more information. I’ll look for a word with:
- 2nd letter = L
- contains A, T, E (in allowed positions)
- avoids positions 3 for A, 4 for T, 5 for E
- introduces new common letters

A good candidate is “PLATE”:
- P is new
- L is fixed in position 2 (✓)
- A is now in position 3 – but A can’t be in position 3 (already disallowed). So this is invalid.

Next try: “ALERT”
- A is in position 1 (allowed, since A can’t be in 3)
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E can’t be in 5)
- R is new
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since T can’t be in 4)

This seems valid:
- L in 2nd position
- A not in 3rd
- T not in 4th (it’s in 5th)
- E not in 5th (it’s in 3rd)
- no S

Thus, “ALERT” is a good next guess.
