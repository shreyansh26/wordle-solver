### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appears anywhere in the secret word.  
To maximize information from the second guess, I need a word that uses none of those letters and introduces several new, common consonants and vowels.  
Good candidate letters that weren’t ruled out include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, B, etc.  
A strong second-guess pattern is a word like “CRONY” or “CHURN”, but to keep it simple and hit common letters, I’ll choose “CRONY”:

- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)

Now we know:

- Letters completely ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R
- Letters confirmed in the word: O, N, Y (but we still don’t know their exact positions)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses ONLY the still-allowed letters (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, C, R).
2. Must include O, N, Y at least once (and possibly a second appearance of one of them).
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out, such as D, I, U, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words that contain O, N, Y and only allowed letters. Some candidates:

- DOING  (D, O, I, N, G) – but it has N and O but not Y.
- BUNNY  (B, U, N, N, Y) – has N and Y but not O.
- COYPU – C is already ruled out.
- YONIC – C ruled out.
- GONYS – G, O, N, Y, S – S is ruled out.
- MOUND – no Y.
- YOUNG – has all three O, N, Y plus U and G.
- WOUND – no Y.
- POUND – no Y.
- HOUND – no Y.

“YOUNG” looks perfect: it contains O, N, Y, and uses only still-allowed letters (Y, O, U, N, G). None of S, L, A, T, E, C, R are present. This should help determine the positions of O, N, Y and introduce two new letters (U, G) for further deduction.

From the new feedback:

- Y is in the word but is in the wrong position (it was first in position 1, now in position 1 again, so it can’t be 1 and must be elsewhere).
- O is in the word but wrong position (was 3, now 2—so it can’t be 2 or 3).  
- N is correctly in position 4.  
- U and G are not in the word at all.

We know the word looks like: _ _ _ N _ (with N fixed in slot 4).

Letters definitely in the word: O, N, Y  
Letters definitely out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, U, G

Still-allowed letters not yet ruled out include: D, I, K, M, P, V, B, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z (but we can ignore uncommon ones).

Pattern so far:
- N is locked at position 4.
- O must go in 1, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- Y must go in 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1).

We need a valid 5-letter word with N in slot 4 that uses O and Y exactly once each, plus three other allowed letters (but we only need one more since we already have three slots filled by O, N, Y). Let’s look for words that fit the pattern.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ N _
- _ O _ N _
- _ _ O N _  (but O can’t be 3, so this is invalid)
- _ _ _ N O
- _ _ Y N O
- etc.

Simplest next word to test positions is “DOING” (D, O, I, N, G), but G is already ruled out.

Next idea: Build a word with remaining letters. Valid remaining consonants: D, I, K, M, P, V, B, F, H…

Try “DOING” – G out.  
Try “POINY” – uses P, O, I, N, Y: all letters still allowed, and it places O, Y in new spots.

Check: P, O, I, N, Y – none of the ruled-out letters are used. It puts N correctly at 4, tests O at 2 and Y at 5, plus new letters P and I.

Therefore, “POINY” is a logical next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appears anywhere in the secret word.  
To maximize information from the second guess, I need a word that uses none of those letters and introduces several new, common consonants and vowels.  
Good candidate letters that weren’t ruled out include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, B, etc.  
A strong second-guess pattern is a word like “CRONY” or “CHURN”, but to keep it simple and hit common letters, I’ll choose “CRONY”:

- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes appears at the end)

None of these letters overlap with any from SLATE, so it should give fresh information.

- Letters completely ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R
- Letters confirmed in the word: O, N, Y (but we still don’t know their exact positions)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses ONLY the still-allowed letters (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, C, R).
2. Must include O, N, Y at least once (and possibly a second appearance of one of them).
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out, such as D, I, U, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words that contain O, N, Y and only allowed letters. Some candidates:

- DOING  (D, O, I, N, G) – but it has N and O but not Y.
- BUNNY  (B, U, N, N, Y) – has N and Y but not O.
- COYPU – C is already ruled out.
- YONIC – C ruled out.
- GONYS – G, O, N, Y, S – S is ruled out.
- MOUND – no Y.
- YOUNG – has all three O, N, Y plus U and G.
- WOUND – no Y.
- POUND – no Y.
- HOUND – no Y.

“YOUNG” looks perfect: it contains O, N, Y, and uses only still-allowed letters (Y, O, U, N, G). None of S, L, A, T, E, C, R are present. This should help determine the positions of O, N, Y and introduce two new letters (U, G) for further deduction.

Quick scan of five-letter words ending in “PNY” (slot 4 N, slot 5 Y) gives:
