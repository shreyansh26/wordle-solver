- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps reveal or eliminate many letters quickly.

Some good starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - all vowels except O)
- CRANE (common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are very common consonants with A, E)

I'll choose CRANE because it has:
1. C - common consonant
2. R - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common vowel

This combination should give good coverage to identify letters in the secret word.

  – E: must be in position 2 (from Guess 2: E(✓))  
  – C: must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 1 (Guess 1) and NOT in position 3 (Guess 2) ⇒ possible positions: 2, 4, or 5
  – R, A, N, D, O, Y are all absent

So the word has the form:
_ E _ _ _
with C appearing once at position 2, 4 or 5; positions 1, 3, 5 (or whatever positions are left) must be filled with letters other than R, A, N, D, O, Y.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting:
- E is in position 2
- C must appear once (not in 1 or 3)
- No R, A, N, D, O, Y

Possible positions for C:
- Position 2: impossible (E is there)
- Position 4
- Position 5

Case 1: C in position 4
word skeleton: _ E _ C _

Case 2: C in position 5

Now pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses other un-eliminated common letters.

Case 2 (_E__C): BEBIC? not valid.  
Another candidate: FENCE? no (N).

  – E: must be in position 2 (from Guess 2: E(✓))  
  – C: must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 1 (Guess 1) and NOT in position 3 (Guess 2) ⇒ possible positions: 2, 4, or 5
  – R, A, N, D, O, Y are all absent

So the word has the form:
_ E _ _ _
with C appearing once at position 2, 4 or 5; positions 1, 3, 5 (or whatever positions are left) must be filled with letters other than R, A, N, D, O, Y.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting:
- E is in position 2
- C must appear once (not in 1 or 3)
- No R, A, N, D, O, Y

Possible positions for C:
- Position 2: impossible (E is there)
- Position 4
- Position 5

Case 1: C in position 4

Case 2: C in position 5

Now pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses other un-eliminated common letters.

Case 1 (_E_C_): BENCH? no (N eliminated). HEFCE? not valid.  
Case 2 (_E__C): BEBIC? not valid.

From the updated feedback we now know:

1. E is still in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at pos 2 in both DECOY and HEMIC)  
2. C is still in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3 or 5 (– marks in CRANE, DECOY, HEMIC).  
   ⇒ C must be at position 4.  
3. H, M, I, R, A, N, D, O, Y are all absent.

So the word skeleton is:
_ E _ C _

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones) include B, F, G, K, L, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  
We need to pick two different letters for positions 1 and 5 from these, forming a valid English word.

Real 5-letter words fitting _ E _ C _ with no banned letters:
- FENCE – N is banned  
- LEECH – H is banned  
- SIEGE – I, G are banned  
- BEECH – B, H are banned  
- BENCH – N, H are banned  
- BELCH – H is banned  
- PECKY – Y is banned

- SPECK – S, K are fine, but word is 5 letters: S P E C K (fits)  
   – S is not banned  
   – P is not banned  
   – K is not banned  
   – Positions: S(1), P(2) conflicts with E, so SPECK is invalid (P would have to be in 2)  
- VEXED – X is allowed, but D is banned  
- … continuing search …

Another valid candidate: JEWEL – but J/E/W/E/L; J not banned, L not banned, but structure doesn’t match _E_C_.

Next candidate: PECKY – already disqualified (Y).  
Next: SPECK – positions: S(1), P(2)=E? no, conflicts.

Wait: must have E in position 2.

Look specifically for pattern _ E _ C _:

- T E X C H – H banned  
- L E V C H – invalid  
- P E S C H – invalid  
- F E S C H – invalid

That leaves only one plausible real word I can see:  
T E C H S – invalid (only 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s try K E P C S – invalid.

Another option: W E S C T – invalid.

Actually, scanning a mental word list, the only valid English 5-letter word fitting _ E _ C _ with no R/A/N/D/O/Y/H/M/I and letters available is:

B E L C H – H is banned (from H in HEMIC)  
F E L C H – same H issue  

Hold on, let me re-check H: feedback on HEMIC says H(-) meaning H is in the word but not in position 1 – so H is still allowed!  (Earlier I thought H was banned, but the dash means in word but elsewhere.)

So H can appear, just not in position 1.

Therefore _ E _ C _ with C in 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps reveal or eliminate many letters quickly.

Some good starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - all vowels except O)
- CRANE (common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are very common consonants with A, E)

I'll choose CRANE because it has:
1. C - common consonant
2. R - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common vowel

This combination should give good coverage to identify letters in the secret word.

- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- A(x): A is not in the word at all
- N(x): N is not in the word at all
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So we keep: C (but not in pos 1), E (but not in pos 5)
We eliminate: R, A, N

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C and E
- C is not in position 1, E is not in position 5
- Does not contain R, A, N at all

Looking for such a word... 
Good candidates:
- CHOSE: has C and E, C not pos 1, E not pos 5, no R/A/N
- CELLO: but E is pos 2, might be okay
- SCOOP: no E
- VOICE: V is less common, might be good

Best choice: CHOSE
- Letters: C, H, O, S, E
- C is position 2 (not 1) ✓
- E is position 5 - but feedback says E is not in position 5, so CHOSE is bad (E is pos 5)

Next option: VOICE
- V, O, I, C, E
- C is pos 4 ✓
- E is pos 5 ✗ (same problem)

Next: CELLO
- C, E, L, L, O
- C is pos 1 ✗ (can't be)
- E is pos 2 ✓

Next: SCONE

- Contains N which is eliminated ✗

Next: CLOSE
- C, L, O, S, E
- C is pos 1 ✗

Next: OCEAN - has A (eliminated) ✗

Next: COBEL - not a valid word

Next: DECOY
- D, E, C, O, Y
- Has E (pos 2) ✓
- Has C (pos 3) ✓
- No R/A/N ✓
- Valid word

DECOY looks good.

- Letters in the secret word and their statuses:
  – E: must be in position 2 (from Guess 2: E(✓))  
  – C: must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 1 (Guess 1) and NOT in position 3 (Guess 2) ⇒ possible positions: 2, 4, or 5
  – R, A, N, D, O, Y are all absent

So the word has the form:
_ E _ _ _
with C appearing once at position 2, 4 or 5; positions 1, 3, 5 (or whatever positions are left) must be filled with letters other than R, A, N, D, O, Y.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting:
- E is in position 2
- C must appear once (not in 1 or 3)
- No R, A, N, D, O, Y

Possible positions for C:
- Position 2: impossible (E is there)
- Position 4
- Position 5

Case 1: C in position 4
word skeleton: _ E _ C _

Case 2: C in position 5
word skeleton: _ E _ _ C

Now pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses other un-eliminated common letters.

Quick scan for real words:
Case 1 (_E_C_): BENCH? no (N eliminated). HEFCE? not valid.  
Case 2 (_E__C): BEBIC? not valid.  
Another candidate: FENCE? no (N).  
HEMIC? C would be pos 4, so H E M I C – all letters un-eliminated; valid word.

- C is in pos 5 (allowed) ✓
- No R, A, N, D, O, Y ✓

   ⇒ C must be at position 4.  
3. H, M, I, R, A, N, D, O, Y are all absent.

So the word skeleton is:
_ E _ C _

Letters still available (excluding the eliminated ones) include B, F, G, K, L, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  
We need to pick two different letters for positions 1 and 5 from these, forming a valid English word.

Real 5-letter words fitting _ E _ C _ with no banned letters:
- FENCE – N is banned  
- LEECH – H is banned  
- SIEGE – I, G are banned  
- BEECH – B, H are banned  
- BENCH – N, H are banned  
- BELCH – H is banned  
- PECKY – Y is banned  
- PERCH – R, H are banned  
- SPECK – S, K are fine, but word is 5 letters: S P E C K (fits)  
   – S is not banned  
   – P is not banned  
   – K is not banned  
   – Positions: S(1), P(2) conflicts with E, so SPECK is invalid (P would have to be in 2)  
- VEXED – X is allowed, but D is banned  
- … continuing search …

Another valid candidate: JEWEL – but J/E/W/E/L; J not banned, L not banned, but structure doesn’t match _E_C_.

Next candidate: PECKY – already disqualified (Y).  
Next: SPECK – positions: S(1), P(2)=E? no, conflicts.

Wait: must have E in position 2.

Look specifically for pattern _ E _ C _:
- B E L C H – H banned  
- B E N C H – N, H banned  
- V E X C H – H banned  
- T E X C H – H banned  
- L E V C H – invalid  
- P E S C H – invalid  
- F E S C H – invalid  
- G E S C H – invalid  

That leaves only one plausible real word I can see:  
T E C H S – invalid (only 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s try K E P C S – invalid.

Another option: W E S C T – invalid.

Actually, scanning a mental word list, the only valid English 5-letter word fitting _ E _ C _ with no R/A/N/D/O/Y/H/M/I and letters available is:

B E L C H – H is banned (from H in HEMIC)  
F E L C H – same H issue  

Hold on, let me re-check H: feedback on HEMIC says H(-) meaning H is in the word but not in position 1 – so H is still allowed!  (Earlier I thought H was banned, but the dash means in word but elsewhere.)

So H can appear, just not in position 1.

Therefore _ E _ C _ with C in 4.

Candidate: B E L C H  
– B, E, L, C, H  
– No banned letters (R, A, N, D, O, Y, M, I)  
– C is in position 4 ✓  
– E is in position 2 ✓  
– H can be in position 5 ✓  
– Valid word.

BELCH is the only remaining candidate that fits all constraints.

3. Position 4 = C (✓ from both BELCH and KETCH)
4. Position 5 = H (✓ from both BELCH and KETCH)

The only unknown letter is in position 1.  
Eliminated letters so far: R, A, N, D, O, Y, M, I, B, L, K.  
That severely limits the remaining alphabet.

Available letters for position 1 (among common English consonants):  
F, G, J, P, S, V, W, Z … etc.

We need a real 5-letter word of the form: _ E T C H.

The only valid English word I can think of is “FETCH”.

- F is still allowed (never appeared in any guess).  
- E, T, C, H are already confirmed in their exact spots.

So the word must be FETCH.
