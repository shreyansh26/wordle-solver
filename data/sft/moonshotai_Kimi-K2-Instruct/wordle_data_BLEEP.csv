This is the first guess in a Wordle-like game where we have to guess a secret 5-letter word. Since we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that has common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should cover as many common letters as possible without repeating letters. Two popular choices are ""STARE"" and ""CRANE"" because they contain common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very frequent letters in English words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-). That means E is in the word, but not at the 5th position.

Since we've now ruled out C, R, A, N entirely, and we know E is somewhere else, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses letters not yet tested (avoid C,R,A,N).
2. Includes E in a new position (positions 1-4).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- N and E were tested: N is out, E remains and will now be in position 4.
- This tests S, T, O while repositioning E.

Alternative could be ""STOLE"" but we've already excluded O, so better to test S,T,O,E in new positions. Another good option is ""STOLE"" but wait - O wasn't excluded yet. Actually, from CRANE we only excluded C,R,A,N. So S,T,O are new. ""STONE"" seems solid.

But let me verify: 
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E. N is already excluded, so this is bad. 
Better to pick a word with E in positions 1-4 and no C,R,A,N. 

Options:
- ELDER: has D,L which are common
- EMBED: has B,M,D

- LIGHT: has L,I,G,H,T - no E, so bad

- Letters definitely present: E, L.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses E and L,
- avoids all forbidden letters,
- places E in a new position (1, 3, or 4),
- tests new consonants (B, D, M, T, etc.).

- tests new consonants (B, D, M, T, etc.).

Candidate words:
- BLEED (but D repeats E pattern)  
- LEDGE (E in 4, L in 1, D/G new)  
- METEL (but T,E,L already placed)  
- DELVE (E in 4, D,V new)  
- GLEDE (E in 1&5, but 5 is known invalid for E)  
- BELLE (repeats L)  
- ELBOW (but O,W new)  
- DWELT (E in 3, D,W,T new)  

“DWELT” looks excellent:
- Letters: D, W, E, L, T – none forbidden.  
- E is now in position 3 (new slot).  
- L is in position 4 (new slot).  
- Tests three fresh consonants: D, W, T.

Let’s collect what we now know after three guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):
C, R, A, N, H, P, S, D, W, T.

Letters that definitely ARE in the word:
E – now known to be in position 3 (✓ in DWELT).

L – is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in HELPS and DWELT).  
Therefore L must be in position 1 or 5.

Positions fixed so far:
3 = E

Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 4, 5  
(only 5 is still possible for L).

So the pattern is:
[ _ , _ , E , _ , _ ]  
with L either at 1 or 5, and all other letters chosen from the remaining available alphabet:
B, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
(plus repeats of E or L only if needed, but can’t be).

We need a valid English 5-letter word that:
– has E in position 3,
– has L in position 1 or 5,
– uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s look for such words.

Case 1: L in position 1  
L _ E _ _

Example words:
L B E E F → “LBEEF” – not a common word.
L E E K S – invalid, E already in 3.
L I E G E – valid English word.

Case 2: L in position 5  
_ _ E _ L

Example words:
F E E L – invalid (only 4 letters).
B E E L – invalid.
M E E L – invalid.
G E E L – invalid.
B E G L – invalid.
G E M L – invalid.
B E S L – invalid.
F E M A L – invalid.

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “LIEGE”.

Check:
L I E G E
– E is in position 3 ✓
– L is in position 1 (allowed)
– All letters (L, I, E, G) are from allowed set.

Therefore, “LIEGE” is the best next guess.

A good starting word should cover as many common letters as possible without repeating letters. Two popular choices are ""STARE"" and ""CRANE"" because they contain common letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-). That means E is in the word, but not at the 5th position.

Since we've now ruled out C, R, A, N entirely, and we know E is somewhere else, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses letters not yet tested (avoid C,R,A,N).
2. Includes E in a new position (positions 1-4).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- N and E were tested: N is out, E remains and will now be in position 4.
- This tests S, T, O while repositioning E.

Alternative could be ""STOLE"" but we've already excluded O, so better to test S,T,O,E in new positions. Another good option is ""STOLE"" but wait - O wasn't excluded yet. Actually, from CRANE we only excluded C,R,A,N. So S,T,O are new. ""STONE"" seems solid.

But let me verify: 
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E. N is already excluded, so this is bad. 
Better to pick a word with E in positions 1-4 and no C,R,A,N. 

Options:
- ELDER: has D,L which are common
- EMBED: has B,M,D
- EARTH: has T,H but R is excluded
- LIGHT: has L,I,G,H,T - no E, so bad
- SLEPT: S,L,P,T - has E in 2nd position
- SMELT: S,M,E,L,T - good, E in 3rd position
- HELPS: H,E,L,P,S - E in 2nd position

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess in a Wordle-like game where we have to guess a secret 5-letter word. Since we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that has common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should cover as many common letters as possible without repeating letters. Two popular choices are ""STARE"" and ""CRANE"" because they contain common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very frequent letters in English words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-). That means E is in the word, but not at the 5th position.

Since we've now ruled out C, R, A, N entirely, and we know E is somewhere else, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses letters not yet tested (avoid C,R,A,N).
2. Includes E in a new position (positions 1-4).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters.
- N and E were tested: N is out, E remains and will now be in position 4.
- This tests S, T, O while repositioning E.

Alternative could be ""STOLE"" but we've already excluded O, so better to test S,T,O,E in new positions. Another good option is ""STOLE"" but wait - O wasn't excluded yet. Actually, from CRANE we only excluded C,R,A,N. So S,T,O are new. ""STONE"" seems solid.

But let me verify: 
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E. N is already excluded, so this is bad. 
Better to pick a word with E in positions 1-4 and no C,R,A,N. 

Options:
- ELDER: has D,L which are common
- EMBED: has B,M,D
- EARTH: has T,H but R is excluded
- LIGHT: has L,I,G,H,T - no E, so bad
- SLEPT: S,L,P,T - has E in 2nd position
- SMELT: S,M,E,L,T - good, E in 3rd position
- HELPS: H,E,L,P,S - E in 2nd position

""HELPS"" tests H,E,L,P,S and positions E in 2nd place. This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HELPS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) L(-) P(-) S(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   – C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.  
   – E is in the word, but **not** in position 5 (and, from CRANE, not in position 2 either).

2. HELPS → H(x) E(-) L(-) P(-) S(x)  
   – H, P, S are not in the word.  
   – E is again marked “wrong position” (it was in position 2), confirming it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
   – L is in the word but **not** in position 3.

So we know:
- Letters forbidden: C, R, A, N, H, P, S.  
- Letters definitely present: E, L.  
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4.  
- L cannot be in 3.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses E and L,
- avoids all forbidden letters,
- places E in a new position (1, 3, or 4),
- tests new consonants (B, D, M, T, etc.).

Candidate words:
- BLEED (but D repeats E pattern)  
- LEDGE (E in 4, L in 1, D/G new)  
- METEL (but T,E,L already placed)  
- DELVE (E in 4, D,V new)  
- GLEDE (E in 1&5, but 5 is known invalid for E)  
- BELLE (repeats L)  
- ELBOW (but O,W new)  
- DWELT (E in 3, D,W,T new)  

“DWELT” looks excellent:
- Letters: D, W, E, L, T – none forbidden.  
- E is now in position 3 (new slot).  
- L is in position 4 (new slot).  
- Tests three fresh consonants: D, W, T.

<guess>DWELT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HELPS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) L(-) P(-) S(x)
Guess 3: DWELT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) W(x) E(✓) L(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s collect what we now know after three guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):
C, R, A, N, H, P, S, D, W, T.

Letters that definitely ARE in the word:
E – now known to be in position 3 (✓ in DWELT).

L – is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in HELPS and DWELT).  
Therefore L must be in position 1 or 5.

Positions fixed so far:
3 = E

Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 4, 5  
(only 5 is still possible for L).

So the pattern is:
[ _ , _ , E , _ , _ ]  
with L either at 1 or 5, and all other letters chosen from the remaining available alphabet:
B, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
(plus repeats of E or L only if needed, but can’t be).

We need a valid English 5-letter word that:
– has E in position 3,
– has L in position 1 or 5,
– uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s look for such words.

Case 1: L in position 1  
L _ E _ _

Example words:
L B E E F → “LBEEF” – not a common word.
L E E K S – invalid, E already in 3.
L I E G E – valid English word.

Case 2: L in position 5  
_ _ E _ L

Example words:
F E E L – invalid (only 4 letters).
B E E L – invalid.
M E E L – invalid.
G E E L – invalid.
B E G L – invalid.
G E M L – invalid.
B E S L – invalid.
F E M A L – invalid.

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “LIEGE”.

Check:
L I E G E
– E is in position 3 ✓
– L is in position 1 (allowed)
– All letters (L, I, E, G) are from allowed set.

Therefore, “LIEGE” is the best next guess.

Summary of all deductions:

Forbidden letters (x at least once):
C, R, A, N, H, P, S, D, W, T, I, G, V  
Only remaining consonants: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: only E confirmed; O and U still possible.

Position facts:
- Pos 1: B is correct (✓ in BEVEL) → B _ _ _ _
- Pos 2: E is present but wrong place (-) → E cannot be here.
- Pos 3: E is correct (✓ in DWELT) → B _ E _ _
- Pos 4: E is correct (✓ in BEVEL) → B _ E E _
- Pos 5: L is present but wrong place (-) → L is in the word, but NOT at pos 5.

Therefore the only possible placement for L is position 2 (because 1,3,4,5 are already fixed or excluded).

Word pattern: B L E E _

Only letter left for position 5 from the allowed set: F, J, K, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z  
Looking for English 5-letter words “BLEE?”:

- BLEED – D is forbidden.  
- BLEEP – P is forbidden.  
- BLEET – T is forbidden.  
- BLEEZ, BLEEX, BLEEJ, BLEEF – only BLEEF is a recognized word (meaning a rounded metal plate, esp. in armor).

Hence the unique guess that fits every constraint is BLEEF.
