Since this is my first guess and I have no prior feedback to work from, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The optimal strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency letters in positions where they're likely to appear.

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in almost all positions of 5-letter words
3. It has no repeating letters, which maximizes information gain
4. It's a valid English word

Other strong alternatives would be ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""RAISE"" is slightly better due to the combination of high-frequency letters it contains.

I will proceed with RAISE as my first guess to get the most informative feedback possible.

Current feedback tells us:

- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but NOT in the last position (-).

So the secret word
- contains E somewhere other than position 5 (i.e., positions 1-4).
- does NOT contain R, A, I, S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The optimal strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency letters in positions where they're likely to appear.

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in almost all positions of 5-letter words
3. It has no repeating letters, which maximizes information gain
4. It's a valid English word

Other strong alternatives would be ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""RAISE"" is slightly better due to the combination of high-frequency letters it contains.

I will proceed with RAISE as my first guess to get the most informative feedback possible.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current feedback tells us:

- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but NOT in the last position (-).

So the secret word
- contains E somewhere other than position 5 (i.e., positions 1-4).
- does NOT contain R, A, I, S.

High-frequency letters still available: E, T, O, N, L, C, U, D, B, G, M, P, H, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that uses E in one of the first four spots and avoids R, A, I, S. A good “second-guess” choice is “MOTEL”:
- It places E in position 4 (valid location).  
- Uses other common letters: M, O, T, L.  
- Contains no banned letters R, A, I, S.

Other viable options: “COBEL”, “DONUT”, “LYNCH”, but “MOTEL” is straightforward and common.

Letter that IS in the correct position: E in position 4  
Letter that IS in the word but in the wrong position: L (so L appears, but not in position 5)

Word template so far: _ _ _ E _  (with L somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known L.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep an L in a NEW position (to test where L belongs)  
2. Fill the three unknown slots with new high-frequency letters not yet eliminated  
3. Keep E anchored in position 4

Candidate words that fit:
- CLEFT (C L E F T) – T is already ruled out  
- LUCKE (L U C K E) – E must be 4th, so this is invalid  
- PELVE (P E L V E) – E would repeat, invalid  
- BLEEP – LL, EE repeats, invalid  
- BLEND – T fits structure _ L _ E _ and uses fresh letters (B, N, D)

B, N, D have not appeared yet and are common.  
Place L in position 2, B in 1, N in 3, D in 5:

BLEND → positions: B L N E D  
Check:  
– No banned letters (R,A,I,S,M,O,T)  
– E is in the correct 4th spot ✓  
– L is tested in position 2 (it was previously “wrong position” in 5, so this is a valid test)  
– Remaining letters B, N, D are new.

Therefore BLEND is a strong next guess.

Actually, P was never used in any guess, so it’s still allowed.  
BLEEP is recognized (meaning a high-pitched sound). It uses P in position 5 which hasn’t been tested.  

- BLECK – already tried; C was ruled out.  
- BLEWZ – not a word.  
- BLEXY – not a word.  

The only remaining valid English word that fits BL_E_ with allowed letters is:

Real word checklist:

Looking up BL _ E _ words excluding already excluded letters:

- BLUFF – has F and F, but position 4 must be E, so no.  
- BLYPE – obsolete, but recognized.  

BLYPE is archaic but listed in dictionaries. It uses Y and P, neither of which have been ruled out.  

Another possibility: BLEEP (already noted).  

Between BLEEP (double E) and BLYPE (Y and P), BLYPE avoids the double-E issue and uses new letters.  

The more likely everyday word, however, is BLEEP, even with the double E. Since English spelling allows it and position 4 is locked to a single E, BLEEP is acceptable.

But the feedback confirms only one E in position 4. Therefore BLEEP would imply E in position 3 is not the same instance. We must ensure each letter instance is considered individually.

Upon reflection, the only remaining simple word that fits is:

It uses Y in position 3 and P in position 5, both never tested before, and it’s in the dictionary.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BLEEP,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is my first guess and I have no prior feedback to work from, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The optimal strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency letters in positions where they're likely to appear.

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in almost all positions of 5-letter words
3. It has no repeating letters, which maximizes information gain
4. It's a valid English word

Other strong alternatives would be ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""RAISE"" is slightly better due to the combination of high-frequency letters it contains.

I will proceed with RAISE as my first guess to get the most informative feedback possible.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current feedback tells us:

- R, A, I, S are NOT in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but NOT in the last position (-).

So the secret word
- contains E somewhere other than position 5 (i.e., positions 1-4).
- does NOT contain R, A, I, S.

High-frequency letters still available: E, T, O, N, L, C, U, D, B, G, M, P, H, Y, K, etc.

I want a word that uses E in one of the first four spots and avoids R, A, I, S. A good “second-guess” choice is “MOTEL”:
- It places E in position 4 (valid location).  
- Uses other common letters: M, O, T, L.  
- Contains no banned letters R, A, I, S.

Other viable options: “COBEL”, “DONUT”, “LYNCH”, but “MOTEL” is straightforward and common.

Guess 2: MOTEL -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) T(x) E(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all: R, A, I, S, M, O, T  
Letter that IS in the correct position: E in position 4  
Letter that IS in the word but in the wrong position: L (so L appears, but not in position 5)

Word template so far: _ _ _ E _  (with L somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known L.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep an L in a NEW position (to test where L belongs)  
2. Fill the three unknown slots with new high-frequency letters not yet eliminated  
3. Keep E anchored in position 4

Candidate words that fit:
- CLEFT (C L E F T) – T is already ruled out  
- LUCKE (L U C K E) – E must be 4th, so this is invalid  
- PELVE (P E L V E) – E would repeat, invalid  
- BLEEP – LL, EE repeats, invalid  
- BLEND – T fits structure _ L _ E _ and uses fresh letters (B, N, D)

B, N, D have not appeared yet and are common.  
Place L in position 2, B in 1, N in 3, D in 5:

BLEND → positions: B L N E D  
Check:  
– No banned letters (R,A,I,S,M,O,T)  
– E is in the correct 4th spot ✓  
– L is tested in position 2 (it was previously “wrong position” in 5, so this is a valid test)  
– Remaining letters B, N, D are new.

Therefore BLEND is a strong next guess.

  - Position 2: L (✓)
  - Position 4: E (✓)

  - R, A, I, S, M, O, T, N, D

- Letters not yet tested in any position:
  - C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding any already ruled out)

- Word structure: B L _ E _

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. The remaining letters that haven't been used or eliminated are: C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English letters among these: C, F, G, H, K, P, U, Y.

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 5:
- Position 3: C, F, G, H, K, P, U, Y
- Position 5: C, F, G, H, K, P, U, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit BL_E_:
- B L _ E _

Possible words:
- BLEAK (valid word, uses B, L, E, A, K) – but A is already ruled out (x in guess 1)
- BLECH (B, L, E, C, H)
- BLEED – but D is ruled out
- BLEEP – P is in position 5, but E repeats (position 4 already has E)
- BLUER – R is ruled out
- BLUES – S is ruled out
- BLEST – S is ruled out
- BLEEP – valid, but has two E's which is allowed but we already have E in position 4
- BLECH – uses C and H which are new
- BLECK – K is valid
- BLEDY – not a valid word
- BLEWY – Y is valid
- BLECH seems like a valid English word (used as slang for ""disgust"") and uses new letters C and H in positions 3 and 5.

Alternative check:
- BLECH: B(✓), L(✓), E(✓), C(new), H(new) → fits all constraints
- Another option: BLEEP – but has double E which is acceptable but doesn't add as much new info since E is already confirmed in position 4

BLECH is the better choice as it introduces two new letters (C and H) without any conflicts.

Current constraints after the five guesses:

1. Fixed positions:
   - B at 1
   - L at 2
   - E at 4

2. Letters that have been marked with an ✗ (are NOT in the word at all):
   R, A, I, S, M, O, T, N, D, C, H, Y

3. Letters that have been marked with an – (are in the word but NOT in that position):
   - E was originally a – (not in position 5), but is now locked in position 4 ✓  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 5

4. Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out anywhere):
   F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

5. Word pattern: B L _ E _
   - Position 3: must be one of F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
   - Position 5: must be P (because P is in the word and the only – restriction is “not in 5”, but 5 is the only remaining spot where P can go—wait, let’s re-read feedback).

   Actually, in Guess 5: BLYPE → P(-) in position 5.  
   “P(-)” means P is in the word but NOT in position 5. Therefore P must appear somewhere else (positions 1,2,3,4).  
   But positions 1,2,4 are already taken by B, L, E respectively.  
   Therefore P must be in position 3.

Hence the word is B L P E _.

The only empty slot is position 5.  
Letters still allowed: F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
