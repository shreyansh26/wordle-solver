For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Research shows that the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (C, R, N), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So for the next guess I want:
1. To include A, but not in the 3rd spot.
2. To avoid C, R, N, E entirely.
3. To use other common letters not yet tried: T, S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit these constraints and contain a good mix of new letters:
- STAND – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, D
- PLAIN – includes A (not in 3rd), plus P, L, I, N (but N is eliminated)
- STAMP – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, M, P
- ADMIT – has A in 1st, plus D, M, I, T

2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.

Breaking down the feedback so far:

Letters certainly NOT in the word:  
C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T, H, U  

Letters whose status we now know:
- A is in the word and sits in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in HAULS).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (- at position 4 in HAULS).
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (- at position 5 in HAULS).

Therefore the secret word has:
- A in position 2.
- Contains L and S somewhere, but:
  – L cannot be in position 4.
  – S cannot be in position 5.

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but position 2 is A).

Allowed letters so far: any of the remaining ones not yet ruled out:
B, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A, L, S (already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains L and S in some of positions 1, 3, 4 (but L not in 4, S not in 5).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try to build such a word:

Example candidates:
- B A S L Y → fits position rules: A (2), L (4) but L must not be in 4 – discard.
- S A L V O → A(2), L(3), S(1) – all constraints satisfied, all letters allowed.
- G A S L Y → A(2), S(3), L(4) – again L in 4 forbidden – discard.
- F A S L Y → same issue.
- P A S L Y → same issue.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sally,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Research shows that the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (C, R, N), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So for the next guess I want:
1. To include A, but not in the 3rd spot.
2. To avoid C, R, N, E entirely.
3. To use other common letters not yet tried: T, S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit these constraints and contain a good mix of new letters:
- STAND – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, D
- PLAIN – includes A (not in 3rd), plus P, L, I, N (but N is eliminated)
- STAMP – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, M, P
- ADMIT – has A in 1st, plus D, M, I, T

ADMIT seems good: A is in 1st (so not 3rd), and uses D, M, I, T which are all new letters.

1. Letters certainly NOT in the word (x’s so far): C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.

So for the third guess I must:
- include A, but keep it out of positions 1 and 3.
- avoid every letter already ruled out (C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T).
- use only remaining common letters: S, L, K, H, U, O, Y, B, G, F, P, V, W, Z, Q, X (plus a few rarer ones).

Since A must appear and can’t be in spot 1 or 3, the only possibilities for A are positions 2, 4, or 5.

Good candidate words meeting these constraints:
- BALMY – uses B, L, M, Y; but M is already excluded.
- GALAX – uses G, L, X; X is rare, maybe not ideal.
- SALVO – uses S, L, V, O.  All letters are still allowed and common enough.
- FOALS – uses F, O, L, S.  Same idea, but A is in position 3 (forbidden).
- HAULS – uses H, U, L, S.  A is in position 2 (allowed).

Let’s go with HAULS:  
– A is in position 2 (safe, not 1 or 3).  
– Letters H, U, L, S have not been tried yet.  
– All are reasonably common.

However, S is already in position 1 and can appear again. But SALSA has A in position 4 which is allowed. But N is eliminated, so SALSA is possible?

Looking for 5-letter words in English starting with SAL:

   - S: ✓ in position 1, no info against S in other positions  
   - A: ✓ in position 2, no info against A elsewhere  
   - L: ✓ in position 3

- SALTY – invalid (T eliminated)  
- SALSA – S,A,L,S,A – but we have no info against double letters. Let's check feedback on letters:  
   - S: ✓ in position 1, no info against S in other positions  
   - A: ✓ in position 2, no info against A elsewhere  
   - L: ✓ in position 3  
   - S: allowed  
   - A: allowed  

Given that, SALSA seems to fit all constraints perfectly.

But let's verify the letters:
- S: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- L: ✓ (position 3)
- S: allowed (not eliminated)
- A: allowed (not eliminated)

No conflicts with previous feedback. Therefore SALSA is a valid guess.Based on the confirmed positions S A L _ _ and the remaining valid letters, the word appears to be ""SALSA"".",Guess 5: SALSA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,sally,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Research shows that the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (C, R, N), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So for the next guess I want:
1. To include A, but not in the 3rd spot.
2. To avoid C, R, N, E entirely.
3. To use other common letters not yet tried: T, S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit these constraints and contain a good mix of new letters:
- STAND – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, D
- PLAIN – includes A (not in 3rd), plus P, L, I, N (but N is eliminated)
- STAMP – includes A (not in 3rd), plus S, T, M, P
- ADMIT – has A in 1st, plus D, M, I, T

ADMIT seems good: A is in 1st (so not 3rd), and uses D, M, I, T which are all new letters.

<guess>ADMIT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters certainly NOT in the word (x’s so far): C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.

So for the third guess I must:
- include A, but keep it out of positions 1 and 3.
- avoid every letter already ruled out (C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T).
- use only remaining common letters: S, L, K, H, U, O, Y, B, G, F, P, V, W, Z, Q, X (plus a few rarer ones).

Since A must appear and can’t be in spot 1 or 3, the only possibilities for A are positions 2, 4, or 5.

Good candidate words meeting these constraints:
- BALMY – uses B, L, M, Y; but M is already excluded.
- GALAX – uses G, L, X; X is rare, maybe not ideal.
- SALVO – uses S, L, V, O.  All letters are still allowed and common enough.
- FOALS – uses F, O, L, S.  Same idea, but A is in position 3 (forbidden).
- HAULS – uses H, U, L, S.  A is in position 2 (allowed).

Let’s go with HAULS:  
– A is in position 2 (safe, not 1 or 3).  
– Letters H, U, L, S have not been tried yet.  
– All are reasonably common.

<guess>HAULS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: HAULS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) U(x) L(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Breaking down the feedback so far:

Letters certainly NOT in the word:  
C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T, H, U  

Letters whose status we now know:
- A is in the word and sits in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in HAULS).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (- at position 4 in HAULS).
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (- at position 5 in HAULS).

Therefore the secret word has:
- A in position 2.
- Contains L and S somewhere, but:
  – L cannot be in position 4.
  – S cannot be in position 5.

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but position 2 is A).

Allowed letters so far: any of the remaining ones not yet ruled out:
B, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A, L, S (already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains L and S in some of positions 1, 3, 4 (but L not in 4, S not in 5).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try to build such a word:

Example candidates:
- B A S L Y → fits position rules: A (2), L (4) but L must not be in 4 – discard.
- S A L V O → A(2), L(3), S(1) – all constraints satisfied, all letters allowed.
- G A S L Y → A(2), S(3), L(4) – again L in 4 forbidden – discard.
- F A S L Y → same issue.
- P A S L Y → same issue.

SALVO looks solid and uses common remaining letters.

Let’s test SALVO.

<guess>SALVO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: HAULS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) U(x) L(✓) S(-)
Guess 4: SALVO -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) V(x) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:

1. Position 1: S (✓ in SALVO)
2. Position 2: A (✓ in both HAULS and SALVO)
3. Position 3: L (✓ in SALVO)
4. Position 4: NOT V or O (both x)
5. Position 5: NOT O (x)

Letters already eliminated:
C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T, H, U, V, O

So far we know the word looks like: S A L _ _

Remaining available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

From the prior feedback:
- S is in position 1 (✓)  
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
- L is in position 3 (✓)  

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These letters must be from the remaining pool and should form a valid 5-letter word when placed after ""SAL"".

Using the remaining letters (B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z), we need to find combinations that form valid words. Let's consider:

- SALTY (Y is available, T is already eliminated) – but T is out.  
- SALPY – not a valid word.  
- SALGW – not valid.  
- SALKY – not a standard word.  
- SALFY – not a word.  
- SALBY – not a word.  

Actually, looking again at remaining letters, we have:

Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with ""SAL"":

- SALTY – T is eliminated (from ADMIT feedback: T is x) → invalid  
- SALSA – S already in position 1, can't repeat S? (no info against repeats) but A is already in position 2 → can't have two A's?  
Wait, we have no info against repeating letters. But SALSA has A in position 4 which is allowed (A was only excluded from position 3 in CRANE, and is now confirmed in position 2). However, S is already in position 1 and can appear again. But SALSA has A in position 4 which is allowed. But N is eliminated, so SALSA is possible? Wait S is in position 1, A in 2, L in 3, S in 4, A in 5.

But the word must be 5 letters, and we have S A L _ _ with positions 4 and 5 to fill from B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words in English starting with SAL:

- SALTY – invalid (T eliminated)  
- SALSA – S,A,L,S,A – but we have no info against double letters. Let's check feedback on letters:  
   - S: ✓ in position 1, no info against S in other positions  
   - A: ✓ in position 2, no info against A elsewhere  
   - L: ✓ in position 3  
   - S: allowed  
   - A: allowed  

Given that, SALSA seems to fit all constraints perfectly.

But let's verify the letters:
- S: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- L: ✓ (position 3)
- S: allowed (not eliminated)
- A: allowed (not eliminated)

No conflicts with previous feedback. Therefore SALSA is a valid guess.Based on the confirmed positions S A L _ _ and the remaining valid letters, the word appears to be ""SALSA"".

Current state:
1. Positions 1-3 are fixed: S A L _ _
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, N, E, D, M, I, T, H, U, V, O
3. Letters still allowed: remaining letters that have not yet been ruled out:  
   B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

4. From the feedback on SALSA:
   - S (position 4) is in the word but NOT in that position (-)
   - A (position 5) is in the word but NOT in that position (-)

So:
- S must appear somewhere else: possible positions 3 (already L), 2 (A), or 5 (x). So S must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is marked - (wrong position), and position 5 is marked - (wrong position). This is a contradiction unless there's a second S elsewhere.

Wait, re-reading the feedback:
- SALSA feedback: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-)
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 2: A ✓
   - Position 3: L ✓
   - Position 4: S - (S is in the word but not in position 4)
   - Position 5: A - (A is in the word but not in position 5)

This tells us:
- The word has S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3
- There is another S somewhere (not position 4) – but position 1 already has S, and position 5 can't have S because we have no info that S is in position 5.
- There is another A somewhere (not position 5) – but position 2 already has A.

This implies the word must have at least two S's and two A's, but in 5 letters with positions 1-3 fixed as S A L, this is impossible.

Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. Looking back:

Actually, the feedback symbols:
- ✓ means correct position
- - means letter in word but wrong position
- x means not in word

Thus, for SALSA:
- S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-) means:
   - S in position 1 is correct
   - A in position 2 is correct
   - L in position 3 is correct
   - The second S exists somewhere else (position 5), but is not in position 4
   - The second A exists somewhere else (position 4), but is not in position 5

This implies the word structure is S A L A S, where:
- Position 4 is A (since A must be in word but not position 5)
- Position 5 is S (since S must be in word but not position 4)

But we need to check if this is valid given previous constraints:
- S is allowed in position 5 (no info against it)
- A is allowed in position 4 (no info against it)
- All other letters are covered by the fixed positions

Thus the word must be SALAS. However, is SALAS a valid 5-letter word? Checking dictionary: ""salas"" is a valid word (Spanish for ""rooms"", but also appears as an English surname). Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible arrangement.

Therefore, the correct word is SALAS.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the only arrangement left that satisfies all constraints is:

1. Positions 1-3 are fixed: S A L _ _

3. Letters still allowed: remaining letters that have not yet been ruled out:

4. From the feedback on SALSA:
   - S (position 4) is in the word but NOT in that position (-)
   - A (position 5) is in the word but NOT in that position (-)

So:
- S must appear somewhere else: possible positions 3 (already L), 2 (A), or 5 (x). So S must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is marked - (wrong position), and position 5 is marked - (wrong position). This is a contradiction unless there's a second S elsewhere.

   - Position 2: A ✓
   - Position 3: L ✓
   - Position 4: S - (S is in the word but not in position 4)
   - Position 5: A - (A is in the word but not in position 5)

This tells us:
- The word has S in position 1, A in 2, L in 3
- There is another S somewhere (not position 4) – but position 1 already has S, and position 5 can't have S because we have no info that S is in position 5.
- There is another A somewhere (not position 5) – but position 2 already has A.

This implies the word must have at least two S's and two A's, but in 5 letters with positions 1-3 fixed as S A L, this is impossible.

Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. Looking back:

Actually, the feedback symbols:
- ✓ means correct position
- - means letter in word but wrong position
- x means not in word

Thus, for SALSA:
- S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(-) A(-) means:
   - S in position 1 is correct
   - A in position 2 is correct
   - L in position 3 is correct
   - The second S exists somewhere else (position 5), but is not in position 4
   - The second A exists somewhere else (position 4), but is not in position 5

This implies the word structure is S A L A S, where:
- Position 4 is A (since A must be in word but not position 5)
- Position 5 is S (since S must be in word but not position 4)

But we need to check if this is valid given previous constraints:
- S is allowed in position 5 (no info against it)
- A is allowed in position 4 (no info against it)
- All other letters are covered by the fixed positions

Thus the word must be SALAS. However, is SALAS a valid 5-letter word? Checking dictionary: ""salas"" is a valid word (Spanish for ""rooms"", but also appears as an English surname). Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible arrangement.

Therefore, the correct word is SALAS.Based on the feedback, the only arrangement left that satisfies all constraints is:",Guess 6: SALAS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(-) S(-),FAIL
