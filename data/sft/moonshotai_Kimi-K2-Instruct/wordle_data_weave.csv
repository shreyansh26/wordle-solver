For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers many frequently used letters and should give good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let’s digest the new information from Guess 2 (EAGER):

Positions:
1 E(–)  → E is in the word, NOT here
2 A(–) → A is in the word, NOT here  (but we know from Guess 1 that A is in position 3, so this is redundant)
3 G(x) → G not in the word
4 E(–) → another E occurrence, still wrong position
5 R(x) → R not in the word

Summary so far:
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, G, R
- Letters we now know ARE in the word: A (fixed at position 3) and E (must appear at least once, positions 1,2,4,5 excluded)
- So E must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5, but the feedback implies it’s NOT in positions 1,2,4,5? Actually the feedback simply says “E is in the word but not in those exact positions,” so E could still be in any remaining spot—but we already have A fixed at 3.

Wait—more importantly, the double E in EAGER gave us two “E in wrong position” results, confirming the word has at least one E, but we still don’t know how many.

Next guess should:
- keep A at position 3
- try E in one of the remaining positions (1,2,4,5)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,weave,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers many frequently used letters and should give good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (marked x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (must be position 1, 2, 4, or 5).

So:
- Pos 3 must be A.
- The word does NOT contain: S, L, T.
- It DOES contain E, but E is not in position 5.
- No info yet on R, I, N, O, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Include E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4).
3. Use other common letters not yet tested (like R, I, N, O, etc.).

Possible candidates: EAGER, OCEAN, BREAD, GREASE, PLEAD, etc.
But PLEAD has L (already excluded), GREASE has S (excluded), OCEAN has N (not tested yet), etc.

EAGER:
- E at position 1 (valid, not position 5)
- A at position 3 (correct)
- G, E, R are new letters (E is already known, G and R are new)

Let's try EAGER.

<guess>EAGER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: EAGER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) G(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new information from Guess 2 (EAGER):

Positions:
1 E(–)  → E is in the word, NOT here
2 A(–) → A is in the word, NOT here  (but we know from Guess 1 that A is in position 3, so this is redundant)
3 G(x) → G not in the word
4 E(–) → another E occurrence, still wrong position
5 R(x) → R not in the word

Summary so far:
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, G, R
- Letters we now know ARE in the word: A (fixed at position 3) and E (must appear at least once, positions 1,2,4,5 excluded)
- So E must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5, but the feedback implies it’s NOT in positions 1,2,4,5? Actually the feedback simply says “E is in the word but not in those exact positions,” so E could still be in any remaining spot—but we already have A fixed at 3.

Wait—more importantly, the double E in EAGER gave us two “E in wrong position” results, confirming the word has at least one E, but we still don’t know how many.

Next guess should:
- keep A at position 3
- try E in one of the remaining positions (1,2,4,5)
- introduce new common consonants not yet tested (N, D, C, H, M, etc.)
- avoid S, L, T, G, R

Possible patterns: _ _ A _ _ with E somewhere.

I will try “BEACH”.
- B, E, A, C, H
- A is in position 3 (good)
- E is in position 2 (new spot, allowed)
- B, C, H are new letters and haven’t been ruled out
- Doesn’t use any of the excluded letters: S,L,T,G,R

Another candidate: “DEAIR” – D, E, A, I, R – but R is excluded.

Another: “KEAKI” – K, E, A, K, I – valid but obscure.

Given the constraints and needing a valid word, the best remaining choice is:

“PEAZE” – it uses P, E, A, Z, E where:
- E in position 2 ✓

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers many frequently used letters and should give good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (marked x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (must be position 1, 2, 4, or 5).

So:
- Pos 3 must be A.
- The word does NOT contain: S, L, T.
- It DOES contain E, but E is not in position 5.
- No info yet on R, I, N, O, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Include E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4).
3. Use other common letters not yet tested (like R, I, N, O, etc.).

Possible candidates: EAGER, OCEAN, BREAD, GREASE, PLEAD, etc.
But PLEAD has L (already excluded), GREASE has S (excluded), OCEAN has N (not tested yet), etc.

EAGER:
- E at position 1 (valid, not position 5)
- A at position 3 (correct)
- G, E, R are new letters (E is already known, G and R are new)

Let's try EAGER.

<guess>EAGER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: EAGER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) G(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new information from Guess 2 (EAGER):

Positions:
1 E(–)  → E is in the word, NOT here
2 A(–) → A is in the word, NOT here  (but we know from Guess 1 that A is in position 3, so this is redundant)
3 G(x) → G not in the word
4 E(–) → another E occurrence, still wrong position
5 R(x) → R not in the word

Summary so far:
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, G, R
- Letters we now know ARE in the word: A (fixed at position 3) and E (must appear at least once, positions 1,2,4,5 excluded)
- So E must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5, but the feedback implies it’s NOT in positions 1,2,4,5? Actually the feedback simply says “E is in the word but not in those exact positions,” so E could still be in any remaining spot—but we already have A fixed at 3.

Wait—more importantly, the double E in EAGER gave us two “E in wrong position” results, confirming the word has at least one E, but we still don’t know how many.

Next guess should:
- keep A at position 3
- try E in one of the remaining positions (1,2,4,5)
- introduce new common consonants not yet tested (N, D, C, H, M, etc.)
- avoid S, L, T, G, R

Possible patterns: _ _ A _ _ with E somewhere.

I will try “BEACH”.
- B, E, A, C, H
- A is in position 3 (good)
- E is in position 2 (new spot, allowed)
- B, C, H are new letters and haven’t been ruled out
- Doesn’t use any of the excluded letters: S,L,T,G,R

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

Known positions:
- 3rd letter = A ✓  
- 2nd letter = E ✓

Known letters:
- Must contain A (fixed at 3) and E (fixed at 2).
- Must NOT contain: S, L, T, G, R, B, C, H.

Still-allowed common letters (besides A and E): D, F, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word that fits: _ E A _ _ , using only allowed letters.

Some candidates:
- DEANS, FEARS → both include S or R (excluded)
- LEANS → L excluded
- MEANS → M, E, A, N, S (S excluded)
- PEAKS → K and S, but S is out
- WEARY → W, E, A, R, Y (R out)

The cleanest valid candidate with only allowed letters is:
MEAND → but “meand” isn’t in typical 5-letter word lists.

Next clean real word: “PEAVY” (P, E, A, V, Y) but “V” and “Y” are unusual.

A better dictionary word: “PEAKY” (P, E, A, K, Y) – K and Y are still allowed.

But let’s pick one that uses more common letters: “MEANT” (M, E, A, N, T).  
However T is excluded.

“PEANS” has S excluded.

“PEAKY” is valid: P, E, A, K, Y (none excluded).

But even safer: “FLEAD” is invalid (L, D not allowed).

Wait – simplest real word that fits _ E A _ _ and uses allowed letters: “FLEAM” uses L, M, etc.

Actually the only straightforward, common word left is “PEAKY”.

But let’s think of another: “VENAE” is obscure.

Another good one: “MEANS” has S excluded.

Another: “PEAKY” is dictionary, but maybe “MEANY”.

Actually the cleanest dictionary word that fits the constraints is:

DEANS – but S excluded.

Wait, common word that fits: “PEANS” – S excluded.

Let’s list all valid _ E A _ _ words avoiding S, L, T, G, R, B, C, H:

Possible patterns:
1. D E A N ?
2. F E A R ? → R excluded
3. N E A R ? → R excluded
4. P E A K ?
5. V E A L ? → L excluded

Only viable common word left: PEAKY – let’s use that.

But “PEAKY” may not be common. Another:

DEALT – L, T excluded.

Actually the simplest valid word fitting _ E A _ _ with allowed letters: “PEAKY”.

But let’s double-check for another candidate: “MEANY” (M, E, A, N, Y) – valid.

Both “MEANY” and “PEAKY” fit. Between them, “MEANY” uses more common letters (M, N, Y).

We’ll go with MEANY.

Another: “KEAKI” – K, E, A, K, I – valid but obscure.

Given the constraints and needing a valid word, the best remaining choice is:

“PEAZE” – it uses P, E, A, Z, E where:
- E in position 2 ✓  
- A in position 3 ✓  
- letters used: P, E, A, Z, E – none are in the excluded list.

Therefore, next guess is PEAZE.
