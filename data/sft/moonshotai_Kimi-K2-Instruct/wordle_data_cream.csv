- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to maximize the information gained. The optimal strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good starting word should use several of these letters while being a valid word. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has been shown to be effective in narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but wrong position (–)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (–)

We now know:
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T
- Present letters: A, E (both must appear in other positions)

I want a new word that:
1. Contains both A and E in different positions from SLATE (so A≠3, E≠5).
2. Uses new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoids the eliminated letters S, L, T.

Common untested letters include R, O, N, I, C, D, U, M, P. A good word would use A and E plus these. Possible candidates:
- CRANE (but we can't use R in position 1 and A in 3 is invalid)
- OCEAN (but E is in position 5 which is invalid per feedback)
- MEDIA (but A is in position 5 which is invalid)
- CREAM (A in 4, E in 2) - this looks promising as it uses C, R, M and places A and E in new positions.

Let me verify CREAM:
- C: new letter
- R: new letter
- E: in position 2 (was position 5 in SLATE, so valid)
- A: in position 4 (was position 3 in SLATE, so valid)
- M: new letter
This satisfies all constraints.
