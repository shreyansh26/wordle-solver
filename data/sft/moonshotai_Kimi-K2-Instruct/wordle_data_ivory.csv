This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers different positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters.

Some good first-word candidates include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers all major vowels)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters
2. C and R are high-frequency consonants
3. A and E are the two most common vowels
4. N is a common consonant in English words
5. The combination gives good coverage across positions (C-1, R-2, A-3, N-4, E-5)

This should provide maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

- The word contains the letter R, but R is NOT in position 2.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, or E.

Since E is out, we need another vowel. The remaining most common vowels are I, O, and U. Among consonants, let’s look for other common letters that haven’t been tested: S, T, L, M, D, P, etc.

A new guess should:
1. Include the known letter R in a different position (not 2)
2. Avoid C, A, N, E
3. Introduce new common letters to maximize information

Good candidates:
- STORM: tests S, T, O, R, M (but O is in position 3 and R in 4)
- TRULS: but TRULS isn’t a word
- STRIP: tests S, T, R, I, P (but R is in position 3, which is allowed since we only know R is not in position 2)
- MORAL: but A is already out
- DRIFT: tests D, R, I, F, T (R in position 2 is forbidden, but here R is in position 2 - bad)

Let me pick STORM:
- S, T, O, R, M: all new letters except R (which we know is in the word)
- R is in position 4 (not 2, so allowed)
- Tests new vowel O and consonants S, T, M

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

Round 1 – CRANE  
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
→ R is in the word but NOT in position 2, and none of C, A, N, E are in the word.

Round 2 – STORM  
S(x) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)  
→ Letter O is correct in position 3, letter R is correct in position 4.  
→ S, T, M are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O R _ (3rd = O, 4th = R)
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, M
- R is already placed at position 4, so it cannot appear anywhere else.

We now need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are still allowed.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Common remaining vowels (since A and E are out): I, U.

Let’s look for a five-letter word that fits _ _ O R _ and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- FLOOR (but F, L, O, O, R – two O’s might be ok) – yet L is allowed, but double O? We don’t know yet.  
- CHOIR – C and H are allowed, but C is forbidden.  
- GLORY – G, L allowed, fits pattern G L O R _.  
- VIGOR – V, I, G allowed, but second O is ok.  
- HUMOR – H, U, M, O, R – but M is forbidden.  
- POKER – P, O, K, E, R – but E is forbidden.  
- FLORA – A forbidden.  
- GLOOR – not a valid word.

Best fit: GLORY – G, L, O, R, Y.  
Letters used: G, L, O, R, Y.  
- G and L and Y have not been tested yet and are not in the forbidden set.  
- Fits the pattern _ _ O R _ with O in 3 and R in 4.  
- R is only in position 4, which matches its confirmed placement.

Therefore, I will guess GLORY.

From the three previous guesses we now know:

Pattern so far: _ _ O R Y  
(position 3 = O, position 4 = R, position 5 = Y)

Forbidden letters (never appear anywhere in the word):
C, A, N, E, S, T, M, G, L

Still-available letters (that have not yet been ruled out):
- Vowels: I, U  (A and E already excluded)
- Consonants: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, plus possibly others not yet ruled out

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters from the allowed set, producing a valid 5-letter English word that ends in “_ _ O R Y”.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ O R Y:
- DOURY – but “doury” is not a common word
- FURRY – F, U, R, R, Y → second R would be invalid because R is already fixed at position 4 and cannot repeat elsewhere
- VIGOR – already seen; it conflicts with our pattern
- BORNY – not a valid word
- HURRY – H, U, R, R, Y → again two R’s, invalid
- POKER – E is forbidden
- PIVOT – pattern doesn’t match
- PARRY – two R’s again
- BURRY – two R’s
- DOWRY – D, O, W, R, Y → pattern _ O W R Y doesn’t fit our fixed positions
- IVORY – I, V, O, R, Y → exactly I _ O R Y with the first letter I and second letter V

Word: IVORY
Letters: I (pos 1), V (pos 2), O (pos 3), R (pos 4), Y (pos 5).
- All letters are allowed (none of the forbidden ones).
- Pattern matches: _ _ O R Y
- It’s a valid English word.

Therefore, IVORY is the logical next guess.
