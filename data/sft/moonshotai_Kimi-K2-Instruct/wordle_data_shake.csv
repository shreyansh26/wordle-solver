For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Good starting words often have vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English five-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the fifth position.

So the word:
- Contains E in position 5.
- Contains A somewhere except position 1.
- Contains S somewhere except position 4.
- Does NOT contain R or O.
- We still have 21 other letters to consider.

Since we know E is in position 5, we can think of common 5-letter words ending in E that also contain A and S. Common consonants that haven’t been eliminated include T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc. 

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that includes two new common consonants plus the known A and S, while keeping E at the end. A good candidate is ""STANE"" (an old word meaning to astonish) or ""STAKE"". ""STAKE"" is more common and uses K, which is a useful consonant to test. 

Let’s go with STAKE:
- S is in the word, but we’re testing it in position 1.
- T is a new consonant.
- A is a known vowel, testing it in position 3.
- K is a new consonant.
- E is pinned at position 5.

From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.  
   - A must be somewhere, but not position 1.  
   - S must be somewhere, but not position 4.  
   - R and O are completely absent.

2. STAKE → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) K(✓) E(✓)
   - This tells us the exact positions of four letters:
     - S in position 1
     - A in position 3
     - K in position 4
     - E in position 5
   - T is absent, so we can eliminate any words containing T.
   - The only unknown left is position 2.

So the pattern is:
S _ A K E

We need a single letter (not R, O, T) for the 2nd spot that forms a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s test each remaining common consonant in position 2:

- S B A K E → SBAKE (invalid)
- S C A K E → SCAKE (valid variant of “scaup” or “scoke”) → “SCAKE” is too obscure
- S D A K E → SDAKE (invalid)
- S F A K E → SFAKE (invalid)
- S H A K E → SHAKE (perfect, common word)
- S L A K E → SLATE (but T is banned, so SLATE is invalid)
- S M A K E → SMAKE (invalid)
- S N A K E → SNAKE (valid and common)
- S P A K E → SPAKE (archaic past tense of “speak”, but dictionary-valid)

Among these, “SHAKE” and “SNAKE” are the most common. Both fit the constraints, but we only need one for the next guess. I’ll choose “SHAKE” because it checks H (another high-frequency letter) and is a common word. If it’s correct we’ll get all ✓’s; if not, we’ll still narrow it down further.

Thus, the guess is:
