For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the target word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can appear in many positions. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common consonants: T, N, S, R, L
- Most common vowels: E, A, O, I, U

""AROSE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters can appear in multiple positions
- It gives good coverage for both vowels and consonants

This should provide maximum information about which letters are present in the target word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word.
- R (-) – R is in the word but wrong position.
- O (-) – O is in the word but wrong position.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (-) – E is in the word but wrong position.

So:
- Forbidden letters: A, S
- Present letters: R, O, E (each must appear somewhere, but not where they were)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, O, E exactly once each (no duplicates of any of them).
2. Places each of R, O, E in a different position than in AROSE:
   - R was in position 2 → must be 1, 3, 4, or 5
   - O was in position 3 → must be 1, 2, 4, or 5
   - E was in position 5 → must be 1, 2, 3, or 4
3. Does not contain A or S.
4. Uses two new letters (from the remaining 21 letters) to fill the remaining positions.

Popular word with R, O, E that fits:
- ""ROGER"" has R twice and G which we haven’t tested yet, but also duplicates R.
- ""OCEAN"" has O and E but also A which is forbidden.
- ""COWER"" has O, E, R and two new letters C, W.

Check constraints for ""COWER"":

  - O is now in position 2 (was 3) → ok.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the secret word ends in OWER and the first letter is not L (because LOWER got L(x)).

Forbidden first letters so far: A, S, C, L.

All other consonants (except those already used: O, W, E, R) are still possible.  
Looking at the pattern _OWER:

- BOWER – B not forbidden
- DOWER – D not forbidden
- FOWER – uncommon
- GOWER – uncommon
- HOWER – uncommon
- JOWER – uncommon
- MOWER – M not forbidden
- POWER – P not forbidden
- TOWER – T not forbidden
- VOWER – uncommon
- YOWER – uncommon

Of these, common English 5-letter words are BOWER, DOWER, MOWER, POWER, TOWER.

We’ll pick one of these; alphabetical order suggests BOWER first.

B is not forbidden, so BOWER is valid.

Among those, the only dictionary-recognized 5-letter words ending in OWER are:

- DOWER
- GOWER (rare)
- MOWER
- POWER

We already ruled out C, L, B. The next one in natural order is DOWER.

D is not forbidden.

So far we know the word is _ O W E R and the first letter has been rejected in this order:
A, C, L, B, D.

The remaining common letters that can start a 5-letter word ending in OWER are:
F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at standard English dictionaries, the valid words are:
- POWER
- MOWER
- TOWER
- GOWER (rare)
- SOWER
-ROWER
- VOWER (rare)
- YOWER (rare)

Among these, POWER is the most common; P has not yet been tried.

Hence the logical next guess is POWER.
