Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work from. The best strategy here is to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gained. A good opening word should include:

1. Common vowels to check their presence/absence (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters that might waste guesses

Looking at the most frequent letters in English 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This will give us good information about which of these 5 letters are in the target word and their potential positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓)

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants (T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, U) plus the known O.

Since O cannot be in position 3, it could be 1, 2, or 4. To maximize information gain, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Puts O in a different spot (let’s try position 2).
- Uses 3 new consonants that are frequent and haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “TONED”:
- T (new letter)
- O (known in-word, now in position 2)
- N (new letter)
- E (confirmed in position 4, but we know it’s actually position 5 – oops, this is wrong. I need to keep E in position 5.)

Let me rethink:
The known is E in position 5, O somewhere else (not 3). Try “POINT”:
- P (new)
- O in position 2
- I (new vowel)
- N (new)
- T (new)
But this doesn’t end with E. Need a word ending in E.

Better: “OPIATE” – 6 letters, invalid.

Try “OLIVE”:

This meets all constraints:

From the feedback so far we know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ both times).
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from Guess 2 it was in position 1 and still wrong place).
3. L is not in the word (x in Guess 2).
4. I is not in the word (x in Guess 2).
5. V is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2 it was in position 4 and still wrong place).
6. A, R, S are not in the word (from Guess 1).

So the word has:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Contains O and V, with restrictions:
  - O cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in position 4
  - V cannot be in position 4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 3

The structure must be: _ _ _ O E (since O must be in position 4)
But then V must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need three more consonants that haven't been used or ruled out. Available letters (excluding A, R, S, L, I):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (O and E already accounted for)

A good candidate would put V in position 1, 2, or 3 and use common remaining consonants. Let's try ""VOICE"":
- V in position 1
- O in position 4 (as required)
- I is not in word (ruled out) - can't use this.

Next try ""VOTER"":
- V in position 1
- O in position 2 (but O must be in position 4) - invalid

Try ""COVER"":
- C in position 1
- O in position 2 (but must be 4) - invalid

Wait, the structure must be: _ _ _ O E with V in positions 1-3. So possible:
V _ _ O E
_ V _ O E
_ _ V O E

Let's try ""VOTE"" - but we need 5 letters ending with E. How about ""VOTED"" - but E is already in position 5.

The structure is strictly _ _ _ O E. So we need three letters in positions 1-3, with V somewhere in 1-3.

Let's try:
D V N O E → ""DVNOE"" not a word
B U D O E → ""BUDOE"" not a word
C O is in 4, E in 5. Need 3 letters.

Let's systematically list possible words ending with OE (but that would be 4 letters). Actually the structure is:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? ? O E
With V in 1,2, or 3.

Possible words:
- C O V O E - not valid
- B O V O E - not valid
- D O V O E - not valid
- P O V O E - not valid

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending with OE... There aren't many. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, the feedback shows V is in the word but wrong position (from OLIVE where V was in position 4). So V must be in positions 1,2, or 3. And O must be in position 4.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]O E with V in 1,2, or 3.

Valid English words that fit:
- B O V O E - none
- C O V O E - none
- D O V O E - none
- H O V O E - none
- M O V O E - none
- P O V O E - none
- T O V O E - none
- N O V O E - none

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ O E, and V must be in 1-3. Some possibilities:
- B O V O E - not a word
- C O V O E - not a word
- D O V O E - not a word
- F O V O E - not a word
- G O V O E - not a word
- H O V O E - not a word
- J O V O E - not a word
- K O V O E - not a word
- M O V O E - not a word
- N O V O E - not a word
- P O V O E - not a word
- Q O V O E - not a word
- T O V O E - not a word
- W O V O E - not a word
- X O V O E - not a word
- Y O V O E - not a word
- Z O V O E - not a word

I realize I'm overcomplicating. The structure is [1][2][3]O E, and V must be in 1,2, or 3. Possible English words:
- MOVIE - but that's 5 letters with I (ruled out)
- COVE - 4 letters
- DOVE - 4 letters
- HOVE - 4 letters
- LOVE - 4 letters
- NOVE - not a word
- POVE - not a word
- ROVE - but R is ruled out
- WOVE - W, O, V, E - but needs 5 letters

I see the issue - there are very few 5-letter words ending with OE. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions.

Wait, the feedback shows:
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- O is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from OLIVE feedback: O(-) means it's in word but wrong position, and it was in position 1)
- So O must be in position 4
- V is in the word but not in position 4 (from OLIVE: V(-) means wrong position, it was in position 4)
- So V must be in positions 1, 2, or 3
- The structure is: [1][2][3]O E

Real English words that fit:
- MOVIE - contains I (ruled out)
- HOVED - but we need 5 letters ending with OE, not ED
- COVED - same issue
- BOOGE - not a word
- FOOGE - not a word
- NOOGE - not a word

I think the correct approach is to look for 5-letter words ending with OE. There are very few, but some exist:
- CANOE - contains A (ruled out)
- PEKOE - contains P, E, K, O, E - but E is already in position 5
- SPOKE - contains S (ruled out)
- BROKE - contains B, R (ruled out), O, K, E - but R is ruled out
- CHOKE - contains C, H, O, K, E - let's check:
  - C: allowed
  - H: allowed
  - O: in position 3 but must be in 4 - no
- JOKER - contains J, O, K, E, R - but R is ruled out
- TOKEN - contains T, O, K, E, N - let's check:
  - T, O, K, E, N - E in position 5 is correct
  - O is in position 2 - but must be in position 4 - no
- WOKEN - contains W, O, K, E, N - O in position 2 - must be 4 - no
- VOGUE - contains V, O, G, U, E - E in position 5 correct, O in position 2 - must be 4 - no
- VOICE - contains V, O, I (ruled out) - no
- VOGUE - already checked

This is tricky. Let me try a different approach - perhaps O is in position 4, and V is in 1,2, or 3, and we need to find a valid word.

Valid 5-letter words ending with OE:
- CANOE (A ruled out)
- PEKOE (P, E, K, O, E) - E is position 5, O position 4, K and P are allowed
- Let's check PEKOE:
  - P, E, K, O, E
  - E is position 5 ✓
  - O is position 4 ✓
  - P and K are new, allowed letters
  - V is not in this word, but we know V is in the word - contradiction

This shows PEKOE can't be correct because V must be present. I need to find words with both V and O in positions 4 and V elsewhere.

This seems impossible with standard words. Maybe I made an error interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading:
- From OLIVE: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 1
- V(-) means V is in word but not in position 4
- E(✓) in position 5
- So possible positions:
  - O could be 2,3,4
  - V could be 1,2,3
  - E is 5

Looking for 5-letter words with:
- E in position 5
- O and V present, with O not in 1, V not in 4
Possible words:
- VOTER - V(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) - but R is ruled out
- VOGUE - V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) - O in 2 is allowed, V in 1 is allowed
- VOGUE has O in 2 (allowed), V in 1 (allowed), and all other letters allowed
- Let's check all letters:
  - V: allowed (must be present)
  - O: allowed (must be present)
  - G: allowed
  - U: allowed (vowel not yet tried)
  - E: confirmed position 5

This seems valid - VOGUE fits all constraints.

</think>

From the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5 (✓ both times)
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (from OLIVE: O(-))
- V is in the word but not in position 4 (from OLIVE: V(-))
- Ruled out letters: A, R, S, L, I

The word must contain both O and V, with O in positions 2-4 and V in positions 1-3. A valid word fitting this is **VOGUE**:
- V (position 1, allowed)
- O (position 2, allowed)
- G (new letter)
- U (new vowel)
- E (position 5, confirmed)

<guess>VOGUE</guess>",VOGUE,"From the feedback so far we know:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ both times).
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from Guess 2 it was in position 1 and still wrong place).
3. L is not in the word (x in Guess 2).
4. I is not in the word (x in Guess 2).
5. V is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2 it was in position 4 and still wrong place).
6. A, R, S are not in the word (from Guess 1).

So the word has:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Contains O and V, with restrictions:
  - O cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in position 4
  - V cannot be in position 4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 3

The structure must be: _ _ _ O E (since O must be in position 4)
But then V must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need three more consonants that haven't been used or ruled out. Available letters (excluding A, R, S, L, I):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (O and E already accounted for)

A good candidate would put V in position 1, 2, or 3 and use common remaining consonants. Let's try ""VOICE"":
- V in position 1
- O in position 4 (as required)
- I is not in word (ruled out) - can't use this.

Next try ""VOTER"":
- V in position 1
- O in position 2 (but O must be in position 4) - invalid

Try ""COVER"":
- C in position 1
- O in position 2 (but must be 4) - invalid

Wait, the structure must be: _ _ _ O E with V in positions 1-3. So possible:
V _ _ O E
_ V _ O E
_ _ V O E

Let's try ""VOTE"" - but we need 5 letters ending with E. How about ""VOTED"" - but E is already in position 5.

The structure is strictly _ _ _ O E. So we need three letters in positions 1-3, with V somewhere in 1-3.

Let's try:
D V N O E → ""DVNOE"" not a word
B U D O E → ""BUDOE"" not a word
C O is in 4, E in 5. Need 3 letters.

Let's systematically list possible words ending with OE (but that would be 4 letters). Actually the structure is:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? ? O E
With V in 1,2, or 3.

Possible words:
- C O V O E - not valid
- B O V O E - not valid
- D O V O E - not valid
- P O V O E - not valid

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending with OE... There aren't many. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, the feedback shows V is in the word but wrong position (from OLIVE where V was in position 4). So V must be in positions 1,2, or 3. And O must be in position 4.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]O E with V in 1,2, or 3.

Valid English words that fit:
- B O V O E - none
- C O V O E - none
- D O V O E - none
- H O V O E - none
- M O V O E - none
- P O V O E - none
- T O V O E - none
- N O V O E - none

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ O E, and V must be in 1-3. Some possibilities:
- B O V O E - not a word
- C O V O E - not a word
- D O V O E - not a word
- F O V O E - not a word
- G O V O E - not a word
- H O V O E - not a word
- J O V O E - not a word
- K O V O E - not a word
- M O V O E - not a word
- N O V O E - not a word
- P O V O E - not a word
- Q O V O E - not a word
- T O V O E - not a word
- W O V O E - not a word
- X O V O E - not a word
- Y O V O E - not a word
- Z O V O E - not a word

I realize I'm overcomplicating. The structure is [1][2][3]O E, and V must be in 1,2, or 3. Possible English words:
- MOVIE - but that's 5 letters with I (ruled out)
- COVE - 4 letters
- DOVE - 4 letters
- HOVE - 4 letters
- LOVE - 4 letters
- NOVE - not a word
- POVE - not a word
- ROVE - but R is ruled out
- WOVE - W, O, V, E - but needs 5 letters

I see the issue - there are very few 5-letter words ending with OE. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions.

Wait, the feedback shows:
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- O is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from OLIVE feedback: O(-) means it's in word but wrong position, and it was in position 1)
- So O must be in position 4
- V is in the word but not in position 4 (from OLIVE: V(-) means wrong position, it was in position 4)
- So V must be in positions 1, 2, or 3
- The structure is: [1][2][3]O E

Real English words that fit:
- MOVIE - contains I (ruled out)
- HOVED - but we need 5 letters ending with OE, not ED
- COVED - same issue
- BOOGE - not a word
- FOOGE - not a word
- NOOGE - not a word

I think the correct approach is to look for 5-letter words ending with OE. There are very few, but some exist:
- CANOE - contains A (ruled out)
- PEKOE - contains P, E, K, O, E - but E is already in position 5
- SPOKE - contains S (ruled out)
- BROKE - contains B, R (ruled out), O, K, E - but R is ruled out
- CHOKE - contains C, H, O, K, E - let's check:
  - C: allowed
  - H: allowed
  - O: in position 3 but must be in 4 - no
- JOKER - contains J, O, K, E, R - but R is ruled out
- TOKEN - contains T, O, K, E, N - let's check:
  - T, O, K, E, N - E in position 5 is correct
  - O is in position 2 - but must be in position 4 - no
- WOKEN - contains W, O, K, E, N - O in position 2 - must be 4 - no
- VOGUE - contains V, O, G, U, E - E in position 5 correct, O in position 2 - must be 4 - no
- VOICE - contains V, O, I (ruled out) - no
- VOGUE - already checked

This is tricky. Let me try a different approach - perhaps O is in position 4, and V is in 1,2, or 3, and we need to find a valid word.

Valid 5-letter words ending with OE:
- CANOE (A ruled out)
- PEKOE (P, E, K, O, E) - E is position 5, O position 4, K and P are allowed
- Let's check PEKOE:
  - P, E, K, O, E
  - E is position 5 ✓
  - O is position 4 ✓
  - P and K are new, allowed letters
  - V is not in this word, but we know V is in the word - contradiction

This shows PEKOE can't be correct because V must be present. I need to find words with both V and O in positions 4 and V elsewhere.

This seems impossible with standard words. Maybe I made an error interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading:
- From OLIVE: O(-) means O is in word but not in position 1
- V(-) means V is in word but not in position 4
- E(✓) in position 5
- So possible positions:
  - O could be 2,3,4
  - V could be 1,2,3
  - E is 5

Looking for 5-letter words with:
- E in position 5
- O and V present, with O not in 1, V not in 4
Possible words:
- VOTER - V(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) - but R is ruled out
- VOGUE - V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) - O in 2 is allowed, V in 1 is allowed
- VOGUE has O in 2 (allowed), V in 1 (allowed), and all other letters allowed
- Let's check all letters:
  - V: allowed (must be present)
  - O: allowed (must be present)
  - G: allowed
  - U: allowed (vowel not yet tried)
  - E: confirmed position 5

This seems valid - VOGUE fits all constraints.From the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5 (✓ both times)
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (from OLIVE: O(-))
- V is in the word but not in position 4 (from OLIVE: V(-))
- Ruled out letters: A, R, S, L, I

The word must contain both O and V, with O in positions 2-4 and V in positions 1-3. A valid word fitting this is **VOGUE**:
- V (position 1, allowed)
- O (position 2, allowed)
- G (new letter)
- U (new vowel)
- E (position 5, confirmed)",Guess 3: VOGUE -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) O(✓) G(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
