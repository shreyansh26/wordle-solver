For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words.
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.
3. Has no repeating letters to maximize the information gained from each position.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AUDIO."" However, ""AUDIO"" is vowel-heavy and might not give good consonant information. ""SLATE"" is strong because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and a vowel. But ""CRANE"" might be slightly better as it has C, R, N which are very common letters.

Another strong contender is ""AROSE"" - it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). But I think ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy.

After consideration, ""CRANE"" seems like a balanced choice that covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (extremely common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

3. Avoids any letters already eliminated (C, A, N, S, T, O).
4. Uses several new common letters to maximize information.

Candidates:
- R I D E ? – but we need 5 letters ending in E.
- R I D G E (RIDGE) – has R in 1, D, I, G, E – all new letters, fits constraints.
- D R I V E – R in 3, but V and D are new, but V is less common.
- B R I D E – R in 2, but position 2 is already eliminated for R (from CRANE feedback).

RIDGE seems best: R in position 1, introduces D, I, G, and keeps E in 5.

Summary of everything we now know:

3. G is fixed in position 4.
4. Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, O, I, D.

So the word structure is:
_ _ R G E

We still need to discover positions 1 and 2, using only the remaining letters (common ones left: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

We want a new 5-letter word that:
- Matches _ _ R G E
- Uses two new, common letters for the first two slots.

Possible valid words:
- BURGE (but U is not yet ruled out; B and U are new)
- HURGE (invalid)
- PURGE (P and U are new)
- VERGE (V and E are new, but E already fixed)
- MERGE (M and E are new, but E already fixed)
- LURGE (invalid, not a common word)

The most common and valid word is PURGE: P and U are entirely new letters, and it fits _ _ R G E perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess should be PURGE.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words.
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.
3. Has no repeating letters to maximize the information gained from each position.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AUDIO."" However, ""AUDIO"" is vowel-heavy and might not give good consonant information. ""SLATE"" is strong because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and a vowel. But ""CRANE"" might be slightly better as it has C, R, N which are very common letters.

Another strong contender is ""AROSE"" - it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). But I think ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy.

After consideration, ""CRANE"" seems like a balanced choice that covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (extremely common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- E: ✓ → E is in the word AND in position 5.

What we now know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. R is somewhere in the word but not in slot 2.
3. No A, C, N.

Letters remaining to test: common ones like S, T, L, D, P, etc.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains R but not in slot 2.
- Avoids A, C, N.

Possible structures: _ R _ _ E, _ _ R _ E, or _ _ _ R E.

A good next word that meets these criteria and adds new common letters is ""STRIE"" – but ""STRIE"" is not a common valid word. A better option is ""STORE"":
- S: new letter
- T: new letter
