As this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word often contains:
- At least 2 vowels
- Common consonants
- No repeating letters (to maximize information gain)

Popular starting words include: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Covers multiple high-frequency letters

This should give us good initial information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- E is at position 4 (✓)

Still missing the letters in positions 1 and 3, and we need two different letters (since no repeats are indicated).  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, T, W).

A common approach is to use another word that:
- Fixes the known letters in their correct spots (O, E, R).
- Tries two new common consonants in positions 1 and 3.

Good candidates:
- C O D E R – CODER (common word, introduces C, D)
- H O N E R – HONER (introduces H, N)
- P O K E R – POKER (introduces P, K)
- M O V E R – MOVER (introduces M, V)

Among these, CODER feels most likely: C and D are both common, and CODER is a common English word that fits the pattern _ O _ E R perfectly.

(Note: we must avoid any word that would repeat a letter already ruled out or reuse any of the known letters in a new position, but CODER does not do that.)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>As this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word often contains:
- At least 2 vowels
- Common consonants
- No repeating letters (to maximize information gain)

Popular starting words include: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Covers multiple high-frequency letters

This should give us good initial information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Letters in the word (positions unknown): R, O, E

We need a new word that:
1. Must include R, O, E somewhere
2. Must avoid A and S
3. Should use new common letters to gather more info

A good second-guess candidate would be:
- ""ROUTE"" – but this has the same R position as before (invalid, since R can't be in position 2)
- ""OTHER"" – contains O, R, E, plus T and H which are common
- ""TROPE"" – but this has R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""PEORU"" – not a valid English word
- ""TOWER"" – contains O, E, R plus T and W (new letters)

""TOWER"" seems good:
- Contains O (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)
- Introduces T and W as new letters
- Doesn't repeat A or S
- All letters are unique
- R is in position 5, which is new for R

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters not in the word: A, S, T, W  
Letters in the word: O, E, R  

Exact positions so far:
- O is at position 2 (✓)
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- R is at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the pattern:

_ O _ E R

Still missing the letters in positions 1 and 3, and we need two different letters (since no repeats are indicated).  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, T, W).

A common approach is to use another word that:
- Fixes the known letters in their correct spots (O, E, R).
- Tries two new common consonants in positions 1 and 3.

Good candidates:
- C O D E R – CODER (common word, introduces C, D)
- H O N E R – HONER (introduces H, N)
- P O K E R – POKER (introduces P, K)
- M O V E R – MOVER (introduces M, V)

Among these, CODER feels most likely: C and D are both common, and CODER is a common English word that fits the pattern _ O _ E R perfectly.

(Note: we must avoid any word that would repeat a letter already ruled out or reuse any of the known letters in a new position, but CODER does not do that.)

- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Letters in the word (positions unknown): R, O, E

We need a new word that:
1. Must include R, O, E somewhere
2. Must avoid A and S
3. Should use new common letters to gather more info

A good second-guess candidate would be:
- ""ROUTE"" – but this has the same R position as before (invalid, since R can't be in position 2)
- ""OTHER"" – contains O, R, E, plus T and H which are common
- ""TROPE"" – but this has R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""PEORU"" – not a valid English word
- ""TOWER"" – contains O, E, R plus T and W (new letters)

""TOWER"" seems good:
- Contains O (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)
- Introduces T and W as new letters
- Doesn't repeat A or S
- All letters are unique
- R is in position 5, which is new for R

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters not in the word: A, S, T, W  
Letters in the word: O, E, R  

Exact positions so far:
- O is at position 2 (✓)
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- R is at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the pattern:

_ O _ E R

Still missing the letters in positions 1 and 3, and we need two different letters (since no repeats are indicated).  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, T, W).

A common approach is to use another word that:
- Fixes the known letters in their correct spots (O, E, R).
- Tries two new common consonants in positions 1 and 3.

Good candidates:
- C O D E R – CODER (common word, introduces C, D)
- H O N E R – HONER (introduces H, N)
- P O K E R – POKER (introduces P, K)
- M O V E R – MOVER (introduces M, V)

Among these, CODER feels most likely: C and D are both common, and CODER is a common English word that fits the pattern _ O _ E R perfectly.

(Note: we must avoid any word that would repeat a letter already ruled out or reuse any of the known letters in a new position, but CODER does not do that.)

3. Pattern so far: _ O _ E R  

We still need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters we haven’t ruled out.  
Remaining candidate letters (common): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word of the form ? O ? E R.

Possible combinations:
- B O N E R – BONER (letters B, N not yet tested)
- H O N E R – already considered but HONER is a word and uses H, N
- M O V E R – already considered but M, V still allowed
- L O V E R – LOVER uses L, V
- F O R E R – not a valid English word
- G O N E R – GONER uses G, N
- P O K E R – POKER uses P, K

Between BONER, HONER, LOVER, GONER, POKER—all are legal—BONER introduces two new common letters (B and N) and is a fairly common word. It also avoids repeating any already-excluded letters.

So we’ll test BONER next.

- The pattern is: _ O _ E R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with any remaining letters that have not been eliminated.

Available letters (common ones first): F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We want a valid English 5-letter word of the form ? O ? E R.

Scanning common words:
- F O G E R  (FOGER – not a standard word)
- H O M E R  (HOMER – valid)
- J O K E R  (JOKER – valid, uses J, K)
- L O V E R  (LOVER – valid, uses L, V)
- M O V E R  (MOVER – valid, uses M, V)
- P O K E R  (POKER – valid, uses P, K)
- V O T E R  (VOTER – but T is eliminated)

Between them, the most common and likely is HOMER (H and M are both new, and HOMER is a very common word).

Let’s try HOMER.
