For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common English letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some excellent choices are:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and historically performs well in Wordle.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S and E are in the word and in the correct positions (last two letters).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Word ends in “SE”.
- Cannot contain A, R, O.

Letters still worth trying: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good candidates are those that use common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out:
- “INSET” – but O is ruled out, I and N are still possible.
- “USAGE” – but A is ruled out.
- “SPIKE” – but R is ruled out.
- “WISPE” – uses W, I, S, P, E (but E is correct in the last spot, so this is fine).

A strong next guess that introduces new, common letters while fitting the constraints is “SPIKE”.

Check:
- Ends in “KE”? No, we need “SE”. So “SPIKE” is invalid.

Better: “INSET” – ends in “SET”, but we need “SE”. “INSET” is 5 letters ending in “T”, which is wrong.

A valid 5-letter word ending in “SE” without A, R, O:
- “HOUSE” – but O is out.
- “LIESE” – not a word.
- “RISE” – too short.
- “FALSE” – but A is out.
- “HORSE” – but O and R are out.
- “GUESS” – but S is already correct in 4th spot, and this would have S in 1st and 4th, which might be allowed, but let’s check.

Actually, let’s think systematically: word is _ _ _ S E, and cannot contain A, R, O.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good 5-letter words ending in “SE” without A, R, O:

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE -> A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)  
   – S and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.  
   – A, R, O are not in the word at all.

   – Confirms again that S and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.  
   – P, U, L are not in the word.

So far we know:  
Pattern: _ _ _ S E  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, P, U, L.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, T, V, W, Y.

We want a word that ends in “SE” (positions 4 and 5 fixed), does **not** contain any of the forbidden letters, and contains only the remaining letters.

A few valid 5-letter English words ending in “SE” and avoiding the banned letters:

- BRISE – but R is banned.  
- CHASE – A is banned.  
- DRISE – R is banned.  
- FRISE – R is banned.  
- HINSE – not an English word.  
- MISSE – not a word (double S issue).  
- MENSE – archaic variant of “dense”, but rare.  
- WISSE – archaic, not ideal.  
- MULSE – not a word.  
- TENSE – T and N are still available.  
- FINES – I, N are available, but A is banned (F I N E S) – A is not in it.  
- HINGE – ends with E but not with SE.

Actually, let’s list legal patterns more systematically:

_ _ _ S E  
Forbidden letters in any position: A, R, O, P, U, L.

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three more letters before the final “SE”. Common English endings:

- “ISE” is out (I S E) – sometimes used.  
- “USE” is out (U banned).  
- “OSE” out (O banned).  
- “NSE” – possible (N S E) – e.g., “dense” but A is already banned.  
- “ISE” is fine with I as a vowel.

Possible 5-letter words ending in “ISE” but we need “_ _ _ S E.” So the third letter before SE must be a consonant.

Let’s check “M I S E” – but we need 5 letters, and positions 4 and 5 are S and E. So the word is _ _ _ S E.

Good candidate:  
- “M I S E” becomes “MI SE” but we need 5 letters: “M” “I” “N” “S” “E”  → “MINSE” – not a word.  
- “T I N S E” – “TINSE” – not a word.  
- “C H I S E” – too many letters.  
- “D I N S E” – “DINSE” – not a word.  
- “T I M E S” – “TIMES” – but S is in position 4, E in 5, so it would be T I M E S – but E is position 5, S position 4, so it’s T I M S E – but that’s “TIMSE” which is not a word.

Let’s step back: we need a 5-letter word ending in “SE”, with no A, R, O, P, U, L, and whose first three letters are from B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Real English words ending in “SE” without those letters:

- “DULSE” – but L is banned.  
- “MENSE” – archaic, but valid.  
- “TENSE” – T, E, N, S, E – fits: T E N S E.  
   – Letters: T, E, N, S, E.  
   – E is position 5 (correct), S is position 4 (correct).  
   – T, E, N are in positions 1, 2, 3.  
   – No banned letters (A, R, O, P, U, L are absent).  

“TENSE” is a valid, common word. It’s the best next guess.

Actually, let’s list legal patterns more systematically:

_ _ _ S E  
Forbidden letters in any position: A, R, O, P, U, L.

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three more letters before the final “SE”. Common English endings:

- “ISE” is out (I S E) – sometimes used.  
- “USE” is out (U banned).  
- “OSE” out (O banned).  
- “NSE” – possible (N S E) – e.g., “dense” but A is already banned.  
- “ISE” is fine with I as a vowel.

Possible 5-letter words ending in “ISE” but we need “_ _ _ S E.” So the third letter before SE must be a consonant.

Let’s check “M I S E” – but we need 5 letters, and positions 4 and 5 are S and E. So the word is _ _ _ S E.

Good candidate:  
- “M I S E” becomes “MI SE” but we need 5 letters: “M” “I” “N” “S” “E”  → “MINSE” – not a word.  
- “T I N S E” – “TINSE” – not a word.  
- “C H I S E” – too many letters.  
- “D I N S E” – “DINSE” – not a word.  
- “T I M E S” – “TIMES” – but S is in position 4, E in 5, so it would be T I M E S – but E is position 5, S position 4, so it’s T I M S E – but that’s “TIMSE” which is not a word.

Let’s step back: we need a 5-letter word ending in “SE”, with no A, R, O, P, U, L, and whose first three letters are from B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Real English words ending in “SE” without those letters:

- “DULSE” – but L is banned.  
- “MENSE” – archaic, but valid.  
- “TENSE” – T, E, N, S, E – fits: T E N S E.  
   – Letters: T, E, N, S, E.  
   – E is position 5 (correct), S is position 4 (correct).  
   – T, E, N are in positions 1, 2, 3.  
   – No banned letters (A, R, O, P, U, L are absent).  

“TENSE” is a valid, common word. It’s the best next guess.",Guess 3: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
