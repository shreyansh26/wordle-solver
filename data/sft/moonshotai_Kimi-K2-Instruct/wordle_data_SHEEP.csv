For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (common letters S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (vowels A, E, I, O, U)
- CRANE (common letters C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of frequently used letters.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (all marked “x”).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked “–”).

So we know:
1. The word definitely has an E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position (since the E in CRANE was in position 5 and is marked “-”).
2. None of C, R, A, N are present at all.
3. We still know nothing about the other 21 letters.

A good next guess maximizes new information while incorporating the E somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried include T, S, L, D, P, M, B, etc. A word like “STOLE” uses fresh consonants plus the known E. However, “STOLE” has E in position 5 again, which we already ruled out. Instead, let’s try a word that moves E to position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. “ETHOS” is option, but it re-uses T and S with E in position 1; “PELT” is too short; “BLEED” has E twice and B, L, D, none of which are ruled out yet. 

A balanced choice is “BLEED” because:
- It keeps E in position 4 (new slot).
- Introduces B, L, D which are untested and fairly common.
- Avoids C, R, A, N.

From the new feedback on BLEED:
- B, L, D are NOT in the word (x).
- The two E’s are both marked ✓, which tells us:
  – Position 3 must be E.
  – Position 4 must be E.
This is an impossible pattern for a 5-letter English word (no word has E twice in a row at positions 3 and 4), so the only way both E’s can be ✓ is if they actually overlap in position. This implies the single E in the secret word is located at BOTH positions 3 and 4, which again is impossible. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the second E was in the correct spot (position 4) and the first E was in the correct spot (position 3) – meaning the word contains two E’s adjacent at positions 3-4. The only common 5-letter word with “EE” in the middle is “CHEEP” or “SHEET” or “SWEET” or “MEETS”, etc. But we already know C, R, A, N, B, L, D are excluded.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (common letters S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (vowels A, E, I, O, U)
- CRANE (common letters C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of frequently used letters.

- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (all marked “x”).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked “–”).

So we know:
1. The word definitely has an E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position (since the E in CRANE was in position 5 and is marked “-”).
2. None of C, R, A, N are present at all.
3. We still know nothing about the other 21 letters.

A good next guess maximizes new information while incorporating the E somewhere else. Common consonants we haven’t tried include T, S, L, D, P, M, B, etc. A word like “STOLE” uses fresh consonants plus the known E. However, “STOLE” has E in position 5 again, which we already ruled out. Instead, let’s try a word that moves E to position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. “ETHOS” is option, but it re-uses T and S with E in position 1; “PELT” is too short; “BLEED” has E twice and B, L, D, none of which are ruled out yet. 

A balanced choice is “BLEED” because:
- It keeps E in position 4 (new slot).
- Introduces B, L, D which are untested and fairly common.
- Avoids C, R, A, N.

- B, L, D are NOT in the word (x).

This is an impossible pattern for a 5-letter English word (no word has E twice in a row at positions 3 and 4), so the only way both E’s can be ✓ is if they actually overlap in position. This implies the single E in the secret word is located at BOTH positions 3 and 4, which again is impossible. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the second E was in the correct spot (position 4) and the first E was in the correct spot (position 3) – meaning the word contains two E’s adjacent at positions 3-4. The only common 5-letter word with “EE” in the middle is “CHEEP” or “SHEET” or “SWEET” or “MEETS”, etc. But we already know C, R, A, N, B, L, D are excluded. So valid candidates that contain “EE” in positions 3-4 and avoid the excluded letters include:
- SWEET (S, W not yet ruled out)
