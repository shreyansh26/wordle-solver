For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeat letters
- Letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are present/absent in the secret word.

From the new feedback on STEIN:

- S is now in the CORRECT position (position 1).
- E is in the word (and since it’s in position 3 in STEIN and got ✓, it must also be in position 3 in the solution).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4 in STEIN).
- T and N are NOT in the word.

So far we know the solution looks like:
S _ E _ _

Letters confirmed in the word so far:
- S (position 1, locked)
- E (position 3, locked)
- I (somewhere in the word, but not position 4)

Letters ruled out:
- A, R, O, T, N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in position 3
3. Contains I somewhere other than position 4
4. No A, R, O, T, N

Possible positions for I: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are taken by S and E, and 4 is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm words that fit S _ E _ _ with I in 2 or 5:
- If I is in 2: S I E _ _
  - Possible: SIEST? Not a word. SIEGS? SIEVS? No.
- If I is in 5: S _ E _ I
  - Possible: SHEIK (but H and K haven’t been tested yet)
  - S P E C I? SPECI isn’t valid.
  - S H E B I? SHEBI isn’t valid.
  - S L E D I? SLEDI isn’t valid.
  - S W E E I? SWEEI isn’t valid.
  - S H E E I? SHEEI isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s think of valid words:
- SHEIK (5-letter, valid: S H E I K)
  - Checks: S at 1 ✓, E at 3 ✓, I at 4 (but feedback said I is in the word but wrong position in STEIN, where it was at 4, so I cannot be at 4 again. Thus SHEIK is invalid because I is at 4.)
  
Hmm, seems I is only allowed at position 2 or 5. Let’s try:
- SPIEL: S P I E L
  - S at 1 ✓, E at 4 (but we know E is at 3 from STEIN), so invalid.
  
Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From STEIN:
- S at 1 ✓ (so position 1 is S)
- E at 3 ✓ (so position 3 is E)
- I is in word but NOT at 4 (from STEIN feedback: I was at 4 and got ""-"")

So possible positions for I: 2 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:
- S I E _ _ : SIEST is invalid (not a word), SIEGS no.
- S _ E _ I : S P E C I? SPECI is not a valid word.
- S H E E I? No.
- S P E L I? SPELI no.
- S W E E I? No.
- S P E E D? No I.
- S P E L L? No I.
- S H E L I? SHELI no.
- S P E R I? R is out.
- S P E C K? No I.
  
Wait, is there a word with S _ E I _ ? That would put I at 4, but I cannot be at 4 from STEIN feedback.

Alternative approach: maybe I is at 2:
- S I E _ _ :
  - SIEGH? No.
  - SIEST? Not a word.
  - SIEVE? S I E V E (positions: 1 2 3 4 5)
    - V hasn’t been tested yet.
    - Letters: S, I, E, V, E – but E is already confirmed at 3, so this has E at 3 and 5, which is allowed (no rule against repeats).
    - Check letters: A, R, O, T, N are out. V is new, allowed.
    - Word: SIEVE – valid word.

Let me verify:
- S at 1 ✓
- I at 2 (new position for I)
- E at 3 ✓
- V new letter
- E at 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STEIN:

- S is now in the CORRECT position (position 1).
- E is in the word (and since it’s in position 3 in STEIN and got ✓, it must also be in position 3 in the solution).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4 in STEIN).
- T and N are NOT in the word.

So far we know the solution looks like:
S _ E _ _

Letters confirmed in the word so far:
- S (position 1, locked)
- E (position 3, locked)
- I (somewhere in the word, but not position 4)

Letters ruled out:
- A, R, O, T, N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in position 3
3. Contains I somewhere other than position 4
4. No A, R, O, T, N

Possible positions for I: 2 or 5 (since 1 and 3 are taken by S and E, and 4 is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm words that fit S _ E _ _ with I in 2 or 5:
- If I is in 2: S I E _ _
  - Possible: SIEST? Not a word. SIEGS? SIEVS? No.
- If I is in 5: S _ E _ I
  - Possible: SHEIK (but H and K haven’t been tested yet)
  - S P E C I? SPECI isn’t valid.
  - S H E B I? SHEBI isn’t valid.
  - S L E D I? SLEDI isn’t valid.
  - S W E E I? SWEEI isn’t valid.
  - S H E E I? SHEEI isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s think of valid words:
- SHEIK (5-letter, valid: S H E I K)
  - Checks: S at 1 ✓, E at 3 ✓, I at 4 (but feedback said I is in the word but wrong position in STEIN, where it was at 4, so I cannot be at 4 again. Thus SHEIK is invalid because I is at 4.)
  
Hmm, seems I is only allowed at position 2 or 5. Let’s try:
- SPIEL: S P I E L
  - S at 1 ✓, E at 4 (but we know E is at 3 from STEIN), so invalid.
  
Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From STEIN:
- S at 1 ✓ (so position 1 is S)
- E at 3 ✓ (so position 3 is E)
- I is in word but NOT at 4 (from STEIN feedback: I was at 4 and got ""-"")

So possible positions for I: 2 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:
- S I E _ _ : SIEST is invalid (not a word), SIEGS no.
- S _ E _ I : S P E C I? SPECI is not a valid word.
- S H E E I? No.
- S P E L I? SPELI no.
- S W E E I? No.
- S P E E D? No I.
- S P E L L? No I.
- S H E L I? SHELI no.
- S P E R I? R is out.
- S P E C K? No I.
  
Wait, is there a word with S _ E I _ ? That would put I at 4, but I cannot be at 4 from STEIN feedback.

Alternative approach: maybe I is at 2:
- S I E _ _ :
  - SIEGH? No.
  - SIEST? Not a word.
  - SIEVE? S I E V E (positions: 1 2 3 4 5)
    - V hasn’t been tested yet.
    - Letters: S, I, E, V, E – but E is already confirmed at 3, so this has E at 3 and 5, which is allowed (no rule against repeats).
    - Check letters: A, R, O, T, N are out. V is new, allowed.
    - Word: SIEVE – valid word.

Let me verify:
- S at 1 ✓
- I at 2 (new position for I)
- E at 3 ✓
- V new letter
- E at 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Starts with S (from STEIN: S at position 1 ✓)
- Has E in position 3 (from STEIN: E at position 3 ✓)
- Contains I, but not in position 4 (from STEIN: I was at 4 with ""-"")
- Excludes A, R, O, T, N (from prior guesses)

The word ""SIEVE"" fits these constraints:
- S I E V E
- S at 1 ✓
- E at 3 ✓
- I at 2 (allowed)
- Introduces V (new letter)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, N)

E –  (second E is in the word but NOT in position 5)

- Letters known to be in the word: S (fixed at 1), E (fixed at 3), I (somewhere, but not position 2 or 5 – so only possible at 4)
