2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is the first guess, so there's no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy here is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. 

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid less common letters to maximize the chance of hits

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- A, T, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ L _ _ _
- Letters to avoid completely: S, A, T, E
- We should try other common consonants and vowels for the remaining positions.

Good letters to include now: R, I, N, D, U, O, etc.
Let’s build a word that keeps L in place and introduces new common letters.

One candidate: BLIND
- B (new consonant)
- L (already known at position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

This fits the pattern _ L _ _ _ and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Summary of what we know:
Pattern so far: B L _ _ _
Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, I, N, D

Slots 3–5 must be filled using letters not yet eliminated.  
Good remaining consonants that are common: R, C, M, K  
Good remaining vowels: O, U

To maximize information we’ll test two fresh consonants plus a fresh vowel.  
Possible word forms: BL _ _ _

Candidate words:
- BLOWN – uses W, O (both unused so far) but W is only moderately common.  
- BLOCK – uses O, C, K – all new letters.  
- BLOOM – repeats O, so less informative.  
- BLURK – K is rare.

“BLOCK” gives us three new letters (O, C, K) in one guess and keeps the pattern.
