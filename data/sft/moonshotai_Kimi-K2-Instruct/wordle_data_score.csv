For the first guess, since I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me gather maximum information. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters or eliminate many possibilities early.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R and S appear somewhere, but not in their previous positions (R≠1, S≠4).
3. The letters A and I are not in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and S.
- Does not contain A or I.

Good candidates:
- ""STORE"" – has S and R, ends with E, but S is in position 4 (invalid since S≠4).
- ""SERVE"" – has S and E, but only one of the required letters (R/S).
- ""ROUSE"" – has R, S, and E, but I is excluded (this is fine since I is excluded).
- ""WORSE"" – has R, S, and E, and positions work (R is 2, S is 4 – but S≠4, so invalid).
- ""CREST"" – doesn't end with E.
- ""GREET"" – no S.
- ""ROSES"" – ends with S, not E.
- ""SPREE"" – has S, P, R, E, E – ends with E, but S is 1st position (allowed), R is 3rd position (allowed), E is 4th and 5th (but 5th must be E, which is correct).

Looking at ""SPREE"":
- S is in 1st position (allowed, since previously S was 4th and marked wrong position, 1st is new).
- P is new.
- R is in 3rd position (allowed, previously R was 1st and marked wrong position, 3rd is new).
- E is in 5th position (matches feedback).

This seems valid, as it tests new positions for S and R while keeping E fixed at the end.

But let's check another candidate: ""ROUSE"":
- R is 1st (invalid, since R≠1 from feedback).
- ""TORSE"":
- T, O, R, S, E: R is 4th (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), E is 5th (correct), and no A/I. This looks better.

""TORSE"" seems like a strong second guess:
- T, O, R, S, E – no A or I.
- R is 4th (allowed).
- S is 3rd (allowed).
- E is 5th (correct).

This maximizes new information while fitting all constraints.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters already confirmed NOT in the word:  
A, I, T

Letters confirmed to be in the word (but position still unknown):  
O, R, S, E  (with E fixed at position 5)

Known positions:  
E is at position 5.

Letter positions that have been ruled out:
- R cannot be 1 or 4  
- S cannot be 3 or 4  
- O cannot be 2  

So the word must be of the form:  
[?][?][?][?]E  
with O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4 and no repeats of letters already ruled out.

Possible placements:
- R can be 2 or 3
- S can be 1 or 2 (but not 3 or 4)
- O can be 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2)

We still need to test the consonant/vowel pattern that hasn’t been tried yet.

Popular 5-letter words ending in E that contain O, R, S and don’t repeat other excluded letters include: “ROSES” (but ends with S not E), “SORES” (same), “SOWER” (ends with R), “SPORE” (has P). Among valid candidates: “SPORE” fits the pattern.

However, let’s pick a word that places each of the unknown letters in a new, untested position and avoids every ruled-out spot.

A good choice is: “ROOSE”  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, only ruled out for position 4)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, only ruled out for position 2 in TORSE, but position 2 was never forbidden for O)  
Wait—correction: O was placed at position 2 in TORSE and got “-” (meaning O is in the word but not in position 2). So position 2 is actually ruled out for O. I need to avoid that.

Let me re-evaluate.

We need a word that:
- ends with E  
- contains O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4  
- R not in 1 or 4 → R can be 2 or 3  
- S not in 3 or 4 → S can be 1 or 2  
- O not in 2 → O can be 1, 3, or 4  

A valid arrangement satisfying rules:  
S in 1, O in 3, R in 2 → “S O R _ E” → SOR_E → “SORRY” contains Y (disallowed).  
S in 1, O in 4, R in 3 → “S _ R O E” → “SRO_E” → no common word.

Try S in 1, R in 2, O in 3: “S R O _ E” → “SRO_E” again invalid.

Let me try O in 1, R in 2, S in 4 → but S cannot be 4 (from TORSE feedback: S is not in 4).  

Next possibility: O in 1, S in 2, R in 3 → “O S R _ E” → “OSR_E” → “OSPRE” (but that’s 5 letters: OSPRE is not a common word).  

Better choice: “PROSE”  
P (new letter), R, O, S, E.  
- E is fixed at 5 ✓  
- R is at 3 (allowed)  
- S is at 4 (but feedback says S is not in 4) → invalid.

“POSER” ends with R – invalid.

“SORE” is 4 letters – invalid.

“ROSES” ends with S – invalid.

“SOWER” ends with R – invalid.

“RESOW” ends with W – invalid.

“ROUSE” ends with E, but R is 1 (disallowed).

Rechecking: R cannot be 1, S cannot be 3 or 4.  
Let’s list possible positions for O, R, S:

Positions 1-4, E at 5.

Valid placements:
- R can be 2 or 3
- S can be 1 or 2
- O can be 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is free for O because in TORSE O was at 2 and got “-” so 2 is disallowed)

Possible 5-letter words:
- “S O _ R E” → SORRE – invalid.
- “S R O _ E” → SRO E – invalid.
- “O S R _ E” → OSR E – invalid.
- “O _ S R E” → O S R E – need a consonant in position 2.  
  “OUSER” – ends with R – invalid.

Actually, a valid common word is “ROUSE” but R is at 1 (disallowed).  

Another candidate: “CORSE”  
C, O, R, S, E  
- R is at 3 (allowed)  
- S is at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.

Next: “HORSE”  
H, O, R, S, E  
- R at 3 (allowed)  
- S at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.

“MOUSE” – lacks R and S.

“GROSE” – not common.

“FORGE” – lacks S.

“FORCE” – lacks S.

“PERSE” – lacks O, R, S.

“SURGE” – lacks O.

“SCORE” – has S, C, O, R, E  
- S at 1 (allowed)  
- C new  
- O at 3 (allowed)  
- R at 4 – but R cannot be 4 (from RAISE feedback: R was at 1 and got “-”, so 1 is disallowed, but 4 wasn’t tested yet; actually, R was at 1 (RAISE) and 3 (TORSE), and both gave “-”, so R can’t be 1 or 3 (wait, correction: in TORSE R was at 3 and got “-”, so R can’t be 3 either. So R can only be 2.

Re-summarizing:

Ruled positions for each known letter:
- E is fixed at 5  
- R cannot be 1 or 3 (first guess R at 1, second guess R at 3, both “-”) → R must be 2 or 4  
- S cannot be 3 or 4 (first guess S at 4, second guess S at 3, both “-”) → S must be 1 or 2  
- O cannot be 2 (second guess O at 2 got “-”) → O can be 1, 3, or 4  

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O, R, S, with:
- R at 2 or 4  
- S at 1 or 2  
- O at 1, 3, or 4  
- only one R and one S.

Only valid arrangement left:
- S at 1, R at 2, O at 3 or 4  
  That gives word patterns:  
  S R O _ E → SRO E – invalid 4 letters  
  S R _ O E → need consonant: “SR OE” – invalid.

Next arrangement:
- S at 1, O at 3, R at 4 → S _ O R E – need consonant at 2.  
  “SPORE” – S, P, O, R, E  
  - S at 1 (allowed)  
  - O at 3 (allowed)  
  - R at 4 (allowed, because R was only ruled out for 1 and 3)  
  - E at 5 ✓  
  - P is new and harmless.

This fits all constraints: contains O, R, S, E, no forbidden letters, and every letter is in an allowed position.

Therefore, the best next guess is “SPORE”.
</think>

<guess>SPORE</guess>",SPORE,"From both guesses we now know:

Letters already confirmed NOT in the word:  
A, I, T

Letters confirmed to be in the word (but position still unknown):  
O, R, S, E  (with E fixed at position 5)

Known positions:  
E is at position 5.

Letter positions that have been ruled out:
- R cannot be 1 or 4  
- S cannot be 3 or 4  
- O cannot be 2  

So the word must be of the form:  
[?][?][?][?]E  
with O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4 and no repeats of letters already ruled out.

Possible placements:
- R can be 2 or 3
- S can be 1 or 2 (but not 3 or 4)
- O can be 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2)

We still need to test the consonant/vowel pattern that hasn’t been tried yet.

Popular 5-letter words ending in E that contain O, R, S and don’t repeat other excluded letters include: “ROSES” (but ends with S not E), “SORES” (same), “SOWER” (ends with R), “SPORE” (has P). Among valid candidates: “SPORE” fits the pattern.

However, let’s pick a word that places each of the unknown letters in a new, untested position and avoids every ruled-out spot.

A good choice is: “ROOSE”  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, only ruled out for position 4)  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, only ruled out for position 2 in TORSE, but position 2 was never forbidden for O)  
Wait—correction: O was placed at position 2 in TORSE and got “-” (meaning O is in the word but not in position 2). So position 2 is actually ruled out for O. I need to avoid that.

Let me re-evaluate.

We need a word that:
- ends with E  
- contains O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4  
- R not in 1 or 4 → R can be 2 or 3  
- S not in 3 or 4 → S can be 1 or 2  
- O not in 2 → O can be 1, 3, or 4  

A valid arrangement satisfying rules:  
S in 1, O in 3, R in 2 → “S O R _ E” → SOR_E → “SORRY” contains Y (disallowed).  
S in 1, O in 4, R in 3 → “S _ R O E” → “SRO_E” → no common word.

Try S in 1, R in 2, O in 3: “S R O _ E” → “SRO_E” again invalid.

Let me try O in 1, R in 2, S in 4 → but S cannot be 4 (from TORSE feedback: S is not in 4).  

Next possibility: O in 1, S in 2, R in 3 → “O S R _ E” → “OSR_E” → “OSPRE” (but that’s 5 letters: OSPRE is not a common word).  

Better choice: “PROSE”  
P (new letter), R, O, S, E.  
- E is fixed at 5 ✓  
- R is at 3 (allowed)  
- S is at 4 (but feedback says S is not in 4) → invalid.

“POSER” ends with R – invalid.

“SORE” is 4 letters – invalid.

“ROSES” ends with S – invalid.

“SOWER” ends with R – invalid.

“RESOW” ends with W – invalid.

“ROUSE” ends with E, but R is 1 (disallowed).

Rechecking: R cannot be 1, S cannot be 3 or 4.  
Let’s list possible positions for O, R, S:

Positions 1-4, E at 5.

Valid placements:
- R can be 2 or 3
- S can be 1 or 2
- O can be 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is free for O because in TORSE O was at 2 and got “-” so 2 is disallowed)

Possible 5-letter words:
- “S O _ R E” → SORRE – invalid.
- “S R O _ E” → SRO E – invalid.
- “O S R _ E” → OSR E – invalid.
- “O _ S R E” → O S R E – need a consonant in position 2.  
  “OUSER” – ends with R – invalid.

Actually, a valid common word is “ROUSE” but R is at 1 (disallowed).  

Another candidate: “CORSE”  
C, O, R, S, E  
- R is at 3 (allowed)  
- S is at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.

Next: “HORSE”  
H, O, R, S, E  
- R at 3 (allowed)  
- S at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.

“MOUSE” – lacks R and S.

“GROSE” – not common.

“FORGE” – lacks S.

“FORCE” – lacks S.

“PERSE” – lacks O, R, S.

“SURGE” – lacks O.

“SCORE” – has S, C, O, R, E  
- S at 1 (allowed)  
- C new  
- O at 3 (allowed)  
- R at 4 – but R cannot be 4 (from RAISE feedback: R was at 1 and got “-”, so 1 is disallowed, but 4 wasn’t tested yet; actually, R was at 1 (RAISE) and 3 (TORSE), and both gave “-”, so R can’t be 1 or 3 (wait, correction: in TORSE R was at 3 and got “-”, so R can’t be 3 either. So R can only be 2.

Re-summarizing:

Ruled positions for each known letter:
- E is fixed at 5  
- R cannot be 1 or 3 (first guess R at 1, second guess R at 3, both “-”) → R must be 2 or 4  
- S cannot be 3 or 4 (first guess S at 4, second guess S at 3, both “-”) → S must be 1 or 2  
- O cannot be 2 (second guess O at 2 got “-”) → O can be 1, 3, or 4  

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O, R, S, with:
- R at 2 or 4  
- S at 1 or 2  
- O at 1, 3, or 4  
- only one R and one S.

Only valid arrangement left:
- S at 1, R at 2, O at 3 or 4  
  That gives word patterns:  
  S R O _ E → SRO E – invalid 4 letters  
  S R _ O E → need consonant: “SR OE” – invalid.

Next arrangement:
- S at 1, O at 3, R at 4 → S _ O R E – need consonant at 2.  
  “SPORE” – S, P, O, R, E  
  - S at 1 (allowed)  
  - O at 3 (allowed)  
  - R at 4 (allowed, because R was only ruled out for 1 and 3)  
  - E at 5 ✓  
  - P is new and harmless.

This fits all constraints: contains O, R, S, E, no forbidden letters, and every letter is in an allowed position.

Therefore, the best next guess is “SPORE”.",Guess 3: SPORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,score,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters or eliminate many possibilities early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R and S appear somewhere, but not in their previous positions (R≠1, S≠4).
3. The letters A and I are not in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and S.
- Does not contain A or I.

Good candidates:
- ""STORE"" – has S and R, ends with E, but S is in position 4 (invalid since S≠4).
- ""SERVE"" – has S and E, but only one of the required letters (R/S).
- ""ROUSE"" – has R, S, and E, but I is excluded (this is fine since I is excluded).
- ""WORSE"" – has R, S, and E, and positions work (R is 2, S is 4 – but S≠4, so invalid).
- ""CREST"" – doesn't end with E.
- ""GREET"" – no S.
- ""ROSES"" – ends with S, not E.
- ""SPREE"" – has S, P, R, E, E – ends with E, but S is 1st position (allowed), R is 3rd position (allowed), E is 4th and 5th (but 5th must be E, which is correct).

Looking at ""SPREE"":
- S is in 1st position (allowed, since previously S was 4th and marked wrong position, 1st is new).
- P is new.
- R is in 3rd position (allowed, previously R was 1st and marked wrong position, 3rd is new).
- E is in 5th position (matches feedback).

This seems valid, as it tests new positions for S and R while keeping E fixed at the end.

But let's check another candidate: ""ROUSE"":
- R is 1st (invalid, since R≠1 from feedback).
- ""TORSE"":
- T, O, R, S, E: R is 4th (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed), E is 5th (correct), and no A/I. This looks better.

""TORSE"" seems like a strong second guess:
- T, O, R, S, E – no A or I.
- R is 4th (allowed).
- S is 3rd (allowed).
- E is 5th (correct).

This maximizes new information while fitting all constraints.

Letter positions that have been ruled out:
- R cannot be 1 or 4

So the word must be of the form:

Possible placements:
- R can be 2 or 3

We still need to test the consonant/vowel pattern that hasn’t been tried yet.

However, let’s pick a word that places each of the unknown letters in a new, untested position and avoids every ruled-out spot.

A good choice is: “ROOSE”

Wait—correction: O was placed at position 2 in TORSE and got “-” (meaning O is in the word but not in position 2). So position 2 is actually ruled out for O. I need to avoid that.

Let me re-evaluate.

We need a word that:
- ends with E  
- contains O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4  
- R not in 1 or 4 → R can be 2 or 3  
- S not in 3 or 4 → S can be 1 or 2

S in 1, O in 4, R in 3 → “S _ R O E” → “SRO_E” → no common word.

Try S in 1, R in 2, O in 3: “S R O _ E” → “SRO_E” again invalid.

Let me try O in 1, R in 2, S in 4 → but S cannot be 4 (from TORSE feedback: S is not in 4).  

Next possibility: O in 1, S in 2, R in 3 → “O S R _ E” → “OSR_E” → “OSPRE” (but that’s 5 letters: OSPRE is not a common word).  

Better choice: “PROSE”

I need to avoid that.\n\nLet me re-evaluate.\n\nWe need a word that:\n- ends with E  \n- contains O, R, S somewhere in positions 1-4  \n- R not in 1 or 4 → R can be 2 or 3  \n- S not in 3 or 4 → S can be 1 or 2  \n- O not in 2 → O can be 1, 3, or 4  \n\nA valid arrangement satisfying rules:  \nS in 1, O in 3, R in 2 → “S O R _ E” → SOR_E → “SORRY” contains Y (disallowed).  \nS in 1, O in 4, R in 3 → “S _ R O E” → “SRO_E” → no common word.\n\nTry S in 1, R in 2, O in 3: “S R O _ E” → “SRO_E” again invalid.\n\nLet me try O in 1, R in 2, S in 4 → but S cannot be 4 (from TORSE feedback: S is not in 4).  \n\nNext possibility: O in 1, S in 2, R in 3 → “O S R _ E” → “OSR_E” → “OSPRE” (but that’s 5 letters: OSPRE is not a common word).  \n\nBetter choice: “PROSE”  \nP (new letter), R, O, S, E.  \n- E is fixed at 5 ✓  \n- R is at 3 (allowed)  \n- S is at 4 (but feedback says S is not in 4) → invalid.\n\n“POSER” ends with R – invalid.\n\n“SORE” is 4 letters – invalid.\n\n“ROSES” ends with S – invalid.\n\n“SOWER” ends with R – invalid.\n\n“RESOW” ends with W – invalid.\n\n“ROUSE” ends with E, but R is 1 (disallowed).\n\nRechecking: R cannot be 1, S cannot be 3 or 4.  \nLet’s list possible positions for O, R, S:\n\nPositions 1-4, E at 5.\n\nValid placements:\n- R can be 2 or 3\n- S can be 1 or 2\n- O can be 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is free for O because in TORSE O was at 2 and got “-” so 2 is disallowed)\n\nPossible 5-letter words:\n- “S O _ R E” → SORRE – invalid.\n- “S R O _ E” → SRO E – invalid.\n- “O S R _ E” → OSR E – invalid.\n- “O _ S R E” → O S R E – need a consonant in position 2.  \n  “OUSER” – ends with R – invalid.\n\nActually, a valid common word is “ROUSE” but R is at 1 (disallowed).  \n\nAnother candidate: “CORSE”  \nC, O, R, S, E  \n- R is at 3 (allowed)  \n- S is at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.\n\nNext: “HORSE”  \nH, O, R, S, E  \n- R at 3 (allowed)  \n- S at 4 (disallowed) – invalid.\n\n“MOUSE” – lacks R and S.\n\n“GROSE” – not common.\n\n“FORGE” – lacks S.\n\n“FORCE” – lacks S.\n\n“PERSE” – lacks O, R, S.\n\n“SURGE” – lacks O.\n\n“SCORE” – has S, C, O, R, E  \n- S at 1 (allowed)  \n- C new  \n- O at 3 (allowed)  \n- R at 4 – but R cannot be 4 (from RAISE feedback: R was at 1 and got “-”, so 1 is disallowed, but 4 wasn’t tested yet; actually, R was at 1 (RAISE) and 3 (TORSE), and both gave “-”, so R can’t be 1 or 3 (wait, correction: in TORSE R was at 3 and got “-”, so R can’t be 3 either. So R can only be 2.\n\nRe-summarizing:\n\nRuled positions for each known letter:\n- E is fixed at 5  \n- R cannot be 1 or 3 (first guess R at 1, second guess R at 3, both “-”) → R must be 2 or 4  \n- S cannot be 3 or 4 (first guess S at 4, second guess S at 3, both “-”) → S must be 1 or 2  \n- O cannot be 2 (second guess O at 2 got “-”) → O can be 1, 3, or 4  \n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O, R, S, with:\n- R at 2 or 4  \n- S at 1 or 2  \n- O at 1, 3, or 4  \n- only one R and one S.\n\nOnly valid arrangement left:\n- S at 1, R at 2, O at 3 or 4  \n  That gives word patterns:  \n  S R O _ E → SRO E – invalid 4 letters  \n  S R _ O E → need consonant: “SR OE” – invalid.\n\nNext arrangement:\n- S at 1, O at 3, R at 4 → S _ O R E – need consonant at 2.  \n  “SPORE” – S, P, O, R, E  \n  - S at 1 (allowed)  \n  - O at 3 (allowed)  \n  - R at 4 (allowed, because R was only ruled out for 1 and 3)  \n  - E at 5 ✓  \n  - P is new and harmless.\n\nThis fits all constraints: contains O, R, S, E, no forbidden letters, and every letter is in an allowed position.\n\nTherefore, the best next guess is “SPORE”.\n\n<guess>SPORE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: TORSE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) R(-) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: SPORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback on SPORE:

S(✓)  – S is correct and in position 1  
P(x) – P is not in the word at all  
O(✓) – O is correct and in position 3  
R(✓) – R is correct and in position 4  
E(✓) – E is correct and in position 5  

So the word is now fully determined except for position 2, and we know it must be:

S _ O R E

with the blank being any letter that is not A, I, P, T (already eliminated) and that has not yet been tried in position 2.

Looking at common English 5-letter words matching the pattern S _ O R E, the only usual candidate is:

S C O R E

The letter C has not been ruled out (it has never appeared in any guess so far), and it fits perfectly.

Therefore, the correct word is very likely SCORE.
