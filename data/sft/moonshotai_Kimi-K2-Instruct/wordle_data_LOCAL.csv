For my first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some excellent choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E) 
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, CRANE is particularly strong because:
1. C is a very common starting letter in English words
2. R is a high-frequency consonant
3. A and E are the two most common vowels
4. N is also quite common

This combination should give us good coverage of possible letters in most 5-letter words.

The feedback shows:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word contains C and A (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively)
2. The word does NOT contain R, N, or E

Looking at positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be C, R
- Position 2: Cannot be R, A
- Position 3: Cannot be A, N
- Position 4: Cannot be N, E
- Position 5: Cannot be E

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Since C is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need new letters to test. Good candidates would include: L, S, T, I, O, D, M, etc.

A strategic next guess would be:
- Include C (confirmed present) but in a new position
- Include A (confirmed present) but in a new position
- Use entirely new consonants that haven't been tested yet

Possible words: CLOUD, COAST, CLASS, CACTI, etc.

CLOUD seems good because:
1. Uses C in position 1 (but we know C is not in position 1, so this is wrong - my mistake)
2. Actually, since we know C is NOT in position 1, we should place it elsewhere

Let me reconsider. We need:
- C not in position 1
- A not in position 3
- Entirely new letters for other positions

Good options: LATCH (but uses A in position 3 - wrong), SCALP, SCARE (but uses R - already eliminated), SCOLD, etc.

SCALP uses:
- S (new letter)
- C (confirmed present, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed present, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is wrong in position 3! This is wrong)

Let me correct this - A cannot be in position 3. Better options: COAST (but O, S, T new), but C is in position 1 which we know is wrong.

Actually, since C cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 3, a better word would be LACES (but uses E - eliminated), SACKS (but uses S, K new).

Let's try STALK:
- S (new)
- T (new) 
- A (confirmed, now in position 3 - but this violates the feedback!)

I realize my error - A cannot be in position 3. Let me choose a word where A is in position 2, 4, or 5, and C is in positions 2-5.

A better choice would be SCALD:
- S (new)
- C (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3 - again this violates feedback!)

I need to be more careful. Since A cannot be in position 3, let's put it in position 2:
- A in position 2
- C in positions 3-5

Possible words: BACON (but uses N - eliminated), CABIN (uses N - eliminated), CABLE (uses E - eliminated), etc.

Let's try COALS:
- C (position 1 - but we know C cannot be in position 1! This is wrong)

After careful consideration, a good choice is STACY:
- S (new)
- T (new)
- A (position 3 - but this violates feedback!)

I see I'm struggling with placement. Let me choose a word where:
- A is in position 2 or 4 or 5
- C is in positions 2-5
- All other letters are new

Let's choose COAST:
- C (position 1 - but this is wrong since C was - in position 1)

Actually, the - means C is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 is wrong for C.

Let's use C in position 2: SCOOP (but uses O twice and P new), or SCOUT.

SCOUT:
- S (new)
- C (position 2 - new position)
- O (new)
- U (new) 
- T (new)

This tests C in position 2 and gives us 4 new letters.

Based on the feedback that C is in the word (but not first position), A is in the word (but not third position), and R/N/E are not in the word, I'll test C in position 2 along with several new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some excellent choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E) 
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, CRANE is particularly strong because:
1. C is a very common starting letter in English words
2. R is a high-frequency consonant
3. A and E are the two most common vowels
4. N is also quite common

This combination should give us good coverage of possible letters in most 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback shows:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word contains C and A (but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively)
2. The word does NOT contain R, N, or E

Looking at positions:
- Position 1: Cannot be C, R
- Position 2: Cannot be R, A
- Position 3: Cannot be A, N
- Position 4: Cannot be N, E
- Position 5: Cannot be E

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Since C is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need new letters to test. Good candidates would include: L, S, T, I, O, D, M, etc.

A strategic next guess would be:
- Include C (confirmed present) but in a new position
- Include A (confirmed present) but in a new position
- Use entirely new consonants that haven't been tested yet

Possible words: CLOUD, COAST, CLASS, CACTI, etc.

CLOUD seems good because:
1. Uses C in position 1 (but we know C is not in position 1, so this is wrong - my mistake)
2. Actually, since we know C is NOT in position 1, we should place it elsewhere

Let me reconsider. We need:
- C not in position 1
- A not in position 3
- Entirely new letters for other positions

Good options: LATCH (but uses A in position 3 - wrong), SCALP, SCARE (but uses R - already eliminated), SCOLD, etc.

SCALP uses:
- S (new letter)
- C (confirmed present, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed present, now in position 3 - but feedback said A is wrong in position 3! This is wrong)

Let me correct this - A cannot be in position 3. Better options: COAST (but O, S, T new), but C is in position 1 which we know is wrong.

Actually, since C cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 3, a better word would be LACES (but uses E - eliminated), SACKS (but uses S, K new).

Let's try STALK:
- S (new)
- T (new) 
- A (confirmed, now in position 3 - but this violates the feedback!)

I realize my error - A cannot be in position 3. Let me choose a word where A is in position 2, 4, or 5, and C is in positions 2-5.

A better choice would be SCALD:
- S (new)
- C (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3 - again this violates feedback!)

I need to be more careful. Since A cannot be in position 3, let's put it in position 2:
- A in position 2
- C in positions 3-5

Possible words: BACON (but uses N - eliminated), CABIN (uses N - eliminated), CABLE (uses E - eliminated), etc.

Let's try COALS:
- C (position 1 - but we know C cannot be in position 1! This is wrong)

After careful consideration, a good choice is STACY:
- S (new)
- T (new)
- A (position 3 - but this violates feedback!)

I see I'm struggling with placement. Let me choose a word where:
- A is in position 2 or 4 or 5
- C is in positions 2-5
- All other letters are new

Let's choose COAST:
- C (position 1 - but this is wrong since C was - in position 1)

Actually, the - means C is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 is wrong for C.

Let's use C in position 2: SCOOP (but uses O twice and P new), or SCOUT.

SCOUT:
- S (new)
- C (position 2 - new position)
- O (new)
- U (new) 
- T (new)

This tests C in position 2 and gives us 4 new letters.Based on the feedback that C is in the word (but not first position), A is in the word (but not third position), and R/N/E are not in the word, I'll test C in position 2 along with several new letters.
