For my first Wordle guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good opening word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present
3. Have consonants that appear commonly in English words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would combine these.

Some excellent starting words include: ARISE, ADIEU, STARE, ROAST, RAISE. All of these use very common letters.

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowels quickly
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Uses all high-frequency letters
- Is a common word that could potentially be the answer itself

All five letters in ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) are marked **x** (not in the word at all).  
That means the secret word contains none of those five letters.  
We therefore need an opening word that uses completely different letters.

Looking at the remaining common letters in English (excluding A, R, I, S, E), good candidates include:  
- O, U, N, T, L, C, D, Y, P, M, H, etc.

A strong opening word that avoids all of A, R, I, S, E while still using frequent letters is “MOUNT”.  
It gives us:  
- Two vowels (O, U)  
- Three common consonants (M, N, T)  
- No overlap with the eliminated set.

So I’ll guess MOUNT next.

Current information:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, E, M, U, T (from the two guesses).
- Letters we know ARE in the word, but position unknown: O, N.

We have two confirmed letters, O and N, and we need to find positions for them.  
A good next word should place these letters in new spots while introducing fresh letters that are still common.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet:  
- Vowels: Y (sometimes), plus we can check if there’s another O or U (but U is out).  
- Consonants: L, C, D, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, etc.

A solid choice is “LOWLY”.  
- Contains O (which we know is in the word).  
- Contains N (but LOWLY doesn’t have N, so that’s a mistake—let’s revise).

- **N** is in the word but **not** in position 4 (N is marked – at position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).

So the pattern so far is:

2. Place the N in a new spot (1, 2, or 5).  
3. Introduce several fresh letters to test.

“NCOHK” isn’t a valid English word. Let’s swap for valid options.

“CONCH” is valid and fits:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first Wordle guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good opening word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present
3. Have consonants that appear commonly in English words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would combine these.

Some excellent starting words include: ARISE, ADIEU, STARE, ROAST, RAISE. All of these use very common letters.

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowels quickly
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Uses all high-frequency letters
- Is a common word that could potentially be the answer itself

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) are marked **x** (not in the word at all).  
That means the secret word contains none of those five letters.  
We therefore need an opening word that uses completely different letters.

Looking at the remaining common letters in English (excluding A, R, I, S, E), good candidates include:  
- O, U, N, T, L, C, D, Y, P, M, H, etc.

A strong opening word that avoids all of A, R, I, S, E while still using frequent letters is “MOUNT”.  
It gives us:  
- Two vowels (O, U)  
- Three common consonants (M, N, T)  
- No overlap with the eliminated set.

So I’ll guess MOUNT next.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, E, M, U, T (from the two guesses).
- Letters we know ARE in the word, but position unknown: O, N.

We have two confirmed letters, O and N, and we need to find positions for them.  
A good next word should place these letters in new spots while introducing fresh letters that are still common.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet:  
- Vowels: Y (sometimes), plus we can check if there’s another O or U (but U is out).  
- Consonants: L, C, D, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, etc.

A solid choice is “LOWLY”.  
- Contains O (which we know is in the word).  
- Contains N (but LOWLY doesn’t have N, so that’s a mistake—let’s revise).  

Oops, LOWLY lacks N. Let’s pick “POLYP” instead:  
- Has O and N? No, still lacks N.  

Better: “BLOOM” uses O but no N.  

Let’s try “BLOND”:  
- B, L, O, N, D.  
- Includes both O and N in new positions.  
- Uses fresh letters B, L, D.  

This seems optimal.

Step 1: Extract all known facts  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, E, M, U, T, B, L, D, C  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:  
  – K must be at position 1 (✓ at Guess 4)  
  – N must be at position 2 (✓ at Guess 4)  
  – O must be at position 3 (✓ at Guess 4)  
  – The second K (position 5) is in the word but not at position 5 (-). Since K already appears only once at position 1, this means the word has **only one K** and the final letter cannot be K.

So the known pattern is:  
K N O _ _  

Step 2: Determine possible last two letters  
Allowed letters (have not been ruled out): F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Among these, common English letters suitable for positions 4–5 are F, G, H, J, P, W, Y.

Step 3: Find valid 5-letter words matching K N O _ _  
Scanning the English lexicon:  
- KNOFF  – invalid (double F unusual, not listed)  
- KNOBS – has B (ruled out)  
- KNOCK – already tried, ruled out  
- KNOLL – L is ruled out  
- KNOOP – P is allowed but “KNOOP” is rare  
- KNOPS – S is ruled out  
- KNOTS – T, S ruled out  
- KNOUT – U, T ruled out  
- KNOWS – S, W allowed but S is ruled out  
- KNOXY – X is allowed but uncommon  
- KNOBS – again B ruled out  
- KNOFF – again uncommon  
- KNOHY – not a word  
- KNOGY – not a word  
- KNOPH – not a word  

The only remaining common, valid word is **KNOWS** but S is ruled out.  
Rechecking: any other possibilities?  
- KNOXY – too obscure  
- KNOFF – obscure  
- KNOGY – not valid  

Actually, position 4 and 5 together must form a valid digraph with the known prefix.  
The only common English word left is KNOWN.  
Check letters:  
- N appears again at position 5, which is allowed (no duplication rule in Wordle except the single K).  
- W is still allowed.  

“KNOWN” uses N at position 5, which has never been ruled out, and W is still legal.

Hence: KNOWN.

  – The second K (position 5) is in the word but not at position 5 (-). Since K already appears only once at position 1, this means the word has **only one K** and the final letter cannot be K.

So the known pattern is:  
K N O _ _  

Step 2: Determine possible last two letters  
Allowed letters (have not been ruled out): F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Among these, common English letters suitable for positions 4–5 are F, G, H, J, P, W, Y.

Step 3: Find valid 5-letter words matching K N O _ _  
Scanning the English lexicon:  
- KNOFF  – invalid (double F unusual, not listed)  
- KNOBS – has B (ruled out)  
- KNOCK – already tried, ruled out  
- KNOLL – L is ruled out  
- KNOOP – P is allowed but “KNOOP” is rare  
- KNOPS – S is ruled out  
- KNOTS – T, S ruled out  
- KNOUT – U, T ruled out  
- KNOWS – S, W allowed but S is ruled out  
- KNOXY – X is allowed but uncommon  
- KNOBS – again B ruled out  
- KNOFF – again uncommon  
- KNOHY – not a word  
- KNOGY – not a word  
- KNOPH – not a word  

The only remaining common, valid word is **KNOWS** but S is ruled out.  
Rechecking: any other possibilities?  
- KNOXY – too obscure  
- KNOFF – obscure  
- KNOGY – not valid  

Actually, position 4 and 5 together must form a valid digraph with the known prefix.  
The only common English word left is KNOWN.  
Check letters:  
- N appears again at position 5, which is allowed (no duplication rule in Wordle except the single K).  
- W is still allowed.  

“KNOWN” uses N at position 5, which has never been ruled out, and W is still legal.

Hence: KNOWN.",Guess 5: KNOWN -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
