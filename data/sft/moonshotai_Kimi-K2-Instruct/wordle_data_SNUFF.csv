Since this is the first guess and we have no previous information to work from, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and gives us maximum information about the secret word. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C.

A good first guess should contain these common letters while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"" are all excellent choices as they contain 5 unique high-frequency letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all **not** in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So we know:
1. The word must contain the letter S, but **not in position 4**.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are **excluded**.
3. The remaining letters of the alphabet are still possible, but we should focus on ones that haven’t been ruled out.

High-frequency letters that remain possible: T, I, N, L, U, D, G, H, C, M, P, Y, F, K, B, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but many of these are too rare or awkward).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in 4th position).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

A good next guess would be a word like ""SLUIT"" (but that’s not a valid English word), or ""STUMP"" (contains S, T, U, M, P). ""STUMP"" is valid and uses new high-frequency letters (T, U, M, P). However, let’s see if we can do better.

Another good option is ""LUSTY"" (L, U, S, T, Y), but it has S in the 3rd position, which is fine since S can’t be in 4th position anyway.

I’ll go with ""LUSTY"" because it introduces 4 new letters (L, U, T, Y) and keeps S in a new position (3rd), while avoiding all the excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
U (cannot be in 2 or 1), S (cannot be in 2, 3, or 4), N (cannot be in 4).

So:
- The word must contain U, S, N.
- U cannot be in 1 or 2.

- N cannot be in 4.

Allowed letters left (besides U, S, N):

Let's consider possible positions.

We need 5 letters including U, S, N.
S must be in 1 or 5.

Option 1: S _ _ _ _
Then N and U must fit in positions 2,3,5 with U not in 2.
Possible permutations: S N U _ _ or S _ N U _ or S _ _ N U, but must keep letters allowed.

Option 2: _ _ _ _ S
Then U and N must fit in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
U not in 2, N not in 4.

Let's think of a valid word with S in position 1:
S _ _ _ _ with U and N somewhere, and two other allowed letters.

Good candidate: SOUND
Check:
- S (pos 1) - allowed
- O - not allowed (x in AROSE)
Reject.

Next try: S _ U N _ with allowed letters.
SUN _ _ - need two more letters, but word must be 5 letters.

Actually, let's try S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
Then U and N must be in positions 3 and 4 (since 2 is forbidden for U, and 4 is forbidden for N):
So positions: _ N U _ S

Possible word: ""NUDGS"" - invalid
""FUNDS"" - contains F, U, N, D, S
Check:

U - allowed (position 3)
N - allowed (position 2)

No forbidden letters, and meets all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C.

A good first guess should contain these common letters while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"" are all excellent choices as they contain 5 unique high-frequency letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

- A, R, O, E are all **not** in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So we know:
1. The word must contain the letter S, but **not in position 4**.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are **excluded**.
3. The remaining letters of the alphabet are still possible, but we should focus on ones that haven’t been ruled out.

High-frequency letters that remain possible: T, I, N, L, U, D, G, H, C, M, P, Y, F, K, B, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but many of these are too rare or awkward).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (not in 4th position).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, E.
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

A good next guess would be a word like ""SLUIT"" (but that’s not a valid English word), or ""STUMP"" (contains S, T, U, M, P). ""STUMP"" is valid and uses new high-frequency letters (T, U, M, P). However, let’s see if we can do better.

Another good option is ""LUSTY"" (L, U, S, T, Y), but it has S in the 3rd position, which is fine since S can’t be in 4th position anyway.

I’ll go with ""LUSTY"" because it introduces 4 new letters (L, U, T, Y) and keeps S in a new position (3rd), while avoiding all the excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

2. Must contain U (and not in position 2).
3. Cannot contain A, R, O, E, L, T, Y.
4. Other letters are still possible.

Remaining high-frequency letters that are still allowed:

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and U in permissible positions.
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Tries to introduce new letters to narrow the search.

Good candidate letters to add are D, I, N, P, G, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is “USING”:
- U is in position 1 (allowed, since in LUSTY it was in position 2 and got “-”, so position 1 is fine).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since it was excluded from positions 3 and 4).

Guess 1: AROSE → S in position 4 → (-)
Guess 2: LUSTY → S in position 3 → (-)
Guess 3: USING → S in position 2 → (-)
Guess 4: FUNDS → S in position 5 → (-)

S has now been excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5. The only remaining place for S is position 1.

Therefore the word must be S _ _ _ _ and must contain F, U, N in the remaining four positions.

We have:

S _ _ _ _ with F, U, N in positions 2-5 covering three of those four spots, and one more letter.

Letters already ruled out and the remaining allowed letters are: H, C, M, P, K, B, W, V.

Possible words:

S F U N ? → SFUN_ (needs a letter at the end) but SFUNK is not a word.
S F N U ? → SFNU_ → SFNUB, SFNUK, etc. – none are valid.

We need to fit F, U, N into positions 2-5 with one more letter.

Let’s list all permutations of F, U, N plus one allowed letter in positions 2-5 and see which gives a valid English word.

Permutations:

F U N ? → positions 2-5: S F U N _ but we need a fifth letter. The positions are:

S _ _ _ _ with F, U, N in three of 2-5 and one new letter.

Let’s try:

S N U F _ → SNUFF – valid word and contains S, N, U, F plus one F (but F can repeat? Rules don’t forbid it. SNUFF is valid 5-letter word).

Check constraints:

S (position 1) – allowed (never tried here before)
N (position 2) – allowed (was ruled out from 2 and 4, but in FUNDS it was position 3, so 2 is actually allowed? Wait.

Wait, in FUNDS:

F(-) U(-) N(-) D(x) S(-)

So N was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 again. So N can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But position 1 is S.

Positions now for N: 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is now excluded too)

Similarly:

U cannot be in 1 or 2 (from earlier) and in FUNDS U was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2. So U must be in 3,4, or 5.

F was in position 1 in FUNDS, so cannot be in 1 (already S), so F can be in 2,3,4,5.

S must be in position 1.

So possible placements:

S _ _ _ _

With:

- F in 2,3,4,5 (not 1)
- U in 3,4,5 (not 1,2)
- N in 2,4,5 (not 1,3)

Let's try to fit them:

Option:

S F N U ? – need one more letter. Allowed letters: H, C, M, P, K, B, W, V.

S F N U _ → SFNU_ – none of SFNUH, SFNUC, etc. are words.

Option:

S N F U ? → S N F U _ → same issue.

Option:

S _ _ N F – S _ _ N F with U in one of positions 2,3.

S U _ N F → SUNF_ – invalid.

S _ U N F → S _ U N F → need a letter in 2.

S B U N F – SBUNF – invalid.

S C U N F – SCUNF – invalid.

S H U N F – SHUNF – invalid.

S P U N F – SPUNF – invalid.

S W U N F – SWUNF – invalid.

S V U N F – SVUNF – invalid.

S N U _ F → need a letter in 4.

S N U _ F → S N U _ F → need a letter in 4.

Allowed letters: H, C, M, P, K, B, W, V.

S N U B F – invalid.

S N U C F – invalid.

S N U H F – invalid.

 etc., none seem valid.

Another approach: the word must be S _ _ _ _ with F, U, N in positions 2-5 and one more letter.

Valid words that start with S and contain F, U, N:

- SNUFF – contains S, N, U, F, F.

Check if it fits:

S N U F F:

- S in 1 – allowed (never tried)
- N in 2 – allowed (was excluded from 3,4, but 2 is fine)
- U in 3 – allowed (excluded from 1,2, but 3 is fine)
- F in 4 – allowed (excluded from 1, but 4 is fine)
- F in 5 – allowed (not excluded anywhere)

So SNUFF seems valid.

Let me check if there’s any other word. Another candidate is SNUCK (contains S, N, U, C, K) but is missing F, which we know is in the word.

Therefore, the only plausible word is SNUFF.

But wait – SNUFF is a valid word (as in ""snuff film"" or ""tobacco snuff"").

Let me verify all constraints:

- Must contain S, F, U, N – SNUFF has all four.
- S must be in position 1 – yes.
- F cannot be in position 1 – it’s in 4 and 5 – ok.
- U cannot be in 1 or 2 – it’s in 3 – ok.
- N cannot be in 2,3,4 – it’s in 2 – wait, from FUNDS N was in position 3, so it cannot be in 3, but can be in 2,4,5. So N in 2 is allowed.

Thus SNUFF meets all constraints.

</think>

The feedback shows that S, F, U, and N are all in the word, while D is not. S must be in the first position because it has already been ruled out of positions 2-5. The only remaining letter we need is another allowed consonant, and the resulting valid word that fits is:

<guess>SNUFF</guess>",SNUFF,"From Guess 4 (FUNDS) we just got:

F(-) U(-) N(-) D(x) S(-)

That is:

- D is not in the word (x).
- F, U, N, S are all in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word must contain the letters {F, U, N, S} and the fifth letter is still unknown (but not any letter already ruled out).

Letters already ruled out (x): A, R, O, E, L, T, Y, I, G, D.

Allowed additional letters: H, C, M, P, K, B, W, V.

Positions that are now constrained:

- F cannot be in position 1
- U cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4
- S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from earlier feedback and must be in position 1)

Wait, let’s re-check S:

Guess 1: AROSE → S in position 4 → (-)
Guess 2: LUSTY → S in position 3 → (-)
Guess 3: USING → S in position 2 → (-)
Guess 4: FUNDS → S in position 5 → (-)

S has now been excluded from positions 2, 3, 4, 5. The only remaining place for S is position 1.

So N was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 again. So N can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But position 1 is S.

Positions now for N: 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is now excluded too)

Similarly:

U cannot be in 1 or 2 (from earlier) and in FUNDS U was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2. So U must be in 3,4, or 5.
