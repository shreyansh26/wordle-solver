For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to get the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains A, R, O, S, E - which are all common letters in English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE, we know:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 3)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E

We need a new 5-letter word that uses O (avoiding position 3) and avoids A, R, S, E. Good consonants to try now are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Vowels could include I, U.

Let me think of a word: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. But this has O in position 2 which is okay since we know it's not in position 3. Also avoids all the banned letters.

Another option: ""COUNT"" - but this has O in position 2 and uses C, O, U, N, T. However, U might be too speculative.

""JOINT"" - but J is less common and we already have O.

""CLOUD"" - but has U and D, and O is in position 2.

I think ""POINT"" is a good next choice as it tests O (in position 2), plus common letters P, I, N, T.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, R, S, E (from AROSE)
- P, T (from POINT)

Letters that ARE in the word (but each is in the wrong position so far):
- O – it is in the word, but NOT in position 3 or position 2.
- I – it is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- N – it is in the word, but NOT in position 4.

So the hidden word:
1. Must contain O, I, N.
2. O cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.
3. I cannot be in 3rd position.
4. N cannot be in 4th position.
5. Must avoid A, R, S, E, P, T.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We still need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding the forbidden ones). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple approach is to make a word that places O, I, N in new positions and adds two new consonants. Trying “COBIX” – but C is okay, B and X are okay, but O is 2nd (forbidden) and I is 3rd (forbidden) – no good.

Try “IONIC” – but we don’t know C yet, and O would be 2nd (forbidden).

Try “DONIC” – O is 2nd (forbidden).

Try “CONIC” – same issue.

How about “FOILN” – but this is not a valid word.

Let’s try “DINGO” – O is 5th (allowed), I is 2nd (allowed), N is 3rd (allowed), but G is untested and D is untested. This is a valid word.

Another option: “MOUND” – but D is untested and U is untested, but O is 2nd (forbidden).

“WOUND” – same issue with O.

“NOVIO” – O is 4th (allowed), I is 5th (allowed), N is 1st (allowed). This uses V and O again, but O is already known. V is new.

“NOVIO” is a bit obscure, but it’s valid.

Let’s pick a more common word: “DINGO” fits the constraints and is common.

But DINGO has N in 3rd position, which is allowed (N not in 4th). I is 2nd (allowed). O is 5th (allowed). D and G are new letters, which is fine.

So: D I N G O – valid and fits all constraints.

Good consonants to try now are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Vowels could include I, U.\n\nLet me think of a word: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. But this has O in position 2 which is okay since we know it\'s not in position 3. Also avoids all the banned letters.\n\nAnother option: ""COUNT"" - but this has O in position 2 and uses C, O, U, N, T. However, U might be too speculative.\n\n""JOINT"" - but J is less common and we already have O.\n\n""CLOUD"" - but has U and D, and O is in position 2.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good next choice as it tests O (in position 2), plus common letters P, I, N, T.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary of what we now know:\n\nLetters that are NOT in the word:\n- A, R, S, E (from AROSE)\n- P, T (from POINT)\n\nLetters that ARE in the word (but each is in the wrong position so far):\n- O – it is in the word, but NOT in position 3 or position 2.\n- I – it is in the word, but NOT in position 3.\n- N – it is in the word, but NOT in position 4.\n\nSo the hidden word:\n1.

This uses V and O again, but O is already known. V is new.\n\n“NOVIO” is a bit obscure, but it’s valid.\n\nLet’s pick a more common word: “DINGO” fits the constraints and is common.\n\nBut DINGO has N in 3rd position, which is allowed (N not in 4th).

From the feedback on DINGO we now know:

- D is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- N is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → position 3
- G is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → position 4
- O is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → position 5

So the word looks like: _ I N G O

We just need to determine the first letter. The first letter must:
1. NOT be any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, T, D
2. Be a valid English word when combined with ""INGO""

Common 5-letter words that end in ""INGO"":
- LINGO
- MINGO (not a standard word)
- WINGO (rare)
- KINGO (not standard)
- ZINGO (not standard)

The most common and valid word is ""LINGO"".

Let's check constraints:
- L has not been tested yet (not in the forbidden list)
- Fits the pattern: _ I N G O

So ""LINGO"" should be the correct word.
