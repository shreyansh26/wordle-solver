1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. The word ""AROSE"" is a good starting choice because:
1. It contains all five vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants (R, S)
2. These letters are among the most frequent in English words
3. It's a valid 5-letter word
4. The letter distribution (A, R, O, S, E) gives good coverage for initial elimination

This will help me quickly determine which vowels are present and potentially identify some consonants from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. _ R _ _ _
2. Contains E but E ≠ 5th letter ⇒ E could be in positions 1, 3, 4
3. No A, O, S

Common consonants still worth trying: T, N, L, C, D, P, etc.
Good vowel candidates left: I, U (only if needed; E is already confirmed).

Since we need to keep R in position 2 and place E somewhere else, a simple next probe is to place E early and try fresh consonants around it.  
Word “TREND” fits:
- R in position 2 ✓  
- E in position 3 (allowed) ✓  
- Uses fresh consonants T, N, D (none of which are A, O, S)  
- Uses fresh vowel N/A (only E so far)  
- It’s a valid word.
