For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify as many correct letters as possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

One of the most effective starting words according to word game strategies is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters or positions right away.

From the two guesses:

1. SLATE → S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
   - E is present but not in position 5.

2. REIGN → R(-), E(-), I(x), G(x), N(-)  
   - E is present but not in position 2.  
   - R and N are present but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.  
   - I and G are not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, I, G.

Letters we know ARE in the word: E, R, N.

Positions ruled out:
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5.
- R cannot be in position 1.
- N cannot be in position 5.

We still need to test other common letters like O, U, D, C, P, M, B, etc., while placing E, R, N in possible positions.

Let’s try a word that:
- Contains E, R, N (all known to be in the word).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids positions 1 for R and 5 for E/N.

A word like “CRONE” comes to mind:
- C (new letter)
- R (known, now in position 2)
- O (new letter)
- N (known, now in position 4)
- E (known, now in position 5 – but we know E can’t be in 5, so this is bad)

Oops, E can’t be in position 5, so CRONE is invalid.

Next option: “OWNER”
- O (new)
- W (new)
- N (known, now in position 3)
- E (known, now in position 4)
- R (known, now in position 5 – but R can’t be in position 5, since in REIGN it was “-” in position 5, meaning R is in the word but not in position 5. So this is fine.)

But OWNER has E in position 4, which is allowed.

But let’s check if OWNER violates any constraints:
- R is in position 5 – but in REIGN, R was “-” in position 1, meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. There’s no info against R being in position 5. So OWNER is possible.

But let’s see if we can do better – ideally placing E not in position 4 either (since it was “-” in position 2 in REIGN, but no info against 4 yet).

A better word might be “NERVE”:
- N (known, position 1 – allowed, since we only know N is not in position 5)
- E (known, position 2 – but E was “-” in position 2 in REIGN, so E cannot be in position 2. Thus NERVE is invalid.)

Next: “RENEW”
- R (position 1 – but in REIGN, R was “-” in position 1, so R cannot be in position 1. Invalid.)

Next: “URBEN” – not a valid English word.

“UNDER”:
- U (new)
- N (known, position 2)
- D (new)
- E (known, position 4)
- R (known, position 5)

Check constraints:
- E is not in 2 or 5 – here it’s in 4, ok.
- N is not in 5 – here it’s in 2, ok.
- R is not in 1 – here it’s in 5, ok (no info against 5).

UNDER seems valid.

But let’s see if we can test more new letters. Another option is “HORNE”:
- H (new)
- O (new)
- R (known, position 3)
- N (known, position 4)
- E (known, position 5 – but E cannot be in 5. Invalid.)

“CHURN” – no E, invalid.

- O (new)

“DROWN” – no E, invalid.

“CRANE” – E in 5, invalid.

“FROND” – no E, invalid.

“CREPE” – E in 3 and 5 – 5 is invalid.

“BENCH” – no R, invalid.

“NERDY” – no R in correct position info.

“ENTRY”:
- E (position 1 – no info against it)
- N (position 2 – ok)
- T (already excluded from SLATE)
- R (position 4 – ok)
- Y (new)

But T is excluded, so ENTRY is invalid.

“DINER”:
- D (new)
- I (excluded, from REIGN)
- N (position 3 – ok)
- E (position 4 – ok)
- R (position 5 – ok)

I is excluded, so invalid.

“HONEY”:
- H (new)
- O (new)
- N (position 3 – ok)
- E (position 4 – ok)
- Y (new)

No R, but we know R is in the word, so this is bad.

“CORNE” – E in 5, invalid.

“PURNE” – not a word.

Best remaining seems “UNDER”:
- U (new)
- N (position 2)
- D (new)
- E (position 4)

Checks:
- E is not in 2 or 5 – here in 4, ok.

This seems the best available.
