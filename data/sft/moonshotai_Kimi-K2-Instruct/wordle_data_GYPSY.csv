For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify patterns. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some good options are:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it contains some of the most common letters in English (E, A, R, N, C) and should give good information about the presence/absence of these letters.

The feedback for CRANE shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all. Since these are all very common letters, this is useful information.

From the first two guesses:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
- STOMP: T, O, M are absent; S and P are present but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:

- Letters that must appear somewhere: S, P.

We also know:
- S is NOT in position 1.
- P is NOT in position 5.

Next, I want a word that
1. contains BOTH S and P (to confirm positions),
2. uses only letters that have not been ruled out,
3. avoids the known-wrong positions for S and P.

Good unused letters that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A word that fits: SPICY – but Y is less common and I is untested.

Better: PLUSH – but L, U, H are untested and P is in 1st which was allowed (only 5th was excluded).

Another: SWIFT – S, W, I, F, T – but T is already excluded.

- P is allowed in position 1 (only position 5 was excluded).
- S is allowed in position 2 (position 1 excluded).

We need a 5-letter word where:

Candidate words:

- PUPS → U already absent
- WISP_S → WISPS (but S is already confirmed in 4th)
- YIPS → too short
- GIPSY – P in 2nd, S in 4th, letters G, I, Y all allowed

GIPSY satisfies:
- G, I, P, S, Y are all allowed
- S is in the 4th spot (✓ from feedback)
- P is in the 2nd spot (allowed because P is only excluded from 1st and 5th)
- Uses new letters G, I, Y to maximize information

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify patterns. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some good options are:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it contains some of the most common letters in English (E, A, R, N, C) and should give good information about the presence/absence of these letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for CRANE shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all. Since these are all very common letters, this is useful information. To maximize the chance of hitting at least some correct letters in my second guess, I should now choose a word that uses a completely different set of common letters. Good candidates would include:

- SPOIL (S, P, O, I, L)
- DOUGH (D, O, U, G, H)
- SLUMS (S, L, U, M, S) – but this repeats S, not ideal
- MIGHT (M, I, G, H, T)
- STOMP (S, T, O, M, P)

I'll pick STOMP because it uses S, T, O, M, P – none of which were in CRANE and which are all fairly common letters. This should help me quickly determine which of these letters are present.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first two guesses:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
- STOMP: T, O, M are absent; S and P are present but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters that cannot appear anywhere: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: S, P.

We also know:
- S is NOT in position 1.
- P is NOT in position 5.

Next, I want a word that
1. contains BOTH S and P (to confirm positions),
2. uses only letters that have not been ruled out,
3. avoids the known-wrong positions for S and P.

Good unused letters that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A word that fits: SPICY – but Y is less common and I is untested.

Better: PLUSH – but L, U, H are untested and P is in 1st which was allowed (only 5th was excluded).

Another: SWIFT – S, W, I, F, T – but T is already excluded.

Let’s pick PLUSH:
- P is allowed in position 1 (only position 5 was excluded).
- S is allowed in position 2 (position 1 excluded).
- L, U, H are new letters.

This will test:
- P in position 1.
- S in position 2.
- L, U, H as new letters.

The latest feedback tells us:

- The 1st letter is G
- The 3rd letter is P
- The 4th letter is S
- The 5th letter is Y
- The 2nd letter is NOT I (because I got “x”)

So we have the pattern: G _ P S Y with the blank (2nd position) still unknown.

From earlier rounds we already know which letters are impossible (C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M, L, U, H, I), so the only remaining eligible letters are among B, D, F, J, K, V, W, Z.

Plugging each into the blank:

- B → G B P S Y → GBP is not a common start, but the word must be 5 letters and valid.
- D → G D P S Y → GDPSY – not a recognized word.
- F → G F P S Y – not a word.
- J → G J P S Y – not a word.
- K → G K P S Y – not a word.
- V → G V P S Y – not a word.
- W → G W P S Y – not a word.
- Z → G Z P S Y – not a word.

None of these produce valid English words. This implies the only possible letter for position 2 must be one we have not explicitly excluded. Looking back, we did not test D yet, but the combination G _ P S Y with D gives the word “G D P S Y”. However, “G D P S Y” is not in common English dictionaries.

Double-checking the feedback: we have 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th letters confirmed, and only the 2nd letter left. The only 5-letter word that fits the pattern G _ P S Y is **GUPSY**, but “U” was ruled out by PLUSH feedback.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback:

PLUSH → positions: P L U S H  
Feedback: P(-) L(x) U(x) S(✓) H(x)

So U is in fact ruled out, as is H.

The only remaining candidate letters are B, D, F, J, K, V, W, Z. None of these form a valid word with the pattern G _ P S Y.

This suggests an inconsistency; however, one valid word that uses the exact confirmed pattern **G _ P S Y** is **GYPSY**, but Y is already in the 5th position and GYPSY has Y in both 2nd and 5th – invalid because Y cannot repeat.

Wait, let’s re-examine: the word must be **G _ P S Y** with the middle letter not I and must be a valid word. The only standard English word that fits this exact pattern is **GYPSY**, but it has Y in position 2 and 5, making the 2nd letter Y, which has not been excluded (only I was excluded in position 2). GYPSY has:

- Position 1: G (✓ matches feedback)
- Position 2: Y (not excluded)
- Position 3: P (✓ matches feedback)
- Position 4: S (✓ matches feedback)
- Position 5: Y (✓ matches feedback)

Thus, the only valid word that matches the confirmed pattern is **GYPSY**.

Therefore, the correct word is GYPSY.
