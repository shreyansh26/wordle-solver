For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a high chance of revealing useful information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are often good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE,"" but I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes multiple common vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S).

""ARISE"" is a good balance because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E), which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S), which are frequently found in English words.
- It's a valid 5-letter word, so it meets the game's requirements.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- R is confirmed in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

So the word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _

I want a word that keeps R in the second spot and avoids A, I, S, E entirely. Common consonants like T, N, L, B, D, C and vowels like O and U (since E and A are out) are good choices.

A common pattern that follows _ R _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is ""TROOP"", but O is repeated and that seems wasteful. Another option is ""BROTH"" – but H might be too uncommon. ""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y – avoiding forbidden letters and keeping R in position 2. 

I'll go with CRONY because it introduces several new letters to test.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,croup,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a high chance of revealing useful information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are often good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE,"" but I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes multiple common vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S).

""ARISE"" is a good balance because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E), which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S), which are frequently found in English words.
- It's a valid 5-letter word, so it meets the game's requirements.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:

- R is confirmed in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

So the word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _

I want a word that keeps R in the second spot and avoids A, I, S, E entirely. Common consonants like T, N, L, B, D, C and vowels like O and U (since E and A are out) are good choices.

A common pattern that follows _ R _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is ""TROOP"", but O is repeated and that seems wasteful. Another option is ""BROTH"" – but H might be too uncommon. ""CRONY"" uses C, R, O, N, Y – avoiding forbidden letters and keeping R in position 2. 

I'll go with CRONY because it introduces several new letters to test.

The most promising is CROWD: C R O W D.

A common 5-letter word beginning with CRO and using only untested letters is “CROMB,” but that’s obscure.  
Another possibility is “CROCK,” but it repeats the C (already known) and doesn’t test new letters.

The only reasonable word left appears to be “CROCK,” but since we know C is already in position 1 and positions 4-5 are still unknown, we need another valid word. 

Let’s consider “CROUP” – but P and U are still allowed.  
Check the letters: C (✓), R (✓), O (✓), U (new), P (new).  
None of these letters are in the forbidden list.
