For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good first guess should include frequently used letters in English, such as A, E, I, O, T, R, N, S, L, etc. 

Popular opening words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), providing good coverage for elimination and placement discovery.

From the first guess (CRANE):
- C, R are completely out.  
- E is confirmed in the 5th position.  
- A is somewhere in the word but not in position 2.  
- N is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ E  
Letters to use: A, N plus other common letters (avoid C, R).  
Good second guesses should test new consonants and the placement of A and N.  
The word “SLANT” includes S, L, N, A, T and places A in a new spot while moving N around.  
Let me check:  
- S, L, T are fresh.  
- A will be in position 3, N in position 4 (both allowed by the feedback).  

Hence, SLANT looks like a strong second guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Known letters:
   - E is definitely in the 5th (last) position → _ _ _ _ E  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 4 (from SLANT) → N could be 1, 2, or 3.  
   - Letters ruled out so far: C, R, S, L, T.

2. Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

3. We have one vowel (A) placed somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4 and one vowel already fixed at 5 (E).  We may still have I, O, or U as additional vowels or consonants to fill remaining spots.

4. We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes both A and N (with A not in spot 2 or 3 and N not in spots 4 or 5).  Also must use only letters not ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- A N _ _ E  → but N in spot 2 is allowed.  Example: ANIME → uses I, M, all allowed.  
- N A _ _ E  → A in spot 2 is NOT allowed (feedback says A not in 2).  
- _ A N _ E → A in 2 and N in 3 → A not in 2, so this is invalid.  
- _ _ A N E → A in 3 (invalid, A not in 3)  
- N _ A _ E → N in 1, A in 3 (invalid)  

Only viable placement I see that fits constraints is: A N _ _ E.

Word that fits: ANIME  
- A in 1 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), I, M unused, E in 5 (confirmed).  
- Check if ANIME is a valid 5-letter English word — yes, it is (Japanese animation).

Summary of everything we know so far:

1. Fixed letters:  
   - E is in position 5: _ _ _ _ E  

2. Letters that are in the word but not yet pinned down:  
   - A (not in positions 1, 2, or 3)  
   - N (not in positions 2, 4, or 5)  
   - I (confirmed in the word, but position unknown)

3. Letters that are out: C, R, S, L, T, M  

4. Remaining unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
   Remaining unused vowels: O, U  

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3, the only place left for A is position 4:  
_ _ _ A E

N must then fit into one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).  
I must also fit into one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are taken by A and E).

So the pattern is either:
- N _ I A E  
- I _ N A E  
- N I _ A E  
- I N _ A E  
etc., but we need a valid 5-letter English word.

A quick scan of English words ending in “AE” is rare; in fact, practically none do. That tells me our assumption that A is in position 4 is likely wrong, but feedback clearly says A is in the word and NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3, so 4 is the only possible spot. This indicates the word must end in “AE” — the only common such word is “ELATE,” but the “AE” isn’t at the end.

Wait! I see the issue: I misread. The feedback for ANIME was:
A(-) N(-) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)

The dash (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.  
So:

- A(-) → A is in the word, but NOT at position 1.  
- N(-) → N is in the word, but NOT at position 2.  
- I(✓) → I is in the word at position 3.  
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word at position 5.

So updated facts:

1. Fixed letters:  
   - I at position 3: _ _ I _ E  
   - E at position 5: _ _ I _ E  

2. Letters in the word, but positions unknown:  
   - A (not at position 1)  
   - N (not at position 2)  

3. Letters ruled out: C, R, S, L, T, M  

Now, the pattern is: _ _ I _ E  
A and N must fit in positions 1, 2, or 4 with the constraints above.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be at 1 → could be 2 or 4  
- N cannot be at 2 → could be 1 or 4  

Let’s list valid combinations:

1. A at 2, N at 1 or 4  
   - N A I _ E → but N at 1, A at 2: word is N A I _ E. The missing letter (position 4) must be from unused letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y). Possible words: NAIDE? no, NAIPE? no, NAIKE? no… seems none.  
   - _ A I N E → fits pattern, needs position 1 letter. Letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y.  
     - D A I N E → valid word “DAINE”? No, not a standard word.  
     - P A I N E → “PAINE” is a surname, but not common.  
     - G A I N E → “GAINE” is archaic.  
     - B A I N E → “BAINE” obsolete.  
     - F A I N E → “FAINE” not a word.  
   None look good.

2. A at 4, N at 1 or 2  
   - N _ I A E → N at 1, position 2 open. Needs a consonant from remaining.  
     - N D I A E → “NDIAE” no.  
     - N B I A E → “NBIAE” no.  
   - _ N I A E → N at 2 (but N cannot be at 2, per feedback).  

3. Both A and N must fit into remaining spots. The only remaining possibility is that the word is “DINAE” — but that’s not standard.

Hmm, looks like I missed an obvious word:  
“NAIVE” has N, A, I, V, E — but I is at 3, E at 5. Let’s check constraints:

- N at 1 (allowed)  
- A at 2 (allowed, since A(-) only forbade position 1)  
- I at 3 (matches ✓)  
- V at 4 (unused letter)  
- E at 5 (matches ✓)  

But N(-) in ANIME says N is not at position 2 — here N is at 1, which is allowed.  
A(-) in ANIME says A is not at 1 — here A is at 2, allowed.  
All other letters unused or confirmed.  

“NAIVE” is a valid English word. Let’s try it.
