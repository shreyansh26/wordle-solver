Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and covering as much of the alphabet as possible. Good starting words often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is NOT in the word (x).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.
- The letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

This eliminates a lot of common letters. To maximize new information, I should now choose a word that:
1. Still uses E (since we know it's in the word somewhere else).
2. Introduces new common letters that weren't in SLATE (like R, N, I, O, U, etc.).
3. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

Good candidates would be words like ""ROUGE"", ""PRUNE"", ""CRIME"", etc. I'll go with ""ROUGE"" because it:
- Uses E (which we know is in the word, and places it in position 5 to test if it can be there - though feedback said position 5 was wrong for E, so this might not be optimal).
- Actually, since E was marked wrong in position 5, I should place E elsewhere. Let me reconsider.

Better choices would be ""REIGN"" (E in position 2) or ""NERVE"" (E in positions 2 and 5, but 5 is known wrong). ""REIGN"" seems better as it places E in position 2 and introduces R, I, G, N.

But ""REIGN"" uses G which is less common. ""CRONE"" might be better, using common letters C, R, O, N, E with E in position 5 (but we know E isn't in position 5). 

Actually, since E cannot be in position 5, let me choose ""CRANE"" - it has E in position 4, which wasn't tested yet, and introduces C, R, N which are common.

Wait, A is already eliminated from SLATE. So ""CRANE"" won't work (contains A).

Better choice: ""CRIME"" - C, R, I, M, E. None of these letters were in SLATE except E, and E is placed in position 4.

Or ""DRIVE"" - D, R, I, V, E. Also good.

I'll go with ""CRIME"" as it uses very common letters and places E in position 4.

Better choices would be ""REIGN"" (E in position 2) or ""NERVE"" (E in positions 2 and 5, but 5 is known wrong). ""REIGN"" seems better as it places E in position 2 and introduces R, I, G, N.

But ""REIGN"" uses G which is less common. ""CRONE"" might be better, using common letters C, R, O, N, E with E in position 5 (but we know E isn't in position 5). 

Actually, since E cannot be in position 5, let me choose ""CRANE"" - it has E in position 4, which wasn't tested yet, and introduces C, R, N which are common.

Wait, A is already eliminated from SLATE. So ""CRANE"" won't work (contains A).

Better choice: ""CRIME"" - C, R, I, M, E. None of these letters were in SLATE except E, and E is placed in position 4.

Or ""DRIVE"" - D, R, I, V, E. Also good.

I'll go with ""CRIME"" as it uses very common letters and places E in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) I(x) M(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   – Eliminate S, L, A, T entirely.
   – E is present but NOT in positions 2 or 5.

2. CRIME: C(-) R(x) I(x) M(x) E(-)
   – Eliminate R, I, M entirely.
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – E is again confirmed to be in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, R, I, M.

Letters we know ARE in the word: C (somewhere but not position 1), E (somewhere but not positions 2 or 5).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and E.
- Has C not in position 1 and E not in positions 2 or 5.
- None of the letters S, L, A, T, R, I, M appear.

A straightforward candidate is “OUNCE”:
- It has C and E.
- C is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 – but feedback already says E cannot be in position 5, so OUNCE is invalid.

Next, “DUNCE”:
- D, U, N, C, E.
- C is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 – again invalid.

We need E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Try “EPOCH”:
- E, P, O, C, H.
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- C in position 4 (allowed).
- None of the forbidden letters appear.

Another check: “EPOXY” has X and Y (less common), so EPOCH seems safer.

Therefore, EPOCH is the best next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Good starting words often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)

- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.

We now know the word has the form _ _ _ C H and must contain E, but E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
That leaves only position 3 for E, giving the exact pattern _ E C H.  

We still need a single-letter prefix from the remaining, never-eliminated consonants:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, N, V, W, Y, Z (Q was used and not marked correct, so we can drop it).

Valid 5-letter English words fitting B E C H, D E C H, F E C H, …:
