For the first guess, I need a 5-letter word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good choices include words with vowels and common consonants like 'A', 'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', etc.

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E - covers common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E - similar reasoning)
- AROSE (A,R,O,S,E - good vowel coverage)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E - another strong choice)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) covering different positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give me good information about vowels and common consonants in the first try.

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5 (fixed)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - R, A, S are absent

2. MINCE → M(x) I(✓) N(x) C(✓) E(✓)
   - I is in position 2 (confirmed)
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - E is again confirmed in position 5
   - M, N are absent

Therefore the secret word:
- Ends with E
- Has I in position 2
- Has C somewhere (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain: R, A, S, M, N

So the pattern looks like: _ I _ _ E, with C somewhere among positions 3 or 5. But position 5 is already E, so C must be in position 3.

Thus the skeleton is: _ I C _ E

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? I C ? E with no letters {R,A,S,M,N}. The missing letters can be from {B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, etc.

Possible candidates (checking Scrabble list):
- B I C K E (bicek – not a valid word)
- D I C K E (dicek – not valid)
- F I C K E (ficek – not valid)
- H I C K E (hicke – not valid)
- P I C K E (picke – not valid)
- T I C K E (ticke – not valid)
Wait, let me think of actual words.

Real words of form ? I C ? E:
- D I C E ? – dicee – no
- P I C K E – no
- L I C K E – no
- F I C H E – fiche (a valid word, a microfilm card)
- L I C H E – liche – archaic form, less common
- W I C K E – wicke – archaic variant of “wick”, not standard
- T I C K E – ticke – not standard
- G I C H E – giche – not a word

FICHE seems to be the only valid 5-letter word matching _ I C _ E and avoiding banned letters.

But let’s double-check:
F I C H E
- F, I, C, H, E
- No R, A, S, M, N

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good choices include words with vowels and common consonants like 'A', 'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', etc.

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E - covers common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E - similar reasoning)
- AROSE (A,R,O,S,E - good vowel coverage)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E - another strong choice)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) covering different positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give me good information about vowels and common consonants in the first try.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

R(x) – no R anywhere
A(x) – no A anywhere
I(-) – I is in the word, wrong position
S(x) – no S anywhere
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- ends with E
- contains I somewhere not in the 3rd position
- does NOT contain R, A, or S

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, C, D, P, B, etc.
Good vowels: we already know E is fixed and I is present; O and U are still possible.

I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses I in a different position (1st, 2nd, or 4th)
3. Avoids R, A, S
4. Introduces new common consonants

Candidate guesses:
- T I M E D → ends with D, not E
- L I N E T → ends with T, not E
- N I T E ? – but we need 5 letters ending in E
- P I N E ? – 4 letters
- B I K E ? – 4 letters
Wait, need 5 letters that end in E. Let me think systematically:

T I M E  is 4 letters – need one more letter.  
How about “T I M E” with an extra consonant or vowel:  
M I T E R ends in R, not E.  
W I N T E – no.  
I need valid 5-letter words ending in E.

Words ending in E, with I somewhere else, exclude R/A/S:

- P I N E D – no, ends in D.  
- T I N E – 4 letters  
- M I N C E – ends E, has I, no R/A/S  
- L I C E – 4 letters  
- B I N G E – ends E, has I, no R/A/S  

Let me pick M I N C E: positions: 1=M, 2=I, 3=N, 4=C, 5=E.

Check:
- ends with E ✓
- contains I in position 2 (will test if it's correct)
- avoids R, A, S ✓
- introduces M, N, C as new consonants ✓

Another good candidate: B I N G E – same structure.

Between these, M I N C E is slightly more common.

Guess 2: MINCE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(x) C(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5 (fixed)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - R, A, S are absent

2. MINCE → M(x) I(✓) N(x) C(✓) E(✓)
   - I is in position 2 (confirmed)
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - E is again confirmed in position 5
   - M, N are absent

Therefore the secret word:
- Ends with E
- Has I in position 2
- Has C somewhere (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain: R, A, S, M, N

So the pattern looks like: _ I _ _ E, with C somewhere among positions 3 or 5. But position 5 is already E, so C must be in position 3.

Thus the skeleton is: _ I C _ E

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? I C ? E with no letters {R,A,S,M,N}. The missing letters can be from {B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, etc.

Possible candidates (checking Scrabble list):
- B I C K E (bicek – not a valid word)
- D I C K E (dicek – not valid)
- F I C K E (ficek – not valid)
- H I C K E (hicke – not valid)
- P I C K E (picke – not valid)
- T I C K E (ticke – not valid)
Wait, let me think of actual words.

Real words of form ? I C ? E:
- D I C E ? – dicee – no
- P I C K E – no
- L I C K E – no
- F I C H E – fiche (a valid word, a microfilm card)
- L I C H E – liche – archaic form, less common
- W I C K E – wicke – archaic variant of “wick”, not standard
- T I C K E – ticke – not standard
- G I C H E – giche – not a word

FICHE seems to be the only valid 5-letter word matching _ I C _ E and avoiding banned letters.

But let’s double-check:
F I C H E
- F, I, C, H, E
- No R, A, S, M, N
- I in position 2 ✓
- C in position 3 ✓
- Ends with E ✓
- All letters known or allowed

- I is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- H and F are not in the word at all.

Forbidden letters so far: R, A, S, M, N, F, H

Current skeleton: _ I _ _ E, with C somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 3), so C must be in position 1 or 4.

So we have two patterns:
1. C I _ _ E
2. _ I _ C E

We need a valid 5-letter word matching either pattern, using only letters not yet excluded: {B, D, G, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus vowels {U, O, E, I} (E and I are already placed).

Possible candidates:

Pattern C I _ _ E:
- C I D G E – cidg-e? Not a word.
- C I P P E – cippe? Not a word.
- C I T T E – citte? Not a word.
- C I K E ? – need 5 letters. CIKEE? No.

Pattern _ I _ C E:
- V I C E ? – vic-e is 4 letters.
- P I C E ? – pice is 4 letters.
- L I C E ? – lice is 4 letters.

Hmm, maybe _ I C _ E but C not in position 3 – but earlier we saw FICHE had C in 3 and feedback was C(-) (wrong position), so C is not in 3.

Wait, let's re-express:

From FICHE feedback:
- C is NOT in position 3 (C(-) means wrong position)
- So C must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me list valid English 5-letter words fitting:
- C I _ _ E: CIDER (but has D and R; R is forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIGAR (A and R forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIVET (T allowed, V allowed, but CIVET has T in 4th, E in 5th)
- CIVET: C, I, V, E, T – check letters:
   - C (allowed), I (position 2 ✓), V (allowed), E (position 5 ✓), T (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters R, A, S, M, N, F, H
   - C is in position 1, which is allowed (since C just can't be in 3)

CIVET seems valid.

Alternative _ I _ C E:

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? I C ? E with no letters {R,A,S,M,N}. The missing letters can be from {B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z}.

Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, etc.

Possible candidates (checking Scrabble list):
- B I C K E (bicek – not a valid word)
- D I C K E (dicek – not valid)
- F I C K E (ficek – not valid)
- H I C K E (hicke – not valid)
- P I C K E (picke – not valid)
- T I C K E (ticke – not valid)
Wait, let me think of actual words.

Real words of form ? I C ? E:
- D I C E ? – dicee – no
- P I C K E – no
- L I C K E – no
- F I C H E – fiche (a valid word, a microfilm card)
- L I C H E – liche – archaic form, less common
- W I C K E – wicke – archaic variant of “wick”, not standard
- T I C K E – ticke – not standard
- G I C H E – giche – not a word

FICHE seems to be the only valid 5-letter word matching _ I C _ E and avoiding banned letters.

But let’s double-check:
F I C H E
- F, I, C, H, E
- No R, A, S, M, N
- I in position 2 ✓
- C in position 3 ✓
- Ends with E ✓
- All letters known or allowed

So FICHE is the best next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

Guess 3: FICHE → F(x) I(✓) C(-) H(x) E(✓)

- I is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- H and F are not in the word at all.

Forbidden letters so far: R, A, S, M, N, F, H

Current skeleton: _ I _ _ E, with C somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 3), so C must be in position 1 or 4.

So we have two patterns:
1. C I _ _ E
2. _ I _ C E

We need a valid 5-letter word matching either pattern, using only letters not yet excluded: {B, D, G, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus vowels {U, O, E, I} (E and I are already placed).

Possible candidates:

Pattern C I _ _ E:
- C I D G E – cidg-e? Not a word.
- C I P P E – cippe? Not a word.
- C I T T E – citte? Not a word.
- C I K E ? – need 5 letters. CIKEE? No.

Pattern _ I _ C E:
- B I T C E – bitce? Not a word.
- D I V C E – divce? Not a word.
- G I V C E – givce? Not a word.
- L I C C E – licce? Not a word.

Wait, let me think of real words.

Real 5-letter words ending in E, with I in position 2 and C somewhere:

Pattern _ I _ C E:
- V I C E ? – vic-e is 4 letters.
- P I C E ? – pice is 4 letters.
- L I C E ? – lice is 4 letters.

Hmm, maybe _ I C _ E but C not in position 3 – but earlier we saw FICHE had C in 3 and feedback was C(-) (wrong position), so C is not in 3.

Wait, let's re-express:

From FICHE feedback:
- C is NOT in position 3 (C(-) means wrong position)
- So C must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me list valid English 5-letter words fitting:
- C I _ _ E: CIDER (but has D and R; R is forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIGAR (A and R forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIVET (T allowed, V allowed, but CIVET has T in 4th, E in 5th)
- CIVET: C, I, V, E, T – check letters:
   - C (allowed), I (position 2 ✓), V (allowed), E (position 5 ✓), T (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters R, A, S, M, N, F, H
   - C is in position 1, which is allowed (since C just can't be in 3)

CIVET seems valid.

Alternative _ I _ C E:
- B I O C E – bioc-e? Not a word.
- P I C K E – picke? Not valid.
- T I C K E – ticke? Not valid.

CIVET appears to be the only valid option.

But let me check another: C I T E ? – citee? No.

CIVET is the clear choice.

From all four guesses we now know:

Current fixed facts

- I is in position 2
- C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 → must be in position 4 (only remaining spot)
- Forbidden letters: R, A, S, M, N, F, H, V, T

We need one consonant in position 1 that is still allowed and makes a valid 5-letter English word.

Allowed letters for position 1:  
{B, D, G, J, K, L, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z}

Look for real 5-letter words of form “? I C E”:

- B I C E – “bice” is 4 letters, need 5
- D I C E – 4 letters
- G I C E – 4 letters
- L I C E – 4 letters

But with an extra letter inserted at position 3:

- B I D C E – “bidce” invalid
- G I D C E – “gidce” invalid
- L I D C E – “lidce” invalid

Actually, the only valid English 5-letter word that ends “ICE” is “JUICE”, but we have J and U still allowed.

Check letters in JUICE:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good choices include words with vowels and common consonants like 'A', 'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', etc.

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E - covers common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E - similar reasoning)
- AROSE (A,R,O,S,E - good vowel coverage)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E - another strong choice)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) covering different positions
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give me good information about vowels and common consonants in the first try.

R(x) – no R anywhere
A(x) – no A anywhere
I(-) – I is in the word, wrong position
S(x) – no S anywhere
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- ends with E
- contains I somewhere not in the 3rd position
- does NOT contain R, A, or S

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, C, D, P, B, etc.
Good vowels: we already know E is fixed and I is present; O and U are still possible.

I want a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses I in a different position (1st, 2nd, or 4th)
3. Avoids R, A, S
4. Introduces new common consonants

Candidate guesses:
- T I M E D → ends with D, not E
- L I N E T → ends with T, not E
- N I T E ? – but we need 5 letters ending in E
- P I N E ? – 4 letters
- B I K E ? – 4 letters
Wait, need 5 letters that end in E. Let me think systematically:

T I M E  is 4 letters – need one more letter.  
How about “T I M E” with an extra consonant or vowel:  
M I T E R ends in R, not E.  
W I N T E – no.  
I need valid 5-letter words ending in E.

Words ending in E, with I somewhere else, exclude R/A/S:

- P I N E D – no, ends in D.  
- T I N E – 4 letters  
- M I N C E – ends E, has I, no R/A/S  
- L I C E – 4 letters  
- B I N G E – ends E, has I, no R/A/S  

Let me pick M I N C E: positions: 1=M, 2=I, 3=N, 4=C, 5=E.

Check:
- ends with E ✓
- contains I in position 2 (will test if it's correct)
- avoids R, A, S ✓
- introduces M, N, C as new consonants ✓

Another good candidate: B I N G E – same structure.

Between these, M I N C E is slightly more common.

Guess 3: FICHE → F(x) I(✓) C(-) H(x) E(✓)

- I is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 5.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- H and F are not in the word at all.

Forbidden letters so far: R, A, S, M, N, F, H

Current skeleton: _ I _ _ E, with C somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 3), so C must be in position 1 or 4.

So we have two patterns:
1. C I _ _ E
2. _ I _ C E

We need a valid 5-letter word matching either pattern, using only letters not yet excluded: {B, D, G, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus vowels {U, O, E, I} (E and I are already placed).

Possible candidates:

Pattern C I _ _ E:
- C I D G E – cidg-e? Not a word.
- C I P P E – cippe? Not a word.
- C I T T E – citte? Not a word.
- C I K E ? – need 5 letters. CIKEE? No.

Pattern _ I _ C E:
- B I T C E – bitce? Not a word.
- D I V C E – divce? Not a word.
- G I V C E – givce? Not a word.
- L I C C E – licce? Not a word.

Wait, let me think of real words.

Real 5-letter words ending in E, with I in position 2 and C somewhere:

Pattern _ I _ C E:
- V I C E ? – vic-e is 4 letters.
- P I C E ? – pice is 4 letters.
- L I C E ? – lice is 4 letters.

Hmm, maybe _ I C _ E but C not in position 3 – but earlier we saw FICHE had C in 3 and feedback was C(-) (wrong position), so C is not in 3.

Wait, let's re-express:

From FICHE feedback:
- C is NOT in position 3 (C(-) means wrong position)
- So C must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me list valid English 5-letter words fitting:
- C I _ _ E: CIDER (but has D and R; R is forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIGAR (A and R forbidden)
- C I _ _ E: CIVET (T allowed, V allowed, but CIVET has T in 4th, E in 5th)
- CIVET: C, I, V, E, T – check letters:
   - C (allowed), I (position 2 ✓), V (allowed), E (position 5 ✓), T (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters R, A, S, M, N, F, H
   - C is in position 1, which is allowed (since C just can't be in 3)

CIVET seems valid.

Alternative _ I _ C E:
- B I O C E – bioc-e? Not a word.
- P I C K E – picke? Not valid.
- T I C K E – ticke? Not valid.

CIVET appears to be the only valid option.

But let me check another: C I T E ? – citee? No.

CIVET is the clear choice.

Current fixed facts
- Word ends with E (position 5 = E)
- I is in position 2
- C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 → must be in position 4 (only remaining spot)
- Forbidden letters: R, A, S, M, N, F, H, V, T

So the skeleton is:
_  I  _  C  E

We need one consonant in position 1 that is still allowed and makes a valid 5-letter English word.

Allowed letters for position 1:  
{B, D, G, J, K, L, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z}

Look for real 5-letter words of form “? I C E”:

- B I C E – “bice” is 4 letters, need 5
- D I C E – 4 letters
- G I C E – 4 letters
- L I C E – 4 letters
- P I C E – 4 letters
- W I C E – 4 letters

But with an extra letter inserted at position 3:

- B I D C E – “bidce” invalid
- G I D C E – “gidce” invalid
- L I D C E – “lidce” invalid

Actually, the only valid English 5-letter word that ends “ICE” is “JUICE”, but we have J and U still allowed.

Check letters in JUICE:
J, U, I, C, E
- J – allowed
- U – allowed
- I – position 2 ✓
- C – position 4 ✓
- E – position 5 ✓
- No forbidden letters

Hence JUICE fits every rule.
