For my first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I need a word that uses as many of these as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique, common letters. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S and T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know:
- R and E are in the secret word.
- S, T, A are NOT in the secret word.

Remaining common letters to test: I, O, N, L, C, U, M, D, P, etc.

Since R and E are in the word but not in the right positions (R is 4th in STARE, E is 5th), I need to try them in new positions.

A good follow-up guess would be a word that:
1. Keeps R and E (but moves them).
2. Adds new, common letters we haven't tested yet.
3. Avoids S, T, A.

Possible candidates: ""CRONE"" (but has E in 5th position again), ""PRONE"" (E in 5th), ""ROBIN"" (R is 1st), ""NERDY"" (E is 2nd), ""URBEN"" (E is 4th).

Let’s summarize what we know so far:

1. Letters **NOT** in the word at all: S, T, A, N, D, Y.
2. Letters that **are** in the word but are in the **wrong positions** in both guesses:
   - R — appeared in position 4 (STARE) and position 3 (NERDY) but is not in either of those spots.
   - E — appeared in position 5 (STARE) and position 2 (NERDY) but is not in either of those spots.

So the secret word:
- Contains **R** (but not in pos 4 or 3).
- Contains **E** (but not in pos 5 or 2).
- Does **not** contain S, T, A, N, D, Y.

We still need to test other common letters like I, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc. I should pick a word that:
- Includes R and E in new positions.
- Uses three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoids the six eliminated letters.

Candidate positions for R and E:
- R: possible in 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- E: possible in 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out).

A good candidate is **CRUEL**:
- C, U, L are new letters.
- E in 4th (allowed).
- R in 3rd — wait, 3rd was ruled out! So no.

Try **PERIL**:
- P, I, L new; E in 3rd (allowed), R in 2nd (allowed).
- Checks all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I need a word that uses as many of these as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique, common letters. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S and T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know:
- R and E are in the secret word.
- S, T, A are NOT in the secret word.

Remaining common letters to test: I, O, N, L, C, U, M, D, P, etc.

Since R and E are in the word but not in the right positions (R is 4th in STARE, E is 5th), I need to try them in new positions.

A good follow-up guess would be a word that:
1. Keeps R and E (but moves them).
2. Adds new, common letters we haven't tested yet.
3. Avoids S, T, A.

Possible candidates: ""CRONE"" (but has E in 5th position again), ""PRONE"" (E in 5th), ""ROBIN"" (R is 1st), ""NERDY"" (E is 2nd), ""URBEN"" (E is 4th).

I like ""NERDY"" because:
- N, D, Y are new letters to test.
- R moves from 4th to 3rd position.
- E moves from 5th to 2nd position.

Confirmed letters in the word: R, E

- R ≠ 2, 4

Therefore:
- R must be in position 1, 3, or 5  
- E must be in position 1 or 4

Common letters still available: I, L, C, U, M, B, F, H, P, K, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R and E  
- places R not in 2 or 4  
- places E not in 2, 3, or 5  
- uses only letters not already ruled out

Let’s try “CREPE” – but it repeats P and only adds one new letter.  
Let’s use “PERCH” – but H is a bit rare.

A safer, high-information word that meets all constraints is “RELIC”:
- R at 1 (allowed)  
- E at 2 – wait, 2 is forbidden for E.

“CRUEL”:
- C, U, L are new letters  
- R in 3, E in 4 – both positions are allowed  
- No forbidden letters

Checks:
- Letters used: C, R, U, E, L – all allowed  
- R positioned at 3 (allowed)

A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique, common letters. Some good options are:\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""STARE"" as it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words.

From the five pieces of feedback we now know:

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(-)  
   – S,T,A out.  
   – R and E are in the word, but not in positions 4 and 5.

2. NERDY → N(x) E(-) R(-) D(x) Y(x)  
   – N,D,Y out.  
   – E not in 2, R not in 3.

3. GROVE → G(x) R(-) O(x) V(x) E(-)  
   – G,O,V out.  
   – E not in 5, R not in 2.

4. CRUEL → C(x) R(-) U(x) E(✓) L(x)  
   – C,U,L out.  
   – E is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.

Allowed positions so far:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- R must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2,3,4).

Letters still allowed: any not yet ruled out (B,F,H,I,K,M,P,W,Z etc.)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 4.  
- R in position 1 or 5.  
- No banned letters.

Simplest: put R at 1 and fill the rest with new common letters.

Candidate: R I F _ E  
Gap 3: any allowed letter. Let’s try M.

Word: “RIFME” → but not a recognized word.  
Better: “PRIME” – but P not banned, fits.

Check: P,R,I,M,E  
- E at 4 ✓  
- R at 2 – but 2 is forbidden (from GROVE).  

Next: “B R I E F”  
- E at 4 ✓  
- R at 2 – forbidden.

Next: “F R I E Z” – not a word.

How about “FRIER”?  
- E at 4 ✓  
- R at 5 ✓  
Letters used: F,R,I,E,R – all allowed.

Dictionary check: FRIER is valid (variant of “fryer”).

Looks good.
