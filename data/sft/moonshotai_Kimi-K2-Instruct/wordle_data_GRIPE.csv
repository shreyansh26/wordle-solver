For the first guess, we want to pick a word that uses common letters and gives us a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and follows a common 5-letter pattern. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Current confirmed information:

- Pattern: _ R I _ _  
  (R is fixed in position 2, I is fixed in position 3)

- Position 5 (last letter):  
  – E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (from CRIED feedback: E(-) means E appears, but not in 5th place).

Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, T, B, C, D

Available high-frequency letters: F, G, H, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y plus E (which must be placed somewhere before the final position).

Possible word patterns:  
_ R I _ E is impossible (E can’t be 5th), so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s pick a word that keeps R I in place, places E in position 1 (front-loading E is unusual, so position 4 is more common), and uses remaining common letters.

Candidate: FRIZE (but Z is rarer, and we prefer common letters).  
Another candidate: GRIPE – G, P are common.  
Another: PRIVE – P, V are common.  
Another: PRIZE – Z is rare.  
Yet another: URIEL – U is common, but it’s a name.

Let’s choose GRIME:
- G unused, common
- R, I confirmed in place
- M unused, common
- E placed in position 4 (allowed, since E can’t be 5th)

GRIME fits the pattern _ R I _ E with E in 4th, and all letters are allowed.

Therefore, GRIME is a strong next guess.

<guess>GRIME</guess>",GRIME,"Current confirmed information:

- Pattern: _ R I _ _  
  (R is fixed in position 2, I is fixed in position 3)

- Position 5 (last letter):  
  – E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (from CRIED feedback: E(-) means E appears, but not in 5th place).

Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, T, B, C, D

Available high-frequency letters: F, G, H, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y plus E (which must be placed somewhere before the final position).

Possible word patterns:  
_ R I _ E is impossible (E can’t be 5th), so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s pick a word that keeps R I in place, places E in position 1 (front-loading E is unusual, so position 4 is more common), and uses remaining common letters.

Candidate: FRIZE (but Z is rarer, and we prefer common letters).  
Another candidate: GRIPE – G, P are common.  
Another: PRIVE – P, V are common.  
Another: PRIZE – Z is rare.  
Yet another: URIEL – U is common, but it’s a name.

Let’s choose GRIME:
- G unused, common
- R, I confirmed in place
- M unused, common
- E placed in position 4 (allowed, since E can’t be 5th)

GRIME fits the pattern _ R I _ E with E in 4th, and all letters are allowed.

Therefore, GRIME is a strong next guess.",Guess 4: GRIME -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to pick a word that uses common letters and gives us a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use several of these.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and follows a common 5-letter pattern. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x)  – A is not in the word at all.  
R(✓) – R is in the word and in the 2nd position.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the word pattern is:  _ R _ _ E, with letters A, O, S excluded.

Letters still in the pool that commonly appear in English: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits R in position 2 and E in position 5 and uses other high-frequency letters not yet excluded.

A good candidate is “TRIBE”:
- T is common.
- R is confirmed in slot 2.
- I is common.
- B is common.
- E is confirmed in slot 5.

It also introduces four new letters (T, I, B) while keeping the two confirmed letters in place.

- Pattern: _ R I _ E   (R in 2nd, I in 3rd, E in 5th)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, T, B
- Still-available high-frequency letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ R I _ E, avoids the forbidden letters, and uses common remaining letters.

Good candidates:
- CRIED – C and D are both common and unused; D also works in position 4.
- PRIED – P is common; D again works.
- FRIED – F is common; D works.

Among these, CRIED gives us two new consonants (C and D) and is itself a common word.

Hence, CRIED is the best next guess.
