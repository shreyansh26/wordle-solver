For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us maximum information about the letters that might be in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English. A popular choice among word game enthusiasts is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Summary of what we know:

1. Position 3 must actually be **O** (✓ from Guess 1), but Guess 2 shows an **O(-)**—this can only mean the **O is in the word but NOT in position 3** despite the earlier “✓”.  
   The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbols were mis-interpreted; the proper interpretation is:

   AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  → O is in **position 3**.  
   DONUT → D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x) → O is in the word **but NOT in position 3**.

   These two statements are contradictory.  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 1 was intended to show **O(✓)** meaning “correct position” (position 3), but the feedback for Guess 2 shows **O(-)** meaning letter exists but wrong position (i.e., not in position 3).  This is impossible unless the feedback symbols were swapped.  Assuming the second feedback is correct, then O exists but is NOT in position 3, so we must disregard the first “✓”.

Hence the actionable facts are:
- A, R, S, E, D, U, T are **not** in the word.  
- O **is** in the word, **but not in position 3**.

Letters still available (common): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want a word that uses some fresh common letters and places O somewhere other than position 3.

A good candidate is **FOGHY**:
- Contains O in position 2 (satisfies “O exists, not position 3”).  
- Letters F, G, H, Y have not been tested yet.  
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

Let me re-express the feedback unambiguously.

- Guess 1: A R O S E  
  A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
  ⇒ O is **correct in position 3**.

- Guess 2: D O N U T  
  D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x)  
  ⇒ O is **present but not in position 3** (contradicts the first feedback).

- Guess 3: F O G H Y  
  F(x) O(-) G(x) H(x) Y(x)  
  ⇒ again O is present but **not in position 3**.

The only way these statements can all be true is if the feedback in Guess 1 was mis-recorded; the intended meaning must be that the symbol “✓” actually indicates “correct letter, wrong position” (like Wordle’s yellow square), not “correct position”.  That single reinterpretation makes everything consistent.

Re-interpreting with that convention:

- AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
  ⇒ O is in the word **but not in position 3**.
- DONUT → D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x)  
  ⇒ O is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- FOGHY → F(x) O(-) G(x) H(x) Y(x)  
  ⇒ O is in the word but **not in position 2**.

So we now know with certainty:

1. O is somewhere in the word.  
2. O is **not in positions 2 or 3**.  
3. Letters **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, D, U, T, F, G, H, Y.  
4. Remaining candidate letters: B, C, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Given that O must be in position 1, 4, or 5, let’s pick a word that places O in a new position and introduces several fresh common letters.  A good choice is “BLOCK”:

- O is in position 2 → but this conflicts with feedback above.  
- Instead try “COBIA” → contains forbidden A.  
- Try “COBIX” → contains forbidden X is rare and may not be valid.  
- Try “COBRA” → contains forbidden R and A.

Better to pick a word with O in position **4** and with common consonants we haven’t tested.  A valid word is “MOLIC” (but C is ok).  However, C is untested, M is untested, L is untested, I is untested, and O is known present.  “MOLIC” might be good.

But let’s select a word that definitely uses untested letters and places O in position **4**.

A valid word: **CONIC**.

Check:
- C, O, N, I, C → O in position 2 still not allowed.  
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.  Try **POLIO** → contains forbidden O.  
- Try **ZONIC** → contains forbidden N.  

Instead, try **BOCIS** → S forbidden.

Actually, N was only marked “(-)” in DONUT, which means N is in the word but not in position 3.  So **N is in the word somewhere**.

Re-express definitive facts:

- O is in the word.  
- N is in the word (from DONUT feedback: N(-)).  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, D, U, T, F, G, H, Y.  
- Allowed letters: B, C, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word containing both O and N, with O not in positions 2 or 3, and N not in position 4, and only using allowed letters.

Try “BISON” → S forbidden.  
Try “CINCO” → C allowed, I allowed, N allowed, O allowed, C allowed.  But O is in position 5.  Valid.

- Guess 2: D O N U T

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us maximum information about the letters that might be in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English. A popular choice among word game enthusiasts is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This will help us quickly identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)

This tells us:
1. The letter O is in the word and in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

Since we know nothing about the other letters, let's pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good choice is ""DONUT"":
- D, N, T are common consonants.
- U is another common vowel (and hasn't been tested yet).
- O is in the 3rd position (matches the feedback).

Check: DONUT does not contain A, R, S, E.

1. Position 3 must actually be **O** (✓ from Guess 1), but Guess 2 shows an **O(-)**—this can only mean the **O is in the word but NOT in position 3** despite the earlier “✓”.  
   The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbols were mis-interpreted; the proper interpretation is:

   AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  → O is in **position 3**.  
   DONUT → D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x) → O is in the word **but NOT in position 3**.

   These two statements are contradictory.  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 1 was intended to show **O(✓)** meaning “correct position” (position 3), but the feedback for Guess 2 shows **O(-)** meaning letter exists but wrong position (i.e., not in position 3).  This is impossible unless the feedback symbols were swapped.  Assuming the second feedback is correct, then O exists but is NOT in position 3, so we must disregard the first “✓”.

Hence the actionable facts are:
- A, R, S, E, D, U, T are **not** in the word.  
- O **is** in the word, **but not in position 3**.

Letters still available (common): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want a word that uses some fresh common letters and places O somewhere other than position 3.

A good candidate is **FOGHY**:
- Contains O in position 2 (satisfies “O exists, not position 3”).  
- Letters F, G, H, Y have not been tested yet.  
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

4. CINCO → C(–) I(x) N(–) C(✓) O(–)  
   • C is **in position 4** (✓).  
   • N exists but is **not in position 3** (it can’t be 4 either from step 2, so N must be in 1, 2, or 5).  
   • O exists but is **not in position 5** (already fixed at 3).  
   • I is **absent** (x).  

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, D, U, T, F, G, H, Y, I.

Fixed letters:
- Position 3: O  
- Position 4: C  

Remaining slots: 1, 2, 5.  
Guaranteed letters still to place: N (must go in 1, 2, or 5).

Allowed letters left: B, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need:
• 5-letter word  
• Pattern: ? ? O C ?  
• Must contain N somewhere (1, 2, or 5)  
• Only use allowed letters.

Simplest candidates:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
- Let’s try N in position 1: N _ O C _  
  Second and fifth letters must come from {B,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z}.  
  A common valid word: N B O C K → check dictionary: “NBOCK” is invalid.  
  Try N L O C K → “NLOCK” invalid.  
  Try N J O C K → invalid.  
  Try N P O C K → invalid.  

Next, N in position 2: _ N O C _  
First and fifth letters from allowed set.  
Try B N O C K – “BNOCK” invalid.  
Try M N O C K – invalid.

Next, N in position 5: _ _ O C N  
First and second letters allowed.  
Try B L O C N – valid? “BLOCN” invalid.  
Try P L O C N – invalid.  
Try J U? – U forbidden.  
Try V I? – I forbidden.  
Try M U? – U forbidden.  
Try B I? – I forbidden.

Wait: we overlooked the letter K.  Try K N O C K – “KNOCK” is a valid 5-letter English word.  
Check constraints:
- K (allowed), N (must be present), O (position 3), C (position 4), K (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  
- N is in position 2 (which is allowed).  

Perfect.
