For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first word should cover these without repeating letters to test as many letters as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but less consonant coverage)
- AUDIO (similar to ADIEU)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes 3 very common vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, T, L), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Feedback recap:  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
L(x) – L is not in the word.  
A(x) – A is not in the word.  
T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- The letters S, L, A are completely out.
- The word contains T and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with T and E in different spots than 4 and 5.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should use new consonants and a different vowel while placing T and E in new positions. Common consonants not yet used include R, N, C, H, M, P, etc. A good second guess that repositions T and E while introducing fresh letters is “TREND”:
- T moves from position 4 to 1.  
- E moves from position 5 to 3.  
- We test R, N, D as new letters.  
This gives us 5 fresh letters to evaluate with minimal overlap from the first guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses plus their feedback.

Known letters OUT: S, L, A, D  
Known letters IN (but unknown positions): T, E, R, N

(From Guess 1: T(-) and E(-) were marked present but wrong spots; from Guess 2: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(-) confirm all four letters are in the word, only their exact positions are still wrong.)

So every letter of the secret word is one of {T, E, R, N} plus one more letter (the fifth) we haven’t tested yet.  
Because the same four letters cannot repeat four times, each of T, E, R, N must appear exactly once, and the fifth letter must be something we haven’t tried so far.

Positions we can deduce quickly:
- T cannot be in spot 1 or 4 (from guesses 2 and 1 respectively).  
- E cannot be in spot 3 or 5 (from guesses 2 and 1 respectively).  
- R cannot be in spot 2.  
- N cannot be in spot 4.

We still need to test a new consonant to discover the fifth distinct letter. Common untested consonants include C, H, M, P, etc. Let’s pick C as a high-frequency letter that hasn’t appeared yet.

A word that rearranges T, E, R, N and adds C while respecting the positional restrictions is “CENTR”.  
- C is new.  
- E is in spot 2 – allowed.  
- N is in spot 3 – allowed.  
- T is in spot 4 – allowed (T was excluded only from 1 and 4, but 4 is now permitted because the earlier exclusion was only relative to its prior guess positions).  
Wait: actually T was in spot 1 in guess 2 (marked -) and spot 4 in guess 1 (marked -), so T cannot be 1 or 4. So spot 4 for T is disallowed.  
Let’s try “RECTN” – but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Valid word choice: “CRENT” – also invalid.  
Another rearrangement with C: “CRONE” – but O and E are both in it and O hasn’t been tested yet.  
Instead, “ENTRY” brings Y as new letter, but positions: E in 1 allowed, N in 2 allowed, T in 3 allowed, R in 4 allowed, Y in 5 new.  
But Y hasn’t been tested.  
But we want the simplest new consonant, so let’s use “NICER”:  
- N in 1 – allowed.  
- I new vowel.  
- C new consonant.  
- E in 4 – allowed (E can’t be 3 or 5, so 4 is fine).  
- R in 5 – allowed.  

This seems best: introduces C and I, repositions T to somewhere it hasn’t been (but… oops, T isn’t in NICER; I forgot T must be used).  
Let’s pick a valid English word that uses T, E, R, N plus C:  
“TENCH” – uses T, E, N, C, H. But H is new too. We can test both C and H.  
But we prefer minimal new letters.  
“CRONE” uses C, R, O, N, E – but O is new and T is missing.  
Wait: we must use T, E, R, N plus one new. So the fifth letter is one new and must be placed so the four known letters fit in their allowed positions.  

A valid word is “NICER” but again T is missing.  
Realization: we must include T, E, R, N exactly once each plus one new letter.  
So the letters are C, T, E, R, N. The only valid anagram is “TRENC” (invalid) or “CRETN” (invalid).  
Valid English word: “CRONE” doesn’t include T.  
Valid word: “CRANE” – but A is out.  
“CREPT” – P, T, E, C, R – includes T, E, R, C, P. Uses P instead of N. But we know N is in the word from feedback.  
Backtrack: the four confirmed letters are T, E, R, N. So the fifth must be a new letter X forming a valid 5-letter word with permutations of T, E, R, N, X.  
Good candidate: “TENOR” – uses T, E, N, O, R.  
- O is new.  
- T: position 1 is forbidden (from T in guess 2 spot 1). So TENOR has T in spot 1 – invalid.  
“TONER”: T in 1 invalid.  
“INTER” – I new, but we must have T.  
“RENT C” – no.  
Valid word with C: “CENT” + extra letter – invalid.  
“ENTRY” – E, N, T, R, Y.  
- E in 1 allowed (forbidden spots for E: 3,5).  
- N in 2 allowed.  
- T in 3 allowed (forbidden spots for T: 1,4).  
- R in 4 allowed.  
- Y new.  

This seems the best valid choice.

So next guess is “ENTRY”.
