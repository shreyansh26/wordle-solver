For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'S', etc. 

Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of identifying vowels and some consonants early on.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore the hidden word:
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, or E.  
- Must be made up only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next turn, I want a word that:
1. Uses none of the disallowed letters (A, R, O, S, E).  
2. Contains a fresh set of common consonants and at least one common vowel (I or U or Y or the remaining vowels).  

Good candidates that meet both criteria:  
- UNTIL → uses U, N, T, I, L (all allowed).  
- UNITY → uses U, N, I, T, Y.  
- LUNCH → uses L, U, N, C, H.  

Among these, “UNTIL” is very common, includes the frequently occurring consonants N, T, L and the vowels U, I. It gives broad coverage without re-using any of the eliminated letters.

Letters confirmed in the word: U (now in position 2) and I (position 4).  
Word pattern so far: _ U _ I _

Remaining letters that have not been ruled out:  
Vowels: Y  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus any others not yet used)

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Has U in position 2 and I in position 4.  
- Uses only still-allowed letters.  
- Tests new common letters to narrow down remaining possibilities quickly.

Considering the pattern _ U _ I _, possible remaining common English letters: B, C, G, K, P, V, Y.

One strong candidate is “CUPIY” but that’s not a valid English word.  
“BUDDY” – but D is eliminated.  
“PUPPY” – P and Y are allowed, but P is repeated.  
“GUMMY” – M is eliminated.  
“BUXIY” – X and Y are allowed, but not a valid word.  
“QUICK” – Q not tested yet, but Q is usually paired with U. However, U is already in position 2.  

Wait – QUICK has Q as first letter and U as second. That fits _U_I_ only if Q is allowed in first spot. “QUICK” is valid, hasn’t been ruled out yet, and tests new letters Q, C, K.

But let’s check:  
- Q: not yet tested – possible  
- U: already confirmed, and in position 2 ✔  
- I: already confirmed, in position 4 ✔  
- C and K: new letters to test

So “QUICK” fits the pattern _U_I_ and tests three new letters (Q, C, K) without using any eliminated letters.

Another valid option is “BUMPY” – but M is eliminated.  
“PUBIC” – C is allowed, but B, C are new. However the I is already in position 4, so “PUBIC” would be P U B I C – but the feedback for I is already ✓ in position 4, so this would place C in position 5 (fine). Let’s check if PUBIC is valid – yes.  

Between QUICK and PUBIC, QUICK tests Q, C, K while PUBIC tests P, B, C. QUICK seems slightly better as Q is highly informative.  

Therefore, I choose QUICK.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'S', etc. 

Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of identifying vowels and some consonants early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore the hidden word:
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, or E.  
- Must be made up only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next turn, I want a word that:
1. Uses none of the disallowed letters (A, R, O, S, E).  
2. Contains a fresh set of common consonants and at least one common vowel (I or U or Y or the remaining vowels).  

Good candidates that meet both criteria:  
- UNTIL → uses U, N, T, I, L (all allowed).  
- UNITY → uses U, N, I, T, Y.  
- LUNCH → uses L, U, N, C, H.  

Among these, “UNTIL” is very common, includes the frequently occurring consonants N, T, L and the vowels U, I. It gives broad coverage without re-using any of the eliminated letters.

Remaining frequent consonants: D, B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels (besides I already placed): U, Y (sometimes)

Because the 4th letter is fixed as I, the word looks like: _ _ _ I _

We need to use U somewhere other than position 1.

2. Uses other still-available frequent consonants
3. Keeps the fourth letter as I

From the four guesses we have:

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, H, M, D, Q, K

Known letters still in play:  
- U must be in position 2 (✓ in HUMID).  
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (it was ✓ in position 4 in HUMID, then moved to position 3 in QUICK and became “-”).  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from QUICK feedback “C(-)”).

So the pattern must be:  
_ U _ I _   (because I can’t be 3rd again and must still appear somewhere)

We need three still-allowed consonants for positions 1, 3, 5.  
Available consonants so far: B, F, G, P, V, W, Y, X, Z (plus any others not ruled out yet).

Let’s pick a word that fits _ U _ I _ and tests new, common letters.  
“BUGGY” – G is common, but G appears twice and Y is common.  
“PUPIL” – L is eliminated.  
“VIVID” – V is allowed but D is eliminated.  
“FUGGY” – F and G are both still allowed.  
“CUBIC” – C is allowed, but we already know C is in the word; we need to place it correctly.

Actually, we know C is in the word but not in position 4, so we can try placing C in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try a word that puts C in position 3:  
F U C I _ – we need a fifth letter.  
“FUCID” – D is eliminated.  
“FUCIN” – N is eliminated.  
“FUCIS” – S is eliminated.  
“FUCIB” – B is allowed.  
“FUCIB” isn’t a valid English word.

Alternative: place C in position 5.  
_ U _ I C  
Common English words: “BUSIC” – not valid.  
“CUSIC” – C is already in word; but again, not a valid word.  
“LUSIC” – L is eliminated.  

So let’s instead focus on common letters and try “FUNGI” – but G and I are okay, but “FUNGI” is 5 letters? F-U-N-G-I: 5 letters.  
Check:  
F (allowed), U (position 2), N (eliminated – x in UNTIL). So no.

How about “CUBIC”?  
C, U, B, I, C: five letters.  
C is allowed, U in position 2, I somewhere else.  
But in “CUBIC”, the pattern is C U B I C.  
- C in position 1 is new – allowed.  
- U in position 2 – required.  
- B is allowed.  
- I is in position 4 – allowed (no restriction yet on position 4).  
- C in position 5 – allowed (C is in word, and we don’t know where yet).

“CUBIC” is a valid English word. It tests C in two spots (helping to fix its position) and introduces B.

Alternatively, “VIGIL” – but L is eliminated.  
“PUDIO” – O eliminated.  
“GUPPY” – P is allowed, G is allowed, Y is allowed. Pattern: G U P P Y – but that doesn’t fit _U_I_. We need I in the word.

So the strongest candidate fitting _U_I_ with still-available letters is:

B U _ I _  

We need consonants for 3 and 5.  
“BUXIC” – not valid.  
“BUDIC” – D eliminated.  
“BUGID” – D eliminated.  
“BUNGI” – N is eliminated.  
“BUMPI” – M is eliminated.  
“BUPPI” – P is allowed. “BUPPI” is not a valid word.

Actually, let’s list valid English words that fit _U_I_ with allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _U_I_ and using only allowed letters:

- VIGIL – invalid (L eliminated)  
- BIKIN – N eliminated  
- CUPID – D eliminated

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'O', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'S', etc. 

Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of identifying vowels and some consonants early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore the hidden word:
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, or E.  
- Must be made up only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next turn, I want a word that:
1. Uses none of the disallowed letters (A, R, O, S, E).  
2. Contains a fresh set of common consonants and at least one common vowel (I or U or Y or the remaining vowels).  

Good candidates that meet both criteria:  
- UNTIL → uses U, N, T, I, L (all allowed).  
- UNITY → uses U, N, I, T, Y.  
- LUNCH → uses L, U, N, C, H.  

Among these, “UNTIL” is very common, includes the frequently occurring consonants N, T, L and the vowels U, I. It gives broad coverage without re-using any of the eliminated letters.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L (from both guesses)
- Letters confirmed: 
  – I is in the word and in the correct position (4th spot)
  – U is in the word but NOT in the 1st spot

Remaining frequent consonants: D, B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels (besides I already placed): U, Y (sometimes)

Because the 4th letter is fixed as I, the word looks like: _ _ _ I _

We need to use U somewhere other than position 1.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Places U in a new spot (not first)
2. Uses other still-available frequent consonants
3. Keeps the fourth letter as I

Candidate: “HUMID”  
– H, M, D have not been used yet  
– U is in position 2 (allowed)  
– I is in position 4 (matches feedback)  
– No disallowed letters appear

<guess>HUMID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: HUMID -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(x) I(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, H, M, D  
Letters confirmed in the word: U (now in position 2) and I (position 4).  
Word pattern so far: _ U _ I _

Remaining letters that have not been ruled out:  
Vowels: Y  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus any others not yet used)

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Has U in position 2 and I in position 4.  
- Uses only still-allowed letters.  
- Tests new common letters to narrow down remaining possibilities quickly.

Considering the pattern _ U _ I _, possible remaining common English letters: B, C, G, K, P, V, Y.

One strong candidate is “CUPIY” but that’s not a valid English word.  
“BUDDY” – but D is eliminated.  
“PUPPY” – P and Y are allowed, but P is repeated.  
“GUMMY” – M is eliminated.  
“BUXIY” – X and Y are allowed, but not a valid word.  
“QUICK” – Q not tested yet, but Q is usually paired with U. However, U is already in position 2.  

Wait – QUICK has Q as first letter and U as second. That fits _U_I_ only if Q is allowed in first spot. “QUICK” is valid, hasn’t been ruled out yet, and tests new letters Q, C, K.

But let’s check:  
- Q: not yet tested – possible  
- U: already confirmed, and in position 2 ✔  
- I: already confirmed, in position 4 ✔  
- C and K: new letters to test

So “QUICK” fits the pattern _U_I_ and tests three new letters (Q, C, K) without using any eliminated letters.

Another valid option is “BUMPY” – but M is eliminated.  
“PUBIC” – C is allowed, but B, C are new. However the I is already in position 4, so “PUBIC” would be P U B I C – but the feedback for I is already ✓ in position 4, so this would place C in position 5 (fine). Let’s check if PUBIC is valid – yes.  

Between QUICK and PUBIC, QUICK tests Q, C, K while PUBIC tests P, B, C. QUICK seems slightly better as Q is highly informative.  

Therefore, I choose QUICK.

<guess>QUICK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: HUMID -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) M(x) I(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: QUICK -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(✓) I(-) C(-) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the four guesses we have:

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, H, M, D, Q, K

Known letters still in play:  
- U must be in position 2 (✓ in HUMID).  
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (it was ✓ in position 4 in HUMID, then moved to position 3 in QUICK and became “-”).  
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from QUICK feedback “C(-)”).

So the pattern must be:  
_ U _ I _   (because I can’t be 3rd again and must still appear somewhere)

We need three still-allowed consonants for positions 1, 3, 5.  
Available consonants so far: B, F, G, P, V, W, Y, X, Z (plus any others not ruled out yet).

Let’s pick a word that fits _ U _ I _ and tests new, common letters.  
“BUGGY” – G is common, but G appears twice and Y is common.  
“PUPIL” – L is eliminated.  
“VIVID” – V is allowed but D is eliminated.  
“FUGGY” – F and G are both still allowed.  
“CUBIC” – C is allowed, but we already know C is in the word; we need to place it correctly.

Actually, we know C is in the word but not in position 4, so we can try placing C in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try a word that puts C in position 3:  
F U C I _ – we need a fifth letter.  
“FUCID” – D is eliminated.  
“FUCIN” – N is eliminated.  
“FUCIS” – S is eliminated.  
“FUCIB” – B is allowed.  
“FUCIB” isn’t a valid English word.

Alternative: place C in position 5.  
_ U _ I C  
Common English words: “BUSIC” – not valid.  
“CUSIC” – C is already in word; but again, not a valid word.  
“LUSIC” – L is eliminated.  

So let’s instead focus on common letters and try “FUNGI” – but G and I are okay, but “FUNGI” is 5 letters? F-U-N-G-I: 5 letters.  
Check:  
F (allowed), U (position 2), N (eliminated – x in UNTIL). So no.

How about “CUBIC”?  
C, U, B, I, C: five letters.  
C is allowed, U in position 2, I somewhere else.  
But in “CUBIC”, the pattern is C U B I C.  
- C in position 1 is new – allowed.  
- U in position 2 – required.  
- B is allowed.  
- I is in position 4 – allowed (no restriction yet on position 4).  
- C in position 5 – allowed (C is in word, and we don’t know where yet).

“CUBIC” is a valid English word. It tests C in two spots (helping to fix its position) and introduces B.

Alternatively, “VIGIL” – but L is eliminated.  
“PUDIO” – O eliminated.  
“GUPPY” – P is allowed, G is allowed, Y is allowed. Pattern: G U P P Y – but that doesn’t fit _U_I_. We need I in the word.

So the strongest candidate fitting _U_I_ with still-available letters is:

B U _ I _  

We need consonants for 3 and 5.  
“BUXIC” – not valid.  
“BUDIC” – D eliminated.  
“BUGID” – D eliminated.  
“BUNGI” – N is eliminated.  
“BUMPI” – M is eliminated.  
“BUPPI” – P is allowed. “BUPPI” is not a valid word.

Actually, let’s list valid English words that fit _U_I_ with allowed letters.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _U_I_ and using only allowed letters:  
- CUBIC  
- VIGIL – invalid (L eliminated)  
- BIKIN – N eliminated  
- CUPID – D eliminated  
- PUPID – D eliminated  
- CUBBY – B is allowed, Y is allowed.  

“CUBIC” seems the best fit.
