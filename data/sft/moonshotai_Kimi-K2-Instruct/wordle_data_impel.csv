Since this is the first guess with no prior information, we need a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language while avoiding rare letters. 

Common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally contain many of these.

Looking at these letters, some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses five very common letters
2. The letters R, A, I, S, E appear in many English words
3. It has a good mix of consonants and vowels

Therefore, I'll choose RAISE as my first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, S are NOT in the word (x)
- I and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So our hidden word:
- Contains I and E (but not in positions 3 or 5)
- Does NOT contain R, A, or S
- Is 5 letters long

With I and E present, and their positions unknown, we can try to place them in new spots and introduce other common letters (T, N, L, C, O, D, etc.) to get more information.

A good next step is to use a word that:
- Has I and E in different positions
- Uses fresh common consonants
- Avoids R, A, S entirely

Good candidates:
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – but I is still in position 4
- UNTIE (U, N, T, I, E) – places E at 5 and I at 4
- ELITE (E, L, I, T, E) – repeats E
- INLET (I, N, L, E, T) – places I at 1, E at 4

""INLET"" is attractive because:
- It moves I to position 1 and E to position 4 (both new spots)
- Uses fresh common letters N, L, T
- Avoids disallowed letters R, A, S
- Is still a common word and valid 5-letter word

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters ruled out: R, A, S
   - Letters known to be present: I, E (but not in original positions 3 and 5)

2. INLET → I(✓) N(x) L(-) E(✓) T(x)
   - Additional info:
     – I is now locked in position 1
     – E is now locked in position 4
     – N and T are not in the word (x)
     – L is somewhere in the word but not in position 3 (-)

So the pattern we have is:
I _ _ E _  (positions 1 and 4 fixed)
Letters definitely out: R, A, S, N, T
Letters definitely in: I, E, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with I
- Has E in position 4
- Contains L but not in position 3
- Contains no R, A, S, N, T

Possible placements for L:
- Position 2 (I L _ E _)
- Position 5 (I _ _ E L)

Let’s consider both cases.

Case 1: L in position 2 → I L _ E _
We need a letter for position 3 that is common and hasn’t been ruled out yet. Possible consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: O, U.

Try combining with common consonants or vowels:
- I L C E _ — no 5-letter word like “ILCE_”
- I L D E _ — “ILDED” not valid
- I L G E _ — “ILGE_” not valid
- I L O E _ — “ILOES” not valid
- I L U E _ — “ILUE_” not valid

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Case 2: L in position 5 → I _ _ E L
Now we need letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding R, A, S, N, T.

Possible combinations for positions 2-3:
- C O → I C O E L (“ICOEL” not a word)
- C H → I C H E L (“ICHEL” not a word)
- D I → I D I E L (“IDIEL” not a word)
- D O → I D O E L (“IDOEL” not a word)

- H I → I H I E L (“IHIEL” not a word)
- M I → I M I E L (“IMIEL” not a word)
- P I → I P I E L (“IPIEL” not a word)
- V I → I V I E L (“IVIEL” not a word)
- W I → I W I E L (“IWIEL” not a word)
- Y I → I Y I E L (“IYIEL” not a word)
- C E → I C E E L (“ICEEL” not a word)
- L I → I L I E L (“ILIEL” not a word) — but L is supposed to be in position 5 here
- O D → I O D E L (“IODEL” not a word)
- O G → I O G E L (“IOGEL” not a word)
- O M → I O M E L (“IOMEL” not a word)
- O P → I O P E L (“IOPEL” not a word)
- U M → I U M E L (“IUMEL” not a word)
- U P → I U P E L (“IUPEL” not a word)

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to yield valid words. Maybe we’re missing something. Let’s think of actual existing words that start with I and end with EL or have E in position 4.

Real words that fit:
- I D E A L — but L is in position 5, and A is ruled out.
- I V I E D — but T is ruled out, and we already have E in position 4.
- I M I D E — not a word.
- I M P E L — this is a valid word! It starts with I, has P in position 2, M in position 3, E in position 4, and L in position 5. None of the letters are ruled out except N, T, R, A, S which are not present here.

“IMPEL” fits all constraints:
- I is in position 1 (✓ from INLET)
- E is in position 4 (✓ from INLET)
- L is in position 5 (was previously in position 3, now correctly placed)
- No R, A, S, N, T
- All letters are valid and common

Let’s verify:
- I (1) ✓
- M (2) — new letter
- P (3) — new letter

This seems perfect.
