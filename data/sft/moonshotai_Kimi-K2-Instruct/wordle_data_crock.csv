This is my first guess, and I have no prior information about the secret word. To maximize the information gained from this initial guess, I should choose a word that contains common English letters, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to use a word that covers as many unique letters as possible from the most common ones.

Common English letters in 5-letter words often include: A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L, C, D, H, etc. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

This gives me coverage of 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in English words, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback to narrow down future guesses.

All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with an “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in today’s secret word.  
Therefore, every remaining candidate word must:

- Exclude S, L, A, T, E completely.  
- Still be a valid 5-letter English word.

To extract the most information on my second guess, I want a brand-new set of letters that are still common and cover both vowels and consonants.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters (that were not in SLATE), a good set is: R, O, U, N, D.

The word “ROUND” uses all of those letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback so far:

1. SLATE → all letters x: S, L, A, T, E are out.
2. ROUND → R(-), O(-), U(x), N(x), D(x)

Therefore:
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D
- Known in-word letters (but wrong position): R, O
- Still-allowed letters (common ones): I, C, M, P, Y, H, G, B, K, F, V, W, etc.

I want a new word that:
- Contains both R and O (to test their correct positions)
- Uses only letters NOT eliminated
- Explores fresh consonants and vowels

A good choice is “CRIMP”:
- Includes R and O? No, let me rethink.

I need O and R present, so how about “GRIOT”?  
G, R, I, O, T – but T is already eliminated.

Next candidate that keeps both R and O and has fresh letters: “PRIMO”  
P, R, I, M, O – all letters are allowed (none in the eliminated list).

Positions:
- R is known to be in word but not in position 2; here it appears in position 2 again, which is fine because we’re testing if it belongs elsewhere (or confirming position 2 is wrong).
- O is known to be in word but not in position 2; here it is in position 5, which is a new spot.

Other consonants P, I, M are all fresh and high-frequency.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

To maximize the information gained from this initial guess, I should choose a word that contains common English letters, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to use a word that covers as many unique letters as possible from the most common ones.

Common English letters in 5-letter words often include: A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L, C, D, H, etc. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

This gives me coverage of 5 distinct letters that appear frequently in English words, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback to narrow down future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with an “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in today’s secret word.  
Therefore, every remaining candidate word must:

- Exclude S, L, A, T, E completely.  
- Still be a valid 5-letter English word.

To extract the most information on my second guess, I want a brand-new set of letters that are still common and cover both vowels and consonants.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters (that were not in SLATE), a good set is: R, O, U, N, D.

The word “ROUND” uses all of those letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:

1. SLATE → all letters x: S, L, A, T, E are out.
2. ROUND → R(-), O(-), U(x), N(x), D(x)

Therefore:
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D
- Known in-word letters (but wrong position): R, O
- Still-allowed letters (common ones): I, C, M, P, Y, H, G, B, K, F, V, W, etc.

I want a new word that:
- Contains both R and O (to test their correct positions)
- Uses only letters NOT eliminated
- Explores fresh consonants and vowels

A good choice is “CRIMP”:
- Includes R and O? No, let me rethink.

I need O and R present, so how about “GRIOT”?  
G, R, I, O, T – but T is already eliminated.

Next candidate that keeps both R and O and has fresh letters: “PRIMO”  
P, R, I, M, O – all letters are allowed (none in the eliminated list).

Positions:
- R is known to be in word but not in position 2; here it appears in position 2 again, which is fine because we’re testing if it belongs elsewhere (or confirming position 2 is wrong).
- O is known to be in word but not in position 2; here it is in position 5, which is a new spot.

Other consonants P, I, M are all fresh and high-frequency.

So “PRIMO” is a solid next guess.

The last guess’s feedback tells us we have the entire correct word except for the first letter:

- Position 1: F is NOT in the word (marked x).

So the target word looks like: _ R O C K.

We have already eliminated these letters: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, P, I, M, F.

Looking at the remaining unused consonants, and remembering this must be a valid English word, the only single-letter prefix that forms a common 5-letter word is “B” (BROCK is not standard), “C” already in the word, “G” gives GROCK (rare), “H” gives HROCK (not a word), “W” gives WROCK (not a word), “J” gives JROCK (not a word), etc.

But “BROCK” is listed in some dictionaries as a regional word for a badger or a color, yet it is rather uncommon. The far more common everyday word fitting _ R O C K is “BROCK”.

Hence the only reasonable remaining choice is BROCK.

We have already eliminated these letters: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, P, I, M, F.

Looking at the remaining unused consonants, and remembering this must be a valid English word, the only single-letter prefix that forms a common 5-letter word is “B” (BROCK is not standard), “C” already in the word, “G” gives GROCK (rare), “H” gives HROCK (not a word), “W” gives WROCK (not a word), “J” gives JROCK (not a word), etc.

But “BROCK” is listed in some dictionaries as a regional word for a badger or a color, yet it is rather uncommon. The far more common everyday word fitting _ R O C K is “BROCK”.

Hence the only reasonable remaining choice is BROCK.

So far we know the word has the structure _ R O C K and the letters already eliminated are:

S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, P, I, M, F, B

That leaves these remaining first-letter candidates (still unused consonants):
C, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Out of these, we need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these and is spelled _ R O C K.

- CROCK – invalid because C is already in position 3; would repeat letter C in word.
- GROCK – uncommon but acceptable in some dictionaries.
- HROCK – not a word.
- JROCK – not a word.
- VROCK – not a word.
- WROCK – not a word.
- The rest (QROCK, XROCK, YROCK, ZROCK) are definitely non-words.

Therefore the only remaining plausible word is GROCK.
