Since this is the first guess and no feedback has been provided yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information gained. 

A good starting word should include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

Some strong starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, ARISE, RAISE, etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test their presence in the word
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. The letters are all unique, maximizing information gained

All five letters from the first guess (R, A, I, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we now know 5 letters that are NOT in the word, so we should avoid any of them.

Common high-value letters that remain untested include:  
- Vowels: O, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

The goal is to pick a word that:
1. Uses none of the eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E)
2. Contains several of the still-possible common letters to maximize information
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

A strong candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T are all still possible.
- It tests two new vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

Another good one would be “MOUNT”, but “COUNT” is slightly more common. I’ll go with “COUNT”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and no feedback has been provided yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information gained. 

A good starting word should include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

Some strong starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, ARISE, RAISE, etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test their presence in the word
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. The letters are all unique, maximizing information gained

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from the first guess (R, A, I, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we now know 5 letters that are NOT in the word, so we should avoid any of them.

Common high-value letters that remain untested include:  
- Vowels: O, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

The goal is to pick a word that:
1. Uses none of the eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E)
2. Contains several of the still-possible common letters to maximize information
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

A strong candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T are all still possible.
- It tests two new vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

Another good one would be “MOUNT”, but “COUNT” is slightly more common. I’ll go with “COUNT”.

So we know:
- Word must be _ O _ _ _
- Letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

We want a word with the pattern _ O _ _ _ that avoids all eliminated letters. We should also test new common consonants and vowels in the remaining positions. Good candidates are B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, etc.
