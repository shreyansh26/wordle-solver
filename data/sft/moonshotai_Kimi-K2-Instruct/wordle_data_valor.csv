Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This generally means selecting a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices. 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common and cover vowels and common consonants. This seems like a strong first guess to gather maximum information.

The first guess AROSE produced:

A(-) – the letter A is in the word, but not in the first position.  
R(-) – the letter R is in the word, but not in the second position.  
O(-) – the letter O is in the word, but not in the third position.  
S(x) – the letter S is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – the letter E is not in the word at all.  

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

We now need a word that:
- includes A, R, O  
- does not use S or E  
- avoids putting A in position 1, R in position 2, O in position 3  
- preferably introduces a couple of new common consonants to maximize information gain.

Common remaining consonants we haven’t tried include L, N, T, C, D, etc. A good candidate is RATIO: it keeps A, R, O and adds T and I, while moving A, R, O to new positions (A is now 3, R is 1, O is 5). This should give useful feedback.

Checking positions:
- R in 1st: allowed (original feedback said R is not in 2nd)  
- A in 3rd: allowed (original feedback said A is not in 1st)  
- T is new.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(-), O(-), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - S and E are not in the word

2. RATIO → R(-), A(✓), T(x), I(x), O(-)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the correct position (position 2)
   - O is in the word but not in position 5
   - T and I are not in the word

So now we know:
- A is fixed in position 2
- R is somewhere, not positions 1 or 2
- O is somewhere, not positions 3 or 5
- The remaining letters are from the English alphabet excluding: S, E, T, I

Thus possible positions for letters:
- Position 1: cannot be R, S, E, T, I
- Position 2: must be A
- Position 3: cannot be O, S, E, T, I
- Position 4: no restrictions yet except excluding S, E, T, I
- Position 5: cannot be O, S, E, T, I

Let's pick a word that:
- has A in position 2
- uses R and O in valid positions
- introduces new common letters (like L, N, D, C, etc.)

Considering the constraints:
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O must be in positions 1, 2 (but 2 is A), or 4
   - So O must be in position 1 or 4

Let's try a word where:
- O is in position 1
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3 (since it can't be 1 or 2)
- Then we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5 from remaining common consonants

Possible candidates: ORAL? ORAL has A, R, O but we've already confirmed A is in position 2, not 4. ORAL would place A in 4 which conflicts.

Let's try:
- O in position 4
- Then position 1 must be a consonant not R (since R can't be 1), not S, E, T, I
- Common consonants left: D, L, N, C, etc.

A good word would be:
B R A N D? But B hasn't been tested and we need to place R somewhere.
Wait, A is fixed in position 2.

Let's try:
C R A N O? No, O is supposed to be in position 4 or 1, and A is fixed in 2.

Let me systematically construct:
Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
R must be in 3,4,5
O must be in 1 or 4

Option 1: O in position 1
O A _ _ _
Then R must be in 3,4,5
And we need two more consonants for remaining positions (not S,E,T,I)

Let's try:
O A R _ _
O A R C L? But we need 5 letter word, OARCL isn't a word.

O A R _ _ better to pick common endings:
O A R C H - but H is less common
O A R L Y - OARLY? Not a word.

Option 2: O in position 4
_ A _ O _
Then R must be in 3 or 5 (can't be 1,2, and 4 is O)
Let's try:
B A R O N - this has:
- B (new letter)
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)

S(x) – the letter S is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – the letter E is not in the word at all.  

So the secret word contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively, and it definitely lacks S and E.

We now need a word that:
- includes A, R, O  
- does not use S or E  
- avoids putting A in position 1, R in position 2, O in position 3  
- preferably introduces a couple of new common consonants to maximize information gain.

Common remaining consonants we haven’t tried include L, N, T, C, D, etc. A good candidate is RATIO: it keeps A, R, O and adds T and I, while moving A, R, O to new positions (A is now 3, R is 1, O is 5). This should give useful feedback.

Checking positions:
- R in 1st: allowed (original feedback said R is not in 2nd)  
- A in 3rd: allowed (original feedback said A is not in 1st)  
- T is new.  
- I is new.  
- O in 5th: allowed (original feedback said O is not in 3rd)

   - O is in the word but not in position 3

2. RATIO → R(-), A(✓), T(x), I(x), O(-)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the correct position (position 2)
   - O is in the word but not in position 5

So now we know:
- A is fixed in position 2
- R is somewhere, not positions 1 or 2
- O is somewhere, not positions 3 or 5
- The remaining letters are from the English alphabet excluding: S, E, T, I

Thus possible positions for letters:

- Position 2: must be A
- Position 3: cannot be O, S, E, T, I
- Position 4: no restrictions yet except excluding S, E, T, I

- L A C O R – not a word  
- P A D O R – not a word  
- G A D O R – not a word  
- V A D O R – not a word

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ A _ O _  
- Must contain R (not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4) → R must be in position 5  
- So far we have: _ A _ O R  

Letters already ruled out: S, E, T, I, B, N  
Remaining common consonants to fill position 1 and 3: C, D, G, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s choose a word that fits _ A _ O R and uses valid letters.  
Example valid words matching this pattern:  
- C A D O R (CADOR) – but CADOR isn’t a recognized English word  
- C A M O R – not a word  
- C A V O R – not a word  
- C A R O R – not a word  
- F A D O R – not a word  
- M A D O R – not a word  
- M A C O R – not a word  
- M A L O R – MALOR isn’t common, but MAJOR is a word but uses J  
- L A D O R – not a word  
- L A C O R – not a word  
- P A D O R – not a word  
- G A D O R – not a word  
- V A D O R – not a word  

Looking again, let’s check for valid 5-letter words ending in A _ O R:  
- FAVOR – F (new), A (pos 2), V (new), O (pos 4), R (pos 5) → fits all constraints  
- LABOR – L (new), A (pos 2), B (already ruled out) → invalid  
- MAJOR – M (new), A (pos 2), J (new), O (pos 4), R (pos 5) → fits, but J is less common  
- RADAR – R can’t be pos 1, and D is okay, but A in pos 3 conflicts (A must be pos 2)  
- TAVOR – T is ruled out  

The best valid word fitting the pattern _ A _ O R with remaining letters is FAVOR.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

Letters in the word, with their correct positions:
- A: position 2 ✓
- O: position 4 ✓
- R: position 5 ✓

Letters in the word but not yet locked to positions:
- V is in the word but not in position 3 (since FAVOR showed V(-)).

Letters ruled out entirely so far:
S, E, T, I, B, N, F

So the word has the form:
_  A  _  O  R

The missing letter is at position 1.  
We also know V is somewhere inside, and the only open slot left is position 3, but feedback said V is in the word but NOT in position 3. Therefore V must actually be in position 1, but that contradicts FAVOR's V at position 3 and the (-) feedback.

Wait, reread: FAVOR feedback:
F(x)  A(✓)  V(-)  O(✓)  R(✓)

That means:
- V is in the word but not in position 3.
- So V must be either position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.
  - Position 2 is A ✓
  - Position 4 is O ✓
  - Position 5 is R ✓
Therefore the only remaining place for V is position 1.

So the word must be V A V O R? No, letters can't repeat unless already shown. So far no repeats have been indicated.

Wait, let's list what we have:
Known pattern: ? A ? O R
And V must appear somewhere, but positions 2,4,5 are fixed, and position 3 cannot have V (V(-)), so V must be in position 1.

Thus the word is V A _ O R and the only letter left is that middle (position 3) consonant.

Letters not yet used and not ruled out: C, D, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
Valid 5-letter English words fitting V A _ O R:
- VADOR – not standard
- VAGOR – not standard
- VALOR – this is a recognized word
- VAPOR – recognized word
- VIGOR – but I is ruled out
Between VALOR and VAPOR, let's check letters:
VALOR uses L (new), V (position 1), etc. VAPOR uses P (new). Both plausible.

But we have no information yet distinguishing L vs P. Since we only have one guess left to guarantee finding the word, and both VALOR and VAPOR are the only common candidates, we must choose one. 

Let's choose VALOR.
