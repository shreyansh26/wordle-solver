Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can provide maximum information. I'll select a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess as it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good feedback to work with for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in the 1st position.

- O(x) : O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-) : S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓) : E is in the word AND in the 5th position (last letter).

2. Contains A but A is NOT the first letter.
3. Contains S but S is NOT the 4th letter.
4. Does NOT contain R or O.

Good candidates must use letters we haven't ruled out. Common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we know S is in the word but not at position 4, and A is in the word but not position 1, let’s try a word like ""STAGE"":
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains A but not in position 1 (A is in position 2 here, which is allowed)
- Contains S but not in position 4 (S is in position 1 here, which is allowed)
- No R or O.

But let me double-check: ""STAGE"" uses S, T, A, G, E - none of the forbidden letters. Seems good.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We are down to the pattern: S _ A _ E  
and have eliminated the letters R, O, T, G, H, D, P, C.

So positions 2 and 4 must be filled only with letters not yet ruled out.  
Letters still allowed (among common ones):
- Position 2: L, N, M, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
- Position 4: any of the same set, but different from position 2.

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit S _ A _ E and avoid every banned letter, the only remaining frequent candidates are:
- SLAVE → L (OK), V (OK)
- SNAKE → N (OK), K (OK)
- SMALE → M (OK), L (OK) (but “smale” is archaic)
- SWAGE → W (OK), G (already banned)
- STAVE → T (banned)

Among these, “SLAVE” and “SNAKE” are the strongest.  
Between them, “SLAVE” is slightly more common and uses L and V, neither of which have been tried or banned.

Current known facts after five guesses:

1. Pattern: S _ A _ E   (positions 1, 3, 5 locked)
2. Letters already ruled out for the remaining blanks (positions 2 & 4):
   R, O, T, G, H, D, P, C, L
3. Letters still allowed, common and unused:
   N, M, B, F, K, W, Y, V (but V was just shown in position 4, so for the 2nd position we can try remaining ones)

The V in the 4th position is now ✓, so the word is S _ A V E.

Only the second letter is unknown. Letters not yet eliminated for position 2:
N, M, B, F, K, W, Y (all others are ruled out).

Scanning common English words of the form S _ A V E, the only standard one is:

- S N A V E  (but “snave” isn’t a word)
- S M A V E  (non-word)
- S B A V E  → “BRAVE” but R is banned
- S F A V E  (non-word)
- S K A V E  (non-word)
- S W A V E  (non-word)
- S Y A V E  (non-word)

Wait, the feedback shows V(✓) in position 4, so the word is S _ A V E.  
The only common 5-letter word in English fitting S _ A V E is “STAVE”, but T is banned.  
Next candidate: “SHAVE” but H is banned.  
“SLAVE” we already tried and L is banned.  
“SPAVE”, “SCAVE” – P and C banned.  
“SWAVE” – not a word.  
“SKAVE” – not a word.  
“SNAVE” – not a word.  
“SMAVE” – not a word.  
“SBAVE” – not a word.

The only remaining possibility that is a common English word and fits all constraints is “SUAVE”. Let me check:
- S U A V E – letters U and V: U has never been tried or ruled out, V is confirmed in position 4.
- U is allowed (not in the banned list).

Thus “SUAVE” is the only viable remaining word.
