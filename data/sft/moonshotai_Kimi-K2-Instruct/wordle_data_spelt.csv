For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

A classic strong opening word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters in different positions that will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:  
- S is in the correct first position (✓).  
- L, T, and E all appear in the word but are in the wrong positions (-).  
- A is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern:  
S _ _ _ _

Letters still available: L, T, E (plus any others not ruled out).

I now want a word that starts with S, avoids A, and re-uses L, T, and E in new positions. A good candidate is ""STELE"" — but that repeats E, which is inefficient. Another is ""STOKE"", but it brings in O and K, which weren’t tested yet. I’ll go with ""STOLE"" because it:
- Keeps S in the first slot.  
- Uses L, T, and E in positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively (different from the first guess).  
- Introduces O in the fourth spot to test another vowel.

Let’s consolidate the information we have so far.

1. Positions known:
   - Position 1 (S): ✓ confirmed.
   - Position 5 (L): ✓ confirmed.

2. Letters in word but in wrong positions:
   - T (wrong on positions 3 and 2 so far).
   - E (wrong on positions 5 and 4 so far).

3. Letters definitively absent:
   - A, O.

4. Pattern so far: S _ _ _ L

5. Remaining letters to place: T and E must each appear once more (since they were marked “-” twice, meaning they exist in the word), and they must occupy positions 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s list possible placements without repeating T or E:
- T cannot be 2 or 3; E cannot be 4 or 5.
- E will fit in 2 or 3.
- T will fit in 2, 3, or 4.

So valid patterns:
S E T _ L
S T E _ L
S _ E T L  (but position 4 would have to accept T, which is ok)

Also we need a 5-letter English word fitting one of these patterns.

One word that matches S E T _ L is ""SETAL"", but that uses an A (already excluded).

Another that matches S T E _ L is ""STEEL"" – but that doubles the E and T, which might still be valid if the hidden word allows duplicates (but our prior feedback didn’t state any duplicates, so safer to avoid).

A better fit is ""STEAL"" – but again A is excluded.

""STELL"" – double L already ruled out.

""SHELF"" – introduces new letters H and F, yet preserves the known positions and avoids banned letters.

However, we still need to place T and E once each. Let’s try:

""STEIL"" – not a common word.

""SPELT"" – that would place E in position 2 and T in position 4, yielding pattern S E _ T L, i.e., ""SPELT"". This is a valid 5-letter word, uses each of T and E once in allowed positions, and introduces P and another E (but only one new letter). This seems a strong third guess.

Wait — ""SPELT"" has T in position 4 and L in position 5, which is already confirmed. E is in 2. S is in 1. The letter P is untested. That looks good.
