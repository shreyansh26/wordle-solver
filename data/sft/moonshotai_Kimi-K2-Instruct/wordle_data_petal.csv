For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good distribution of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to start with words that contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Some good starting options include:
- ""AROSE"" (covers 5 very common letters)
- ""RAISE"" 
- ""SLATE""
- ""CRANE""

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good potential to discover multiple letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in wrong position (was position 1)
- R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in wrong position (was position 5)

Key takeaways:
1. Must contain letters: A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
2. Must NOT contain: R, O, S
3. Still need info on other consonants: T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words with A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5) and avoiding R,O,S. Good candidates:
- ""TREAD"" (has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S) – but R is excluded, so no
- ""PLATE"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S
- ""CRANE"" – but R is excluded
- ""PLANE"" – but R is excluded (N is okay)
- ""TALON"" – but O is excluded
- ""CLEAN"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S

""CLEAN"" seems good as it contains A (position 3), E (position 4), and introduces C, L, N.

From the newest feedback on DELTA:

- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 5)

Important deductions:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2 = E
   - Position 4 = A

2. Word must contain:
   - L (cannot be in position 3)
   - T (cannot be in position 4)

3. Word must NOT contain:
   - R, O, S, C, N, D

4. Allowed letters remaining (from alphabet, excluding banned ones):
   - Vowels: I, U  
   - Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y

5. Word pattern so far:
   _ E _ A _

6. We need to place L and T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but L cannot be 3, so L must be 1 or 5; T must be 1, 3, or 5, but cannot be 4).

7. Possibilities:
   - If L is in position 1: L E _ A _
     Then T must go in position 3 or 5.
     - L E T A _ → but T cannot be in position 4 (which it isn't), but we need a 5th letter.
     - L E _ A T → T in position 5.
     The missing letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters (F, G, H, etc.).

   - If L is in position 5: _ E _ A L
     Then T must go in position 1 or 3.
     - T E _ A L → T in position 1.
     - _ E T A L → T in position 3.

Let me check possible valid words:

Option 1: L E _ A T → need a letter for position 3.
Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
Example: L E G A T (LEGAT – not a valid English word)
L E F A T – invalid
L E M A T – invalid
L E K A T – invalid

Option 2: _ E T A L → need a letter for position 1.
Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, T, L
But T and L are already used in other positions.
Example: H E T A L (HETAL – not valid)
V E T A L (VETAL – not valid)
F E T A L – FETAL is valid!

Option 3: T E _ A L → need a letter for position 3.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,petal,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A common strategy is to start with words that contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Some good starting options include:
- ""AROSE"" (covers 5 very common letters)
- ""RAISE"" 
- ""SLATE""
- ""CRANE""

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good potential to discover multiple letters in the secret word.

- A is in the word but in wrong position (was position 1)
- R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in wrong position (was position 5)

Key takeaways:
1. Must contain letters: A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
2. Must NOT contain: R, O, S
3. Still need info on other consonants: T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words with A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5) and avoiding R,O,S. Good candidates:
- ""TREAD"" (has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S) – but R is excluded, so no
- ""PLATE"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S
- ""CRANE"" – but R is excluded
- ""PLANE"" – but R is excluded (N is okay)
- ""TALON"" – but O is excluded
- ""CLEAN"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S

""CLEAN"" seems good as it contains A (position 3), E (position 4), and introduces C, L, N.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CLEAN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback (CLEAN):
- C(x)  – C is NOT in the word  
- L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 2)  
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 3)  
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)  
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word  

Known facts:
1. Word contains: A (fixed at position 4)  
2. Word contains: L and E (positions not yet known)  
3. Word does NOT contain: R, O, S, C, N  
4. From first guess: A is somewhere other than position 1 (now fixed at position 4)  
5. From first guess: E is somewhere other than position 5 (now also not position 3)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ A _  
We still need three consonants plus the letters L and E.

Possible positions for L and E: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but E ≠ 3 and 5, so E must be at 1, 2).

Let’s try a word that places L and E in possible positions while introducing new consonants (D, T, Y, H, M, etc.).

Candidate: “DELTA”
- D(new), E(acceptable positions 1–2), L(acceptable positions except 2), T(new), A(fixed at 4).  
- Lets test this pattern: D E _ A L would fit L at 5 and E at 2.  
- DELTA itself: D E L T A. Check whether it violates any constraints:  
  – contains D, E, L, T, A  
  – avoids excluded letters R, O, S, C, N  
  – has A at position 4 (correct)  
  – positions of E and L are allowed.  

Seems valid and informative.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good distribution of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to start with words that contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Some good starting options include:
- ""AROSE"" (covers 5 very common letters)
- ""RAISE"" 
- ""SLATE""
- ""CRANE""

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good potential to discover multiple letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in wrong position (was position 1)
- R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in wrong position (was position 5)

Key takeaways:
1. Must contain letters: A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
2. Must NOT contain: R, O, S
3. Still need info on other consonants: T, L, N, C, D, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words with A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5) and avoiding R,O,S. Good candidates:
- ""TREAD"" (has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S) – but R is excluded, so no
- ""PLATE"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S
- ""CRANE"" – but R is excluded
- ""PLANE"" – but R is excluded (N is okay)
- ""TALON"" – but O is excluded
- ""CLEAN"" – has A not in 1, E not in 5, avoids R,O,S

""CLEAN"" seems good as it contains A (position 3), E (position 4), and introduces C, L, N.

<guess>CLEAN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CLEAN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback (CLEAN):
- C(x)  – C is NOT in the word  
- L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 2)  
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 3)  
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)  
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word  

Known facts:
1. Word contains: A (fixed at position 4)  
2. Word contains: L and E (positions not yet known)  
3. Word does NOT contain: R, O, S, C, N  
4. From first guess: A is somewhere other than position 1 (now fixed at position 4)  
5. From first guess: E is somewhere other than position 5 (now also not position 3)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ A _  
We still need three consonants plus the letters L and E.

Possible positions for L and E: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but E ≠ 3 and 5, so E must be at 1, 2).

Let’s try a word that places L and E in possible positions while introducing new consonants (D, T, Y, H, M, etc.).

Candidate: “DELTA”
- D(new), E(acceptable positions 1–2), L(acceptable positions except 2), T(new), A(fixed at 4).  
- Lets test this pattern: D E _ A L would fit L at 5 and E at 2.  
- DELTA itself: D E L T A. Check whether it violates any constraints:  
  – contains D, E, L, T, A  
  – avoids excluded letters R, O, S, C, N  
  – has A at position 4 (correct)  
  – positions of E and L are allowed.  

Seems valid and informative.

Guess 3: DELTA -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) L(-) T(-) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the newest feedback on DELTA:

- D(x) – D is NOT in the word  
- E(✓) – E is in the word **and in the correct position** (position 2)  
- L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 3)  
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 4)  
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 5)

Important deductions:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2 = E
   - Position 4 = A

2. Word must contain:
   - L (cannot be in position 3)
   - T (cannot be in position 4)

3. Word must NOT contain:
   - R, O, S, C, N, D

4. Allowed letters remaining (from alphabet, excluding banned ones):
   - Vowels: I, U  
   - Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y

5. Word pattern so far:
   _ E _ A _

6. We need to place L and T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but L cannot be 3, so L must be 1 or 5; T must be 1, 3, or 5, but cannot be 4).

7. Possibilities:
   - If L is in position 1: L E _ A _
     Then T must go in position 3 or 5.
     - L E T A _ → but T cannot be in position 4 (which it isn't), but we need a 5th letter.
     - L E _ A T → T in position 5.
     The missing letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters (F, G, H, etc.).

   - If L is in position 5: _ E _ A L
     Then T must go in position 1 or 3.
     - T E _ A L → T in position 1.
     - _ E T A L → T in position 3.

Let me check possible valid words:

Option 1: L E _ A T → need a letter for position 3.
Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
Example: L E G A T (LEGAT – not a valid English word)
L E F A T – invalid
L E M A T – invalid
L E K A T – invalid
L E V A T – invalid
L E H A T – invalid

Option 2: _ E T A L → need a letter for position 1.
Possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, T, L
But T and L are already used in other positions.
Example: H E T A L (HETAL – not valid)
V E T A L (VETAL – not valid)
F E T A L – FETAL is valid!

Option 3: T E _ A L → need a letter for position 3.
Same as above: T E G A L – invalid
T E H A L – invalid
T E M A L – invalid
T E K A L – invalid
T E V A L – invalid

Option 4: L E T A _ → need a letter for position 5.
L E T A _ → _ must be from allowed letters, but also must include L and T.
But L and T are already placed here, so the 5th letter must be new.
But we already have L, E, T, A – missing one letter.
This seems messy.

""FETAL"" seems to fit perfectly:
- F (new letter), E (position 2, ✓), T (position 3, allowed since it's not position 4), A (position 4, ✓), L (position 5).
- Contains required letters: E, A, L, T
- Does not contain banned letters: R, O, S, C, N, D
- All letters are valid English word.

From the latest feedback on METAL:
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word  
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)  
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)  
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)  
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)  

So the pattern is now fully determined except for position 1:
_ E T A L

Letters already eliminated from position 1:
- R, O, S, C, N, D, F, M

Remaining consonants for position 1:  
B, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Scanning 5-letter words that fit “?ETAL”:
- BETAL – not a valid English word  
- GETAL – not valid  
- HETAL – not valid  
- JETAL – not valid  
- KETAL – not valid  
- PETAL – valid English word  

Only PETAL remains. Since P has not been ruled out yet, and it forms a valid 5-letter word, this must be the secret word.
