For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. Words like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it has:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowels in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) to cover other frequent letters
- This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not present (x)
- R: correct position (✓)
- O: correct position (✓)
- S: not present (x)  
- E: not present (x)

So we already know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, S, E

We need a 5-letter word whose 2nd letter is R and 3rd letter is O, and that avoids A, S, E.

Some possibilities:
- B R O W N
- C R O W N
- D R O P S – but it contains S, so invalid
- F R O N T
- G R O U T
- P R O U D
- T R O P E – but it contains E, so invalid
- V R O O M – double O, but that’s allowed

Let’s pick a word that covers a few new high-frequency consonants and vowels (I, U). “FRONT” fits the pattern: _ R O _ _, contains no A/S/E, and adds F, N, T. However, F is a bit lower in frequency. “CROWN” uses C, W, N. “BROWN” uses B, W, N. Between those, “CROWN” gives us C, W, N. Let’s go with CROWN.

Current known facts:

1. Pattern: C R O _ _
   (Letters 1, 2, 3 are definitely C, R, O in those positions.)

2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, S, E, W.

3. Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (feedback shows N(-)).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with C R O
- does NOT contain A, S, E, W
- DOES contain N somewhere other than the last spot

Possible 4th & 5th letters:
Because N must appear somewhere, and can’t be 5th, it must be 4th.  
That locks the 4th letter as N, and leaves any non-forbidden letter for 5th.

Candidate letters available (excluding A, S, E, W and using each only once):
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, Y
Remaining vowels: I, U

Putting N in 4th gives:
C R O N _

Need a 5th letter that is not A, S, E, W, and isn’t already used (C, R, O, N).

Simple choices for 5th letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, Y.

Some valid words:
- CRONY
- CRONE – invalid (E is excluded)
- CRONK – uncommon
- CROND – uncommon
- CRONI – not a valid English word

The most common valid word here is CRONY.

Check against constraints:
- C(✓), R(✓), O(✓) already correct positions
- N in 4th position satisfies “N is in word but not at 5th”
- Y is a new letter to test
- No forbidden letters (A, S, E, W) appear.

Therefore, next guess is CRONY.
