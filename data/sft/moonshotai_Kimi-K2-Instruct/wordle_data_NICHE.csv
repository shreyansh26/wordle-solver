2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. A common strategy is to choose a word that uses frequently occurring letters in English to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are among the most common. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it uses five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This provides a good baseline for eliminating or confirming multiple letters in subsequent guesses.

However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters but positions the 'S' and 'T' differently. 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word that should give good information about the presence/absence of these five letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position.  
So the secret word ends in E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with no A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants left to use: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (since A and O are out, and E is fixed).

Possible patterns: ** _ _ _ _ E **, with letters from {T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, I, U, Y, ...}.

A balanced word would use common remaining letters.  
""UNTIE"" is invalid (S is not allowed, but U, N, T, I, E are okay, but T is 4th and E is 5th - but it has an S in history? No - S is banned).  
Wait, ""UNTIE"" has no banned letters (A,R,O,S are banned) and ends in E, but T is allowed.  
But ""UNTIE"" would be U N T I E - all letters allowed so far. 

Another candidate: ""INITE"" - but not a valid word.  
""ELITE"" - but R is banned, no R here, but L, I, T, E are allowed.  
""ELITE"" - E L I T E - but E is already in correct position (5th), so the first E would be wrong.  
But the first E could still be in the word elsewhere. However, E is confirmed only in the 5th position.  

""WHITE"" - W H I T E - all letters allowed (no A,R,O,S), ends in E.  
""CHIME"" - C H I M E - all letters allowed, ends in E.  
""FLUTE"" - F L U T E - but F is not as common.

""UNTIE"" seems valid - U N T I E - all letters allowed, ends in E, no A,R,O,S.  

But ""UNTIE"" is a valid word, uses U, N, T, I, E.  

Another good one: ""CUBED"" - but D is not confirmed, and E is last.  
But ""CUBED"" ends in D, not E.

Better: ""CHIME"" - C H I M E - uses C, H, I, M, E - all allowed.  
""UNTIE"" - U N T I E - uses U, N, T, I, E - all allowed.

- E is in the word and is in the correct position.  
So the secret word ends in E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with no A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants left to use: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (since A and O are out, and E is fixed).

Possible patterns: ** _ _ _ _ E **, with letters from {T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, I, U, Y, ...}.

A balanced word would use common remaining letters.  
""UNTIE"" is invalid (S is not allowed, but U, N, T, I, E are okay, but T is 4th and E is 5th - but it has an S in history? No - S is banned).  
Wait, ""UNTIE"" has no banned letters (A,R,O,S are banned) and ends in E, but T is allowed.  
But ""UNTIE"" would be U N T I E - all letters allowed so far. 

Another candidate: ""INITE"" - but not a valid word.  
""ELITE"" - but R is banned, no R here, but L, I, T, E are allowed.  
""ELITE"" - E L I T E - but E is already in correct position (5th), so the first E would be wrong.  
But the first E could still be in the word elsewhere. However, E is confirmed only in the 5th position.  

""WHITE"" - W H I T E - all letters allowed (no A,R,O,S), ends in E.  
""CHIME"" - C H I M E - all letters allowed, ends in E.  
""FLUTE"" - F L U T E - but F is not as common.

""UNTIE"" seems valid - U N T I E - all letters allowed, ends in E, no A,R,O,S.  

But ""UNTIE"" is a valid word, uses U, N, T, I, E.  

Another good one: ""CUBED"" - but D is not confirmed, and E is last.  
But ""CUBED"" ends in D, not E.

Better: ""CHIME"" - C H I M E - uses C, H, I, M, E - all allowed.  
""UNTIE"" - U N T I E - uses U, N, T, I, E - all allowed.  

Between these, ""UNTIE"" uses slightly more common letters (N, T, I, U).  

I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

4. Therefore, word pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and must contain both N and I (from the “-” feedback), while avoiding A, R, O, S, U, T.

Possible remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels: only I is confirmed inside somewhere; E is fixed at the end.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in E that includes both N and I (each at least once) and uses none of the banned letters.

Candidate words:
- LINED – uses L, I, N, E, D → valid (L, I, N, D allowed, E at end).
- MINCE – uses M, I, N, C, E → valid.
- WINED – uses W, I, N, E, D → valid.
- PINED – uses P, I, N, E, D → valid.

Among these, “MINCE” is common and spreads the letters nicely across positions 1–5 (except E at 5).

Let’s pick MINCE.

From the new feedback:
- I is now locked into position 2 (✓).
- N is somewhere in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- C is somewhere in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- M is NOT in the word (x).
- E is locked into position 5 (✓).
- Still banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, M.

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ E
with required letters: N (not in pos 3) and C (not in pos 4).

Remaining usable consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: none left (only I and E are allowed).

Possible word: _ I _ _ E with N and C inside.

Let’s list valid placements:
- N cannot be position 3.
- C cannot be position 4.

Possibilities:
1. N in pos 1: N I _ _ E → but then C must fit in pos 3 or 4.
   - NICKE: not a word
   - NINJE: not a word
   - NIPCE: not a word
   - NICLE: not a word
   - NINFE: not a word
2. N in pos 2: but pos 2 is I.
3. N in pos 4: _ I _ N E → then C must fit in pos 1 or 3.
   - C I _ N E → C I _ N E → C I N N E (invalid double N)
   - C I K N E → C I K N E (not a word)
   - D I C N E → D I C N E (not a word)
   - F I C N E (not a word)
4. N in pos 3: but feedback says N is not in pos 3 (-).

So N must be in pos 1 or 4.

Looking at valid words:
- N I C K E → NICKE (not a recognized word)
- N I D G E → NIDGE (valid British spelling for ""nudge"")
- N I P P E → NIPPE (not a word)
- V I N C E → VINCE (valid name, but is it a valid word? Yes, short for Vincent, but is it a standalone word? Maybe not.)
- W I N C E → WINCE (valid word meaning to flinch)

""WINCE"" fits:
- W I N C E
- W is allowed
- I is in pos 2 (✓)
- N is in pos 3 → but feedback says N is not in pos 3 (-). So this is invalid.

Wait, N in pos 3 is invalid (from feedback). So N must be in pos 1 or 4.

""NIDGE"" fits:
- N I D G E
- N is in pos 1 (allowed)
- I is in pos 2 (✓)
- D is allowed
- G is allowed
- E is in pos 5 (✓)

We must have both N and C in the word. Let me re-examine.

Pattern: _ I _ _ E
Letters to include: N and C
Letters to avoid: A, R, O, S, U, T, M
Positions:
- N cannot be in pos 3
- C cannot be in pos 4

Possible placements:
- N in pos 1: N I _ _ E
   Then C must be in pos 3 or 4 (but 4 is banned for C), so pos 3:
   N I C _ E → NIC_E → NICHE (valid word: N I C H E)
   Check: N is in pos 1 (allowed), C is in pos 3 (allowed), H is allowed, E is pos 5 (✓).
   This seems correct.

- N in pos 4: _ I _ N E
   Then C must be in pos 1 or 3:
   - C I _ N E → C I _ N E → C I K N E (not a word)
   - _ I C N E → possible: V I C N E (not a word), D I C N E (not a word)
   No valid words found here.

Thus, the only valid candidate appears to be NICHE.

Check NICHE:
- N I C H E
- N: pos 1 (allowed)
- I: pos 2 (✓)
- C: pos 3 (allowed, since C cannot be in pos 4)
- H: pos 4 (allowed)
