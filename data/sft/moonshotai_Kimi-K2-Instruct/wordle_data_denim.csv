For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'm going with ""SLATE"" as it has:
1. S (very common starting letter and consonant)
2. L (common consonant)
3. A (most common vowel)
4. T (very common consonant)
5. E (most common ending letter and vowel)

This combination should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

The feedback from SLATE tells us:

- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x for each).  
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does **not** contain S, L, A, T.
2. It **does** contain E, but E is not in the fifth position.
3. We need to test new consonants and vowels.

Good next step is to test common letters that weren’t tried yet: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses E in a different position (not last).
- Avoids the eliminated letters S/L/A/T.
- Introduces other high-frequency letters.

A strong candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, R, O, E – none of the forbidden letters.
- E is in position 4, satisfying the feedback.
- Tests new common consonants C, H, R plus the vowels O and E.

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
   (those showed an “x”, so they are not in the word at all).

2. E is confirmed to be in the word, but it is **not** in the 5th position (from both guesses) and **not** in the 4th position (from CHORE), so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been eliminated.  
   Remaining frequent letters: D, N, I, U, G, M, K, P, B, F, Y, etc.

4. A word that uses only letters not yet eliminated and places E somewhere new would be ideal.  
   A good candidate is “UNPEN”:
   - Letters used: U, N, P, E, N  
   - All letters are still possible (none of S,L,A,T,C,H,O,R)  
   - Puts E in the 4th position, which we already know is wrong for E, so that’s a waste.

   Instead, let’s put E in the 2nd position and test other letters:  
   “DINGE” is out because we haven’t confirmed D, I, N, G.  
   “FUDGE” uses F, U, D, G, E – but D and G are less likely.  
   “MIDGE” is similar.  

   A simpler word that uses E in the 2nd position and introduces new common letters is “NEVER” – but R is already eliminated.

   Next option: “BUDDY” – eliminates D, U, B.  
   “PIECE” – C is eliminated.  

   A better fit is “MIDGE” – but M, I, D, G, E: all possible except we’re not sure about G.  

   Let me pick a word that contains E in the 2nd position and uses other common remaining letters:  
   “BEDEW” – B, E, D, E, W.  
   But W is less common, and we’d test D and W.

   Another option is “FINED” – F, I, N, E, D.  
   This tests F, I, N, D and places E in 4th (already wrong).  

   A better placement is “INFER” – but uses F, I, N, E, R (R eliminated).

   Let me choose “INFER” without the R – but that’s not possible.  

   Actually, let’s place E in the 2nd position and use B, I, N, D:  
   “BINED” is not a valid word.  

   Next candidate: “DENIM” – D, E, N, I, M.  
   It’s valid, and we place E in 2nd, test D, N, I, M – none eliminated.

   So “DENIM” is a strong next guess.
