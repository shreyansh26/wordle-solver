For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly help narrow down the possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Common choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU,"" but these might use less common letters. 

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- It's a valid English word
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

From the first feedback:

1. R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
2. E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th, so it must be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th).
3. A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word looks like: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we can exclude: A, O, S
- Letters we need to test: E must go somewhere else (1st, 3rd, or 4th position), and we need new consonants and vowels.

Good letters to test next: T, I, N, L, C, etc. Since E must be somewhere else, let's try placing it in 3rd position (common for ""E""). Then we need two more consonants.

A good next guess would be ""TRIED"":
- T (new consonant)
- R (correct, stays)
- I (new vowel)
- E (must be here since it was - in 5th)
- D (new consonant)

But wait, E was - (in word but wrong position) and we had it in 5th, so it could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th. Putting it in 3rd is a good test. However, ""TRIED"" uses D which is fine, but maybe better to test more common letters.

Alternative: ""CRIME"":
- C, M are new consonants
- I is new vowel
- E is now in 4th position (testing another spot)
- R stays

But ""CRIME"" is okay, but let's think better. Since we know no A, O, S, and R is 2nd, and E is somewhere, let's try ""FRESH"":
- F, H are new
- E is in 1st position
- S is excluded, so this is bad.

""GREET"":
- G, T new
- E in 3rd
- But double E, not ideal for first few guesses.

""BRIDE"":
- B new
- I new vowel
- D new
- E in 4th
- R stays

This seems good - tests B, I, D, and moves E to 4th.

But actually, let's think more systematically. We have _ R _ _ _, and letters to exclude: A, O, S. E must be in 1,3, or 4.

- E is now in 4th position (testing another spot)
- R stays

But ""CRIME"" is okay, but let's think better. Since we know no A, O, S, and R is 2nd, and E is somewhere, let's try ""FRESH"":
- F, H are new
- E is in 1st position
- S is excluded, so this is bad.

""GREET"":
- G, T new
- E in 3rd
- But double E, not ideal for first few guesses.

""BRIDE"":
- B new
- I new vowel
- D new
- E in 4th
- R stays

This seems good - tests B, I, D, and moves E to 4th.

But actually, let's think more systematically. We have _ R _ _ _, and letters to exclude: A, O, S. E must be in 1,3, or 4.

Let's try ""DRIVE"":
- D, V new
- I new vowel
- E in 5th again (but we know E is not 5th, so this is bad)

""PRICE"":
- P, C new
- I new
- E in 4th
- R stays

This looks good. Tests P, C, I, and moves E to 4th.

I think ""PRICE"" is a solid next guess.

We need two more consonants (or a consonant + a vowel) that haven’t been tested yet. Good untested common consonants include T, N, L, D, G, B, F, H, M, K, etc.

Let’s try to put E in slot 4 (common pattern):
 _ R I E _

From the three guesses we now have:

Pattern: _ R I E _
Letters definitely in: R (2), I (3), E (4)
Letters known absent: A, O, S, P, C, T, D

We still need:
- A first letter (position 1) that hasn’t been tested yet.
- A fifth letter (position 5) that hasn’t been tested yet.

Good untested consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Good untested vowels: U (only vowel not yet tried).

Since every vowel except U has been ruled out or placed, position 5 must be a consonant. We also need a consonant for position 1.

Let’s list the viable letters for each blank:

1st letter: any consonant not yet used (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.)
5th letter: any consonant not yet used (same pool)

We want a real five-letter word that matches _ R I E _. Scanning common patterns, likely candidates are:

- BRIEF
- FRIED (but D is out)
- GRIEF
- BRIER (but R already used twice)
- CRIER (C is out)
- PRIED (P and D out)
- WRIER (W, R already twice)
- CRIED (C and D out)

The cleanest valid words remaining seem to be BRIEF and GRIEF.

Between them, let’s choose BRIEF: both B and F are new, and it’s a common word.

If BRIEF fails, we’ll know more about B or F.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Common choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU,"" but these might use less common letters. 

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- It's a valid English word
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:

1. R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
2. E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th, so it must be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th).
3. A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word looks like: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we can exclude: A, O, S
- Letters we need to test: E must go somewhere else (1st, 3rd, or 4th position), and we need new consonants and vowels.

Good letters to test next: T, I, N, L, C, etc. Since E must be somewhere else, let's try placing it in 3rd position (common for ""E""). Then we need two more consonants.

A good next guess would be ""TRIED"":
- T (new consonant)
- R (correct, stays)
- I (new vowel)
- E (must be here since it was - in 5th)
- D (new consonant)

But wait, E was - (in word but wrong position) and we had it in 5th, so it could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th. Putting it in 3rd is a good test. However, ""TRIED"" uses D which is fine, but maybe better to test more common letters.

Alternative: ""CRIME"":
- C, M are new consonants
- I is new vowel
- E is now in 4th position (testing another spot)
- R stays

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ R I E _
- Letters in the word and positions: R (2), I (3), E (4), F (5)
- Letters ruled out: A, B, C, D, O, P, S, T
- Only position 1 is unknown; it must be a consonant not yet used.

Untested consonants still available: G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

The only remaining slot is the first letter. We need a common consonant that hasn’t been tried yet. Likely choices include G, H, K, L, M, N, etc.

Common 5-letter words ending in RIEF are limited:
- GRIEF (G is untested)
- CRIEF (but C is out)
- No other common words fit.

Thus, GRIEF is the obvious next choice. It uses G, which hasn’t been tested yet, and fits the pattern perfectly.

If GRIEF is correct, we’ll have the answer. If not, we’ll know G is also excluded, which would narrow it down further.
