- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I need to choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. The best first guesses typically:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoid repeating letters to get more information per guess
3. Cover as many common letters as possible

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess would use 5 different common letters.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common ones
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It forms a valid English word
- It covers 5 of the top 7 most common letters in 5-letter words

This should give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
1. A(-) → A is in the word but not in the first position.
2. R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
3. O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
4. S(-) → S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
5. E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has A and S, but A is not first and S is not fourth.
- The word does NOT have R, O, or E.
- So far the allowed letters we know are: A, S.
- We still need 3 more letters, none of which are R, O, or E.

Common consonants still allowed: T, L, N, C, H, D, P, etc.
Common vowels still allowed: I, U. (A is already known to be in the word.)

We need a word that:
- Uses A and S.
- Does not use R, O, E.
- Has A not in the first position.
- Has S not in the fourth position.

A good strategy now is to choose a word that:
- Places A in a different position (not first).
- Places S in a different position (not fourth).
- Introduces new common letters.

Good candidates include: ""saint"" (but E is excluded), ""slant"" (but R is excluded), ""staid"" (but E is excluded). 

Let's try ""slain"":
- S is first (allowed since S can't be fourth, but can be first).
- L is new and common.
- A is third (not first, so allowed).
- I is new and common (vowel).
- N is new and common.

This covers S, A, L, I, N - all common letters and valid given the constraints.
