Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. My best strategy is to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the amount of information I can gain. Some of the most common letters in 5-letter English words are vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good opening word should contain a mix of these common letters. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This maximizes the chance that I'll get some positive feedback (either ✓ or -) which I can use to narrow down subsequent guesses.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong because it uses 5 unique letters from the top 10 most frequent letters in English words.

From the feedback for AROSE:
- A – not in word (x)
- R – in word, wrong position (-)
- O – in word, wrong position (-)
- S – not in word (x)
- E – not in word (x)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, S, or E.
- Contains R and O, but neither is in the spot they occupied in AROSE (R in position 2, O in position 3).

Therefore:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- We can use any other letters except A, S, E.

I want a word that moves R and O to new positions and introduces new common consonants (T, N, L, etc.) plus any remaining vowels (I, U). A word like “FRONT” would place R in position 2 again, violating the feedback, so that’s out. Choosing “TROOP” repeats O in two spots and has double letters, which is less informative.

A good second-guess candidate is “BROTH”:
- B – new consonant, common in words
- R – moved to position 1 (allowed)
- O – moved to position 2 (allowed)
- T – new common consonant
- H – new consonant, common in many patterns

This keeps R and O in new positions and brings in fresh letters to test.

My best strategy is to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the amount of information I can gain. Some of the most common letters in 5-letter English words are vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.\n\nA good opening word should contain a mix of these common letters. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This maximizes the chance that I\'ll get some positive feedback (either ✓ or -) which I can use to narrow down subsequent guesses.\n\nOther good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong because it uses 5 unique letters from the top 10 most frequent letters in English words.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback for AROSE:\n- A – not in word (x)\n- R – in word, wrong position (-)\n- O – in word, wrong position (-)\n- S – not in word (x)\n- E – not in word (x)\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Does NOT contain A, S, or E.\n- Contains R and O, but neither is in the spot they occupied in AROSE (R in position 2, O in position 3).\n\nTherefore:\n- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- We can use any other letters except A, S, E.\n\nI want a word that moves R and O to new positions and introduces new common consonants (T, N, L, etc.) plus any remaining vowels (I, U). A word like “FRONT” would place R in position 2 again, violating the feedback, so that’s out. Choosing “TROOP” repeats O in two spots and has double letters, which is less informative.\n\nA good second-guess candidate is “BROTH”:\n- B – new consonant, common in words\n- R – moved to position 1 (allowed)\n- O – moved to position 2 (allowed)\n- T – new common consonant\n- H – new consonant, common in many patterns\n\nThis keeps R and O in new positions and brings in fresh letters to test.\n\n<guess>BROTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BROTH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) O(-) T(x) H(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

From the new feedback we now know exact positions:

H (position 1) ✓  
U (position 2) x  
M (position 3) x  
O (position 4) ✓  
R (position 5) ✓  

Therefore the secret word is: H _ _ O R where blanks are neither A, S, E, B, T, U, M.

Available letters: C, D, F, G, I, K, L, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must be H _ _ O R. Common consonants for positions 2 & 3: C, L, N, D, G, F…

Likely combinations:
- H C O R … but needs 5 letters → H C ? O R
- H I C O R – not common
- H O R … but O already used
- H O N O R → H O N O R – but we have O fixed at position 4, so H O N O R is H(1)O(2)N(3)O(4)R(5) – that fits and uses allowed letters.

"" HONOR "" satisfies:
H(1) ✓ fixed  
O(4) ✓ fixed  
R(5) ✓ fixed  
N(3) new  
O(2) but O already placed correctly at 4, so O at 2 is acceptable if the word allows double letters.

HONOR is a real English 5-letter word, uses only letters not yet excluded, and matches all the positional information.
