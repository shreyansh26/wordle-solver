For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This gives us a good mix of letters that appear frequently in English words and should provide helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.
