For the first guess, there's no prior feedback to build upon, so the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good first guess often includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, I, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Current state:
- Letters we know **must** be in the word: I (but **not** in position 3 or 5).
- Letters we know are **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L.

Remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels (not yet ruled out): O (the only vowel left that hasn’t been tried).

So the word must contain I somewhere except positions 3 and 5, and can only use the remaining letters plus I and O.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word with:
1. I in position 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).  
2. Only uses letters from the allowed set {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O}.  
3. Is a valid English word.

Possible I placements:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ I _ _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ I _

Let’s think of common words meeting these constraints:
- IDIOM? → Has D, M, O. I in position 1 and 3 → position 3 is invalid (I must not be there).  
- MIMIC? → Has M, C. I in position 2 and 4 → valid placement for I in 2 and 4, but let’s check: M I M I C. The second I is in position 4 (valid), first I in position 2 (valid).  
  However, we already used this I twice, which is fine, but we need to confirm this word is allowed.  
  But we prefer to test new letters if possible.

Alternative: PIVOT? → P, V, O, T. T is already ruled out (x in feedback).  
Another: VIGOR? → V, G, O, R. R is ruled out.

Another approach: focus on position 2 for I.  
Possible: _ I _ _ _.  
Examples:  
- BIOME? → B, I, O, M, E. E is ruled out.  
- CIGAR? → C, I, G, A, R. A and R are ruled out.  
- FILMY? → F, I, L, M, Y. L is ruled out.

Another: focus on position 4: _ _ _ I _.  
Examples:  
- BOGIE? → B, O, G, I, E. E is ruled out.  
- DOGIE? → D, O, G, I, E. E is ruled out.  
- FOCI? Too short (4 letters).  

Let’s try: MIMIC.  
Letters used: M, I (positions 2 and 4), and C.  
- I is in valid positions (2 and 4).  
- No disallowed letters (A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L are avoided).  
- M and C have not been used before.  

This seems like the best available next guess.

From the latest feedback (MIMIC):

M(x) → M is **not** in the word (confirmed)  
I(-) → I is in the word **but wrong position** for position 4 – **contradicts** the ✓ we just saw for position 2.  
C(x) → C is **not** in the word

Important note: the ✓ on position 2 overrides the “-” on position 4 for the same letter.  
So the word is now known to have:
- I in position 2
- Letters **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L, M, C  
- Remaining legal letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, O (only O left among vowels)

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
_ I _ _ _
using only the remaining legal letters (and O only once if at all).

List of possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates:

- JIFFY seems to fit all constraints.

Let me double-check JIFFY:
Letters: J, I, F, F, Y

- Fits pattern _ I _ _ _ with I in position 2.  
- Repeats F twice but that’s fine.

Another candidate: PIZZO?  Z allowed, O allowed, but second Z and final O: P I Z Z O – but double Z and final O is OK.  However, PIZZO is slang/variant and may not be accepted in some dictionaries.  JIFFY is common.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good first guess often includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, I, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WIDOW,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, there's no prior feedback to build upon, so the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good first guess often includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""ARISE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, I, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback from ARISE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: x → not in the word
- I: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

Letters to avoid: A, R, S, E  
Known letter: I (not in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter I, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Does **not** contain A, R, S, E.

A good next guess should test new common consonants and vowels while incorporating the known I. Let’s pick a word with:
- I placed somewhere except position 3
- Common remaining consonants like T, N, L, D or vowels like O, U

Candidate: ""POINT"" → P, O, I, N, T.  
- I is in position 3 → violates feedback (I must not be in 3rd position). Reject.

Candidate: ""UNTIL"" → U, N, T, I, L.  
- I is in position 4 → valid.  
- Contains none of A, R, S, E.  
- Tests U, N, T, L.

Another candidate: ""UNITY"" → U, N, I, T, Y.  
- I is in position 3 → invalid.

Best valid choice: UNTIL.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state:
- Letters we know **must** be in the word: I (but **not** in position 3 or 5).
- Letters we know are **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L.

Remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels (not yet ruled out): O (the only vowel left that hasn’t been tried).

So the word must contain I somewhere except positions 3 and 5, and can only use the remaining letters plus I and O.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word with:
1. I in position 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).  
2. Only uses letters from the allowed set {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O}.  
3. Is a valid English word.

Possible I placements:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ I _ _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ I _

Let’s think of common words meeting these constraints:
- IDIOM? → Has D, M, O. I in position 1 and 3 → position 3 is invalid (I must not be there).  
- MIMIC? → Has M, C. I in position 2 and 4 → valid placement for I in 2 and 4, but let’s check: M I M I C. The second I is in position 4 (valid), first I in position 2 (valid).  
  However, we already used this I twice, which is fine, but we need to confirm this word is allowed.  
  But we prefer to test new letters if possible.

Alternative: PIVOT? → P, V, O, T. T is already ruled out (x in feedback).  
Another: VIGOR? → V, G, O, R. R is ruled out.

Another approach: focus on position 2 for I.  
Possible: _ I _ _ _.  
Examples:  
- BIOME? → B, I, O, M, E. E is ruled out.  
- CIGAR? → C, I, G, A, R. A and R are ruled out.  
- FILMY? → F, I, L, M, Y. L is ruled out.

Another: focus on position 4: _ _ _ I _.  
Examples:  
- BOGIE? → B, O, G, I, E. E is ruled out.  
- DOGIE? → D, O, G, I, E. E is ruled out.  
- FOCI? Too short (4 letters).  

Let’s try: MIMIC.  
Letters used: M, I (positions 2 and 4), and C.  
- I is in valid positions (2 and 4).  
- No disallowed letters (A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L are avoided).  
- M and C have not been used before.  

This seems like the best available next guess.

M(x)  → M is **not** in the word

C(x) → C is **not** in the word

Important note: the ✓ on position 2 overrides the “-” on position 4 for the same letter.  
So the word is now known to have:
- I in position 2
- Letters **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, U, N, T, L, M, C  
- Remaining legal letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, O (only O left among vowels)

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
_ I _ _ _
using only the remaining legal letters (and O only once if at all).

List of possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowel left: O

Good candidates:
- DITZY?  No, I is fixed in position 2. We need _ I _ _ _.
- B I _ _ _ : BICON?  C ruled out.
- P I _ _ _ : PIVOT?  T ruled out.
- V I _ _ _ : VIGOR?  R and G available?  R is ruled out already.

- K I _ _ _ : KIOSK?  O and S.  S ruled out.
- P I _ _ _ : PIZZA?  Z allowed, but double Z and A ruled out.
- JIFFY seems to fit all constraints.

Let me double-check JIFFY:
Letters: J, I, F, F, Y  
- All letters haven’t been ruled out.  
- Fits pattern _ I _ _ _ with I in position 2.  
- Repeats F twice but that’s fine.

Another candidate: PIZZO?  Z allowed, O allowed, but second Z and final O: P I Z Z O – but double Z and final O is OK.  However, PIZZO is slang/variant and may not be accepted in some dictionaries.  JIFFY is common.
