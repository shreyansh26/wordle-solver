Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify multiple potential letters in the correct or wrong positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular starting words include:
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- ADIEU

Among these, ""STARE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- T is the 2nd most common consonant
- A and E are the most common vowels
- R is also very common
This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters without repetition.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" but ""STARE"" is slightly more balanced with the vowel placement.

From the feedback:
- S(✓) → S is in the exact 1st position, so we keep S at the start.
- T(-) → T is somewhere in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

Constraints:
1. We must have S in position 1.
2. We must have T and E somewhere in the remaining four positions, but not in their original spots (2 and 5 respectively).
3. We cannot use A or R.
4. We need two more unique letters (since we already have S, T, E).

Good candidates for the remaining letters (excluding A, R) are common English letters like L, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Let's try to place T and E in new positions:
Possible positions for T: 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let's try placing E in position 2 (since it can't be 5) and T in position 3 or 4.

Word structure: S E T _ _  or  S _ T E _

Let's try S E T _ _ first. We need two more letters. Good consonants could be L and I, making S E T L I. But this is ""SETLI"" which seems unlikely.

Another approach: Let's try S _ _ E _. For the 2nd and 3rd positions, we can use common letters like L, N, I. Let's try S L I E T - but T is in position 5 which was forbidden for E but not for T.

Wait, E can't be in position 5, but T can be in position 5. So S L I E T is possible, but that's SLIET which isn't a word.

Let's think of actual words:
- S P I T E (E is in position 4, T in 3) - but we have T(-) which means T is somewhere but not in 2. Here T is in 3 which is allowed. Also P and I are new letters.
- S P I T E seems valid.

Another option: S W E E T - but E repeats which wastes a guess.
- S H I E T - not a word.
- S T E E L - E repeats.

Let's try S P I T E:
- S is correct in position 1.
- P is new.
- I is new.
- T is in position 3 (allowed since T(-) just says not in position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed since E(-) said not in position 5).

This seems like a good balanced guess.

Alternative: S W E E T - but double E is inefficient.
Alternative: S T I E R - but R is excluded.
Alternative: S L I T E - but L is new, I is new, T in 3, E in 5 (but E can't be in 5), so this fails.

Thus, S P I T E seems the best current option.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. S is locked in 1st position.
2. T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
3. E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.
4. Letters that have been ruled out so far:  
   A, R, P, I (all marked x in one of the guesses).

So far we have:

S _ _ _ _

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- T (cannot be in position 2)
- E (cannot be in position 5)

We also need two more unique consonants/vowels that have not been tried and are not A, R, P, I.

Good remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s generate possible patterns:

Pattern choices:
- S _ _ T _   (T in 4, E must go in 2 or 3)
- S _ _ _ T   (T in 5, E must go in 2,3, or 4)
- S _ T _ _   (T in 3, E must go in 2 or 4)
- S T _ _ _   (T in 2) — but T(-) says T is not in position 2 — so this is disallowed.

Let’s try to place T in 3 and E in 4: S _ T E _.  
We need one more letter for position 2. From unused letters (not A,R,P,I), good ones are L, N, C, H, etc.

Word shape: S _ T E _

Possible word: S N T E ? — but needs to be a real 5-letter word. “SNTE_” is not valid.

Alternative placement: T in 4 and E in 2: S E _ T _.  
Possible word: S E C T _ — but “SECT_” needs one more letter. “SECTS” but that repeats S. “SECTO” not a word.

Another placement: T in 3 and E in 2: S E T _ _.  
Need two letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding A,R,P,I.  
“SETON” — a real word, uses N and O (both unused).
- S ✓
- E ✓
- T ✓ (position 3, allowed since T(-) only forbids position 2)
- O and N are new letters.

Let’s check if “SETON” obeys all constraints:
- S fixed in 1st.
- T in 3rd (allowed).
- E in 2nd (allowed).
- No A, R, P, I.
- All letters unique.

This seems good.

We also need two more unique consonants/vowels that have not been tried and are not A, R, P, I.

Good remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s generate possible patterns:

Pattern choices:
- S _ _ T _   (T in 4, E must go in 2 or 3)
- S _ _ _ T   (T in 5, E must go in 2,3, or 4)
- S _ T _ _   (T in 3, E must go in 2 or 4)
- S T _ _ _   (T in 2) — but T(-) says T is not in position 2 — so this is disallowed.

Let’s try to place T in 3 and E in 4: S _ T E _.  
We need one more letter for position 2. From unused letters (not A,R,P,I), good ones are L, N, C, H, etc.

Word shape: S _ T E _

Possible word: S N T E ? — but needs to be a real 5-letter word. “SNTE_” is not valid.

Alternative placement: T in 4 and E in 2: S E _ T _.  
Possible word: S E C T _ — but “SECT_” needs one more letter. “SECTS” but that repeats S. “SECTO” not a word.

Another placement: T in 3 and E in 2: S E T _ _.  
Need two letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding A,R,P,I.  
“SETON” — a real word, uses N and O (both unused).
- S ✓
- E ✓
- T ✓ (position 3, allowed since T(-) only forbids position 2)
- O and N are new letters.

Let’s check if “SETON” obeys all constraints:
- S fixed in 1st.
- T in 3rd (allowed).
- E in 2nd (allowed).
- No A, R, P, I.
- All letters unique.

The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify multiple potential letters in the correct or wrong positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular starting words include:
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- ADIEU

Among these, ""STARE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- T is the 2nd most common consonant
- A and E are the most common vowels
- R is also very common
This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters without repetition.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" but ""STARE"" is slightly more balanced with the vowel placement.

Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(x) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S(✓) → S is in the exact 1st position, so we keep S at the start.
- T(-) → T is somewhere in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

Constraints:
1. We must have S in position 1.
2. We must have T and E somewhere in the remaining four positions, but not in their original spots (2 and 5 respectively).
3. We cannot use A or R.
4. We need two more unique letters (since we already have S, T, E).

Good candidates for the remaining letters (excluding A, R) are common English letters like L, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Let's try to place T and E in new positions:
Possible positions for T: 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let's try placing E in position 2 (since it can't be 5) and T in position 3 or 4.

Word structure: S E T _ _  or  S _ T E _

Let's try S E T _ _ first. We need two more letters. Good consonants could be L and I, making S E T L I. But this is ""SETLI"" which seems unlikely.

Another approach: Let's try S _ _ E _. For the 2nd and 3rd positions, we can use common letters like L, N, I. Let's try S L I E T - but T is in position 5 which was forbidden for E but not for T.

Wait, E can't be in position 5, but T can be in position 5. So S L I E T is possible, but that's SLIET which isn't a word.

Let's think of actual words:
- S P I T E (E is in position 4, T in 3) - but we have T(-) which means T is somewhere but not in 2. Here T is in 3 which is allowed. Also P and I are new letters.
- S P I T E seems valid.

Another option: S W E E T - but E repeats which wastes a guess.
- S H I E T - not a word.
- S T E E L - E repeats.

Let's try S P I T E:
- S is correct in position 1.
- P is new.
- I is new.
- T is in position 3 (allowed since T(-) just says not in position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed since E(-) said not in position 5).

This seems like a good balanced guess.

Alternative: S W E E T - but double E is inefficient.
Alternative: S T I E R - but R is excluded.
Alternative: S L I T E - but L is new, I is new, T in 3, E in 5 (but E can't be in 5), so this fails.

Thus, S P I T E seems the best current option.

2. T is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
3. E is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
4. Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: A, R, P, I, O, N.

So the word looks like:

Possible positions for T:
- Allowed positions: 4 or 5 (because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for T).

Possible positions for E:

Now we have two main cases to consider:

Case 1: T in 4 and E in 5
   Word structure: S _ _ T E
   But E is allowed in 5 (only position 5 was never ruled out for E)
   However, the word would be S _ _ T E. We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding A, R, P, I, O, N.

Case 2: T in 5 and E in 3

- S H E L T → close to ""SHELT"" but no

Alternative: S W E E T - but double E is inefficient.
Alternative: S T I E R - but R is excluded.
Alternative: S L I T E - but L is new, I is new, T in 3, E in 5 (but E can't be in 5), so this fails.

Thus, S P I T E seems the best current option.

Guess 2: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. S is locked in 1st position.
2. T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
3. E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.
4. Letters that have been ruled out so far:  
   A, R, P, I (all marked x in one of the guesses).

So far we have:

S _ _ _ _

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- T (cannot be in position 2)
- E (cannot be in position 5)

We also need two more unique consonants/vowels that have not been tried and are not A, R, P, I.

Good remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s generate possible patterns:

Pattern choices:
- S _ _ T _   (T in 4, E must go in 2 or 3)
- S _ _ _ T   (T in 5, E must go in 2,3, or 4)
- S _ T _ _   (T in 3, E must go in 2 or 4)
- S T _ _ _   (T in 2) — but T(-) says T is not in position 2 — so this is disallowed.

Let’s try to place T in 3 and E in 4: S _ T E _.  
We need one more letter for position 2. From unused letters (not A,R,P,I), good ones are L, N, C, H, etc.

Word shape: S _ T E _

Possible word: S N T E ? — but needs to be a real 5-letter word. “SNTE_” is not valid.

Alternative placement: T in 4 and E in 2: S E _ T _.  
Possible word: S E C T _ — but “SECT_” needs one more letter. “SECTS” but that repeats S. “SECTO” not a word.

Another placement: T in 3 and E in 2: S E T _ _.  
Need two letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding A,R,P,I.  
“SETON” — a real word, uses N and O (both unused).
- S ✓
- E ✓
- T ✓ (position 3, allowed since T(-) only forbids position 2)
- O and N are new letters.

Let’s check if “SETON” obeys all constraints:
- S fixed in 1st.
- T in 3rd (allowed).
- E in 2nd (allowed).
- No A, R, P, I.
- All letters unique.

This seems good.

Guess 3: SETON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(-) T(-) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate all information received so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. T is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
3. E is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
4. Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: A, R, P, I, O, N.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

Possible positions for T:
- Allowed positions: 4 or 5 (because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for T).

Possible positions for E:
- Allowed positions: 3 or 5 (because positions 2 and 4 are ruled out for E).

Now we have two main cases to consider:

Case 1: T in 4 and E in 5
   Word structure: S _ _ T E
   But E is allowed in 5 (only position 5 was never ruled out for E)
   However, the word would be S _ _ T E. We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding A, R, P, I, O, N.

Case 2: T in 5 and E in 3
   Word structure: S _ E _ T
   This seems promising.

Let's explore Case 2 (S _ E _ T) first because it feels more likely to yield common words.

We need:
- Position 2: any letter except A, R, P, I, O, N
- Position 4: any letter except A, R, P, I, O, N, S, E, T

Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

Let's try to form real words with S _ E _ T:

- S L E U T → not a word
- S C E L T → not a word
- S H E L T → close to ""SHELT"" but no
- S W E L T → no
- S M E L T → ""SMELT"" is a real word (past tense of smell or a type of fish)

Let's check ""SMELT"":
- S ✓ (position 1 correct)
- M (new)
- E (position 3 - allowed)
- L (new)
- T (position 5 - allowed)

No forbidden letters, no repeats, valid word.

Another check for Case 1 (S _ _ T E):
Possible word: S L U T E → ""SLUTE"" not a word
S C U T E → ""SCUTE"" is a biological term but less common
S H U T E → not standard

Thus, ""SMELT"" seems the best next guess.

Remaining available letters (unused and not eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y

We need real 5-letter English words of the form S ? E ? T.

- S C E P T → P eliminated
- S C E S T → S repeats
- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S C E L T → L eliminated
- S C E R T → R eliminated

Looking carefully at common words:

- S C E N T → N is eliminated
- S W E E T → E repeats, invalid
- S C E P T → P eliminated
- S C E S T → S repeats
- S C E R T → R eliminated
- S C E D T → not a word
- S C E B T → not a word
- S V E S T → S repeats
- S C E N T → N eliminated

Wait, let me think of more systematically:

Actually, let's list all valid English words of the form S * E * T:

- SWEET (invalid, E repeats)
- SLEET (L eliminated)
- SWEAT (A eliminated)
- SWEPT (P eliminated)
- SWELT (invalid word)
- SKEET
- SKEET is a valid word (a type of shooting sport)

Let's check SKEET:
- S (position 1) ✓
- K (new)
- E (position 3) ✓
- E (position 4) - but we already have E in position 3, so this would be E in position 4 which is allowed but we have E already. However, letters can repeat in words even if they're marked in feedback - the feedback only tells us about that specific position. So E in position 4 is fine as long as we don't have feedback against it.

Wait, but in our constraints, E is confirmed in position 3 and there's no restriction on other Es. However, in the word SKEET, E would appear twice. Is this allowed? Yes, unless previous feedback explicitly ruled out additional Es, which it didn't.

But let's check if there's a word with distinct letters:

- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S C E D T → not a word
- S C E B T → not a word
- S C E G T → not a word

Actually, SCEAT is not a word. Let me think again.

Looking back at valid S _ E _ T words:

- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S K E E T → valid (skeet)
- S W E E T → invalid
- S C E S T → invalid
- S C E R T → R eliminated

SKEET seems to be the only valid option with current constraints. Also, K and the second E are new letters not previously eliminated.

Therefore, SKEET is the logical next guess.

Based on the feedback, the confirmed letters are:

The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify multiple potential letters in the correct or wrong positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular starting words include:
- STARE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- ADIEU

Among these, ""STARE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- T is the 2nd most common consonant
- A and E are the most common vowels
- R is also very common
This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters without repetition.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" but ""STARE"" is slightly more balanced with the vowel placement.

- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. We must have T and E somewhere in the remaining four positions, but not in their original spots (2 and 5 respectively).
3. We cannot use A or R.
4. We need two more unique letters (since we already have S, T, E).

Good candidates for the remaining letters (excluding A, R) are common English letters like L, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Let's try to place T and E in new positions:
Possible positions for T: 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let's try placing E in position 2 (since it can't be 5) and T in position 3 or 4.

Word structure: S E T _ _  or  S _ T E _

Let's try S E T _ _ first. We need two more letters. Good consonants could be L and I, making S E T L I. But this is ""SETLI"" which seems unlikely.

Another approach: Let's try S _ _ E _. For the 2nd and 3rd positions, we can use common letters like L, N, I. Let's try S L I E T - but T is in position 5 which was forbidden for E but not for T.

Wait, E can't be in position 5, but T can be in position 5. So S L I E T is possible, but that's SLIET which isn't a word.

Let's think of actual words:
- S P I T E (E is in position 4, T in 3) - but we have T(-) which means T is somewhere but not in 2. Here T is in 3 which is allowed. Also P and I are new letters.
- S P I T E seems valid.

Another option: S W E E T - but E repeats which wastes a guess.
- S H I E T - not a word.
- S T E E L - E repeats.

Let's try S P I T E:
- S is correct in position 1.
- P is new.
- I is new.
- T is in position 3 (allowed since T(-) just says not in position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed since E(-) said not in position 5).

This seems like a good balanced guess.

Alternative: S W E E T - but double E is inefficient.
Alternative: S T I E R - but R is excluded.
Alternative: S L I T E - but L is new, I is new, T in 3, E in 5 (but E can't be in 5), so this fails.

Thus, S P I T E seems the best current option.

Guess 2: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. S is locked in 1st position.
2. T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
3. E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.
4. Letters that have been ruled out so far:  
   A, R, P, I (all marked x in one of the guesses).

So far we have:

S _ _ _ _

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- T (cannot be in position 2)
- E (cannot be in position 5)

We also need two more unique consonants/vowels that have not been tried and are not A, R, P, I.

Good remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s generate possible patterns:

Pattern choices:
- S _ _ T _   (T in 4, E must go in 2 or 3)
- S _ _ _ T   (T in 5, E must go in 2,3, or 4)
- S _ T _ _   (T in 3, E must go in 2 or 4)
- S T _ _ _   (T in 2) — but T(-) says T is not in position 2 — so this is disallowed.

Let’s try to place T in 3 and E in 4: S _ T E _.  
We need one more letter for position 2. From unused letters (not A,R,P,I), good ones are L, N, C, H, etc.

Word shape: S _ T E _

Possible word: S N T E ? — but needs to be a real 5-letter word. “SNTE_” is not valid.

Alternative placement: T in 4 and E in 2: S E _ T _.  
Possible word: S E C T _ — but “SECT_” needs one more letter. “SECTS” but that repeats S. “SECTO” not a word.

Another placement: T in 3 and E in 2: S E T _ _.  
Need two letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding A,R,P,I.  
“SETON” — a real word, uses N and O (both unused).
- S ✓
- E ✓
- T ✓ (position 3, allowed since T(-) only forbids position 2)
- O and N are new letters.

Let’s check if “SETON” obeys all constraints:
- S fixed in 1st.
- T in 3rd (allowed).
- E in 2nd (allowed).
- No A, R, P, I.
- All letters unique.

This seems good.

Guess 3: SETON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(-) T(-) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate all information received so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. T is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
3. E is in the word somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SPITE and SETON feedback).
4. Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: A, R, P, I, O, N.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

Possible positions for T:
- Allowed positions: 4 or 5 (because positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for T).

Possible positions for E:
- Allowed positions: 3 or 5 (because positions 2 and 4 are ruled out for E).

Now we have two main cases to consider:

Case 1: T in 4 and E in 5
   Word structure: S _ _ T E
   But E is allowed in 5 (only position 5 was never ruled out for E)
   However, the word would be S _ _ T E. We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding A, R, P, I, O, N.

Case 2: T in 5 and E in 3
   Word structure: S _ E _ T
   This seems promising.

Let's explore Case 2 (S _ E _ T) first because it feels more likely to yield common words.

We need:
- Position 2: any letter except A, R, P, I, O, N
- Position 4: any letter except A, R, P, I, O, N, S, E, T

Common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

Let's try to form real words with S _ E _ T:

- S L E U T → not a word
- S C E L T → not a word
- S H E L T → close to ""SHELT"" but no
- S W E L T → no
- S M E L T → ""SMELT"" is a real word (past tense of smell or a type of fish)

Let's check ""SMELT"":
- S ✓ (position 1 correct)
- M (new)
- E (position 3 - allowed)
- L (new)
- T (position 5 - allowed)

No forbidden letters, no repeats, valid word.

Another check for Case 1 (S _ _ T E):
Possible word: S L U T E → ""SLUTE"" not a word
S C U T E → ""SCUTE"" is a biological term but less common
S H U T E → not standard

Thus, ""SMELT"" seems the best next guess.

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. T is fixed in position 5.
3. E is fixed in position 3.
4. Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, P, I, O, N, M, L.

So the word structure is: S _ E _ T

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding the eliminated ones).

Remaining available letters (unused and not eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y

We need real 5-letter English words of the form S ? E ? T.

Let me list possible combinations:

- S B E C T → no
- S C E B T → no
- S D E C T → no
- S C E D T → no
- S G E T T → no (T repeats)
- S H E E T → no (E repeats)
- S C E N T → but N is eliminated
- S W E E T → no (E repeats)
- S W E P T → P is eliminated
- S V E S T → no (S repeats)
- S C E N T → N is eliminated
- S C E P T → P eliminated
- S C E S T → S repeats
- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S C E L T → L eliminated
- S C E R T → R eliminated

Looking carefully at common words:

- S C E N T → N is eliminated
- S W E E T → E repeats, invalid
- S C E P T → P eliminated
- S C E S T → S repeats
- S C E R T → R eliminated
- S C E D T → not a word
- S C E B T → not a word
- S V E S T → S repeats
- S C E N T → N eliminated

Wait, let me think of more systematically:

Actually, let's list all valid English words of the form S * E * T:

- SWEET (invalid, E repeats)
- SLEET (L eliminated)
- SWEAT (A eliminated)
- SWEPT (P eliminated)
- SWELT (invalid word)
- SKEET
- SKEET is a valid word (a type of shooting sport)

Let's check SKEET:
- S (position 1) ✓
- K (new)
- E (position 3) ✓
- E (position 4) - but we already have E in position 3, so this would be E in position 4 which is allowed but we have E already. However, letters can repeat in words even if they're marked in feedback - the feedback only tells us about that specific position. So E in position 4 is fine as long as we don't have feedback against it.

Wait, but in our constraints, E is confirmed in position 3 and there's no restriction on other Es. However, in the word SKEET, E would appear twice. Is this allowed? Yes, unless previous feedback explicitly ruled out additional Es, which it didn't.

But let's check if there's a word with distinct letters:

- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S C E D T → not a word
- S C E B T → not a word
- S C E G T → not a word

Actually, SCEAT is not a word. Let me think again.

Looking back at valid S _ E _ T words:

- S C E N T → N eliminated
- S K E E T → valid (skeet)
- S W E E T → invalid
- S C E S T → invalid
- S C E R T → R eliminated

SKEET seems to be the only valid option with current constraints. Also, K and the second E are new letters not previously eliminated.

Therefore, SKEET is the logical next guess.Based on the feedback, the confirmed letters are:
- S at position 1 ✓
- E at position 3 ✓
- T at position 5 ✓

The word structure is: S _ E _ T

From the remaining valid letters (excluding A, R, P, I, O, N, M, L), the only common English word fitting this pattern is SKEET.
