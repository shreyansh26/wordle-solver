For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes letters like A, E, I, O, U, S, T, R, N, L, etc. Some popular first guesses are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters including two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good feedback on these frequently used letters.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position: S _ _ _ _
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Now we need a new guess that keeps S in the first spot and avoids L, A, T, E. We want to introduce new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A common strategy is to test another set of consonants and vowels to gather more information. Trying to include the vowel I or O is helpful since we haven’t tested those yet, and popular consonants like N, R, C, or H are also good candidates.

One strong candidate is “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid 5-letter word.
Another candidate is “SPURN” – but that uses U and N, which could be useful.
A simpler candidate is “SPURN” or “SPOOK” but ""SPOOK"" repeats O and K, which might not be ideal.

Let’s go with “SHORN” – uses S (fixed first), H, O, R, N – all new letters and a valid word.

But “SHORN” has H, O, R, N – none of which are ruled out yet. This seems like a good next guess to test more letters.

However, let me double-check: “SHORN” is a valid word (past participle of shear). It uses:
S (known correct first letter)
H – new
O – new
R – new
N – new

This seems optimal.

Current deductions:

1. S is fixed in position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from SOUND feedback: N(-)).
3. O is in the word but neither in position 2 (from SOUND) nor position 3 (from SHORN). So O must be in position 4: S _ _ O _
4. Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, H, R, U, D.

Therefore the pattern is: S _ _ O _ with N somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible pattern candidates:
- S N _ O _
- S _ N O _

Remaining unused consonants: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U, O used, U excluded)

Try S N _ O _:
Need a letter for position 3 from allowed set, and position 5 from allowed set.

Possible words:
- SN I O _ → but position 5 needs a consonant from remaining list (B, C, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z). 
- SN I O B → ""SNIOB"" – invalid
- SN I O K → ""SNIOK"" – invalid
- SN I O P → ""SNIOP"" – invalid

None of these are valid English words.

Also none of these are valid.

Alternative: Maybe I missed some letters. Let's list unused valid letters: B, C, F, G, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words fitting S _ _ O _ or S _ _ O N (but N is already constrained).

Wait, perhaps the pattern is S _ _ O N is invalid because N must be in position 2 or 3. So S _ N O _ is the only possible with N in position 3.

Looking up valid five-letter words:
- S K I O N → ""SKION"" – invalid
- S K I O N – not found
- S P I O N – ""SPION"" (valid, means spy)
- S W I O N – invalid
- S C I O N – ""SCION"" (valid)

Between SPION and SCION:
- SPION: tests P, I
- SCION: tests C, I

Both are valid, both fit the pattern S _ I O N.

SCION seems more common, so let's go with that.
