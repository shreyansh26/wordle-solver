For the first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This word can potentially give us feedback on 5 different letters and their positions, which would be very helpful for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C and R are in the word but in the wrong positions (they appear somewhere, just not in slots 1 and 2).
- A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, N, or E.

Now I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps C and R in different slots.
2. Avoids A, N, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- TROCK – uses T, O, C, K, R. Reuses C and R in new positions, introduces T, O, K.
- TRUCK – uses T, R, U, C, K. Has U (another vowel) and K.
- CROFT – uses C, R, O, F, T. Has O and F.

I’ll choose TRUCK because:
- It places R in position 1 (allowed since R was only excluded from position 2).
- It places C in position 3 (allowed since C was excluded from position 1).
- It introduces U and K, which are both fairly common, and T.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions:
- C was in positions 1 and 4 (wrong both times) → C must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- R was in positions 2 and 2 (wrong both times) → R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but NOT 2).
- K was in position 5 → K is in the word but not at position 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, N, E, T, U.

So far we have the letters C, R, K definitely in the secret word (and none of A, N, E, T, U).

Common remaining letters we can test: S, L, O, I, M, H, D, G, B, F, Y, W.

I want a word that:
- Contains C, R, K.
- Places C somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places K somewhere other than position 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- CRICK – but this repeats C and R in positions 1/2 which we know are wrong, and uses I (allowed).
- ROCKS – uses O (allowed), keeps R, O, C, K, S.
- CLOCK – uses L (allowed).
- CROCK – has two C’s (allowed), but C in position 1 is wrong.
- ROCKY – Y is allowed.

I’ll go with CROCK. It places:
- C in position 1 (we know is wrong) – but it also contains another C, so we might still get a hit for the second C in a valid spot.
- R in position 2 (we know is wrong) – but it lets us test the other letters.

Wait, both C in position 1 and R in position 2 are definitely wrong, so CROCK would give poor positional info.

Better choice: ROCKY
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is a common remaining vowel.
- C is in position 3 (allowed).
- K is in position 4 (allowed).
- Y is a consonant we haven’t tested.

Word: ROCKY
Positions:
- R (allowed at 1)
- O (new vowel)
- C (allowed at 3)
- K (allowed at 4)
- Y (new letter)

This should give good positional info on C and K, and test O and Y.
