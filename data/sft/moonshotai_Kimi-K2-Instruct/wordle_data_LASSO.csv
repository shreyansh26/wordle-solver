For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving broad coverage. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
- 4th letter is S.
- A and O are somewhere in the word (not positions 1 or 3 respectively).
- R and E are not in the word.

Possible positions for A and O:
- A cannot be first, so it could be 2,3,4,5. But 4 is S, so 2,3,5.
- O cannot be third, so it could be 1,2,4,5. But 4 is S, so 1,2,5.

We need a 5-letter word where:
- 4th letter is S
- Contains A and O (in positions not excluded by feedback)
- Does not contain R or E

Let me think of words fitting this. ""ADIOS"" comes to mind:
- A is 1st position (but feedback says A is not 1st - so no)
""OASIS"":
- O is 1st (allowed)
- A is 2nd (allowed)
- S is 4th (matches)
- Does not have R or E
- Has I which we don't have info about yet, but that's okay for second guess

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is fixed in slot 4.
   - A is in the word but not in slot 1.
   - O is in the word but not in slot 3.
   - R and E are completely absent.

2. OASIS → O(-) A(✓) S(✓) I(x) S(-)
   - S is still in slot 4 and reconfirmed ✓.
   - A is now known to be in slot 2.
   - O is in the word but not in slot 1 (and already knew not in slot 3).
   - I is totally absent.
   - The last S is -, so there is no second S in slot 5.

So the pattern is now:
  [ _  A  _  S  _ ]

Letters still required:
- O must appear somewhere (not slots 1 or 3).
- No R, E, I.
- Common consonants we have not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, Y, etc.

Where can O go?
- Slot 3 is forbidden, slot 1 is forbidden, and slot 2 is A, slot 4 is S, so the only legal position for O is slot 5.

So the word must be:
  [ _  A  _  S  O ]

Now we just need a consonant for slot 1 and slot 3.  
Popular consonants we haven’t ruled out: L, N, T, C, B, D, etc.

Consider slot 3. A consonant there forms a common cluster with S (e.g., “-PSO” or “-NSO”), but we need real words.

Possible candidates:
- CANSO (a place name) – slot 3 N, slot 1 C.
- BANSO – doesn’t appear in standard word lists.
- MANSO – same.
- TANSO – same.
- PANSO – same.
- CAMSO – not valid.
- CAPSO – not standard.

Let me think of standard dictionary words that fit “_ A _ S O”.

“CANSO” is recognized in some dictionaries (a river in Canada).  
However, if we want a more universally accepted word, we can look for others.

Another pattern: “M A _ S O” – but that gives “MAPSO,” invalid.

Try “T A _ S O” – “TAPSO,” “TALSO,” invalid.

Try L in slot 3: “L A _ S O” – “LASSO” – a valid word.  
Does LASSO fit all constraints?
- A is in slot 2 ✓
- S is in slot 4 ✓
- O is in slot 5 ✓
- Contains no R, I, E ✓
- No second S elsewhere ✓

Looks perfect.

So the next logical guess is “LASSO”.
