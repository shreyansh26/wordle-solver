### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The optimal strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - good consonants and vowels)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O - many vowels)
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - common letters)

I'll choose **CRANE** as it contains some of the most common letters in English words (C, R, A, N, E) and gives a good balance of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters (C, R, A, N, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge set of possibilities.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Y

- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Contains at least one vowel (I or U).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The optimal strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - good consonants and vowels)

- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - common letters)

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Y

A balanced, high-information choice is “SLOTH” (S, L, O, T, H).

Summary of what we know so far:

- Letters permanently ruled out:
  C, R, A, N, E, S, O, T, H, F, I, D, P, M, B  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word (positions unknown):
  L and U (each must appear at least once)

Remaining alphabet (besides L and U):
Consonants left: G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid 5-letter word must therefore contain both L and U and three additional consonants chosen only from the remaining set above.

Let’s look at possible words fitting that pattern:

- GULKY (G, U, L, K, Y) – all letters still allowed
- JUMPY – M and P already ruled out
- VULKY – V, U, L, K, Y – allowed
- QULKY – Q, U, L, K, Y – allowed
- YULKY – Y, U, L, K – but that’s 4 letters, doesn’t fit
- GULKY is 5 letters, and all letters are valid

GULKY seems like a good next guess because it places U in the second position and L in the third, testing new positions for both, and uses two fresh remaining consonants (G, K, Y).

Let’s check:
- G, U, L, K, Y – none of these are in the ruled-out list.
- It’s a valid English word (rare but listed as slang).

So let’s go with GULKY.

From the latest feedback (GULKY → G✓ U✓ L✓ Kx Y✓) we now have:

- Letters confirmed and in the correct positions:
  – G is in position 1  
  – U is in position 2  
  – L is in position 3  
  – Y is in position 5  

- K is not in the word (Kx).

So the pattern so far is:
G U L _ Y

We need a single letter for the 4th position, chosen from the still-legal consonants.  
Up to now, the letters already ruled out are:
C, R, A, N, E, S, O, T, H, F, I, D, P, M, B, K

That leaves these consonants for slot 4:  
J, Q, V, W, X, Z

The only common 5-letter words that fit the pattern GUL_ Y and use one of those consonants are:

- GULFY – F is already out  
- GULPY – P is out  
- GULLY – L is already in position 3 and must appear once (double-L is possible, but let’s check others)  
- GULVY – V is allowed  
- GULJY – J is allowed  
- GULQY – Q is allowed  
- GULWY – W is allowed  
- GULXY – X is allowed  
- GULZY – Z is allowed  

Among these, “GULVY” is the only one listed in most standard English dictionaries (though rare).  
However, “GULLY” is extremely common and satisfies the single-L requirement because L can appear twice (the feedback only tells us at least one L is present; it doesn’t forbid a second).

Given rarity, “GULLY” is the safest, most likely intended word.

Therefore, the final guess is:
