For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid 5-letter word
- It covers 5 of the 10 most frequent letters in English

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, S, E are NOT in the word (✗).
- R and O ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we have:
- Letters to keep: R, O
- Known positions NOT to place them in:
  – R cannot be in position 2
  – O cannot be in position 3
- Letters to avoid: A, S, E
- We still need to test remaining frequent consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, U).

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R and O in different positions from the rejected ones.
2. Introduces new high-frequency letters not yet tested (T, N, I, U, L, etc.).
3. Doesn’t use A, S, or E.

A good candidate is “FRUIT”:
- Contains R (moves to position 1) and O is not used (we can test other vowels).
- Actually let me pick “FRONT” instead so I can test T and N while still placing R in position 1 and O in position 3 (but O was in position 3 last time and marked “-”, so position 3 is wrong for O).

Let me choose “TRION”:
- R in position 2 (was position 2 last time, so invalid).
Better: “NORTH”  
- R in position 3 (OK, since R was in position 2 and wrong)
- O in position 1 (OK, since O was in position 3 and wrong)
- Uses N, T, H (new letters)

“NORTH” satisfies:
- R in 3rd, O in 1st
- Adds N, T, H (all new)
- Avoids A, S, E

Let's digest the new feedback:

1. From AROSE:
   - A, S, E are NOT in the word.
   - R and O are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. From NORTH:
   - N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
   - O(✓) → O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
   - R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
   - T(-) → T is in the word but in the wrong position (was in position 4).
   - H(✓) → H is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Correct letters and positions: _ O R _ H
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is already R, so T must be in position 1).
- The word form is T O R _ H.
- The missing letter must be a consonant that hasn't been tested yet, and it must be in position 4.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit T O R _ H:
- TORCH (common word, C hasn't been tested yet)
- TORAH (but A was already ruled out)
- TORCH seems the only valid word left to guess.
