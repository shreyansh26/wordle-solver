For the first guess, since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain common vowels and consonants.

A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This gives good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words. If these letters are in the word, I'll get good information about their positions. If they're not, I can eliminate many words containing these letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is correct in first position.
- E is correct in fifth position.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

So the word is of the form: S _ _ _ E, and it does NOT contain L, A, or T.

I want a second guess that:
1. Respects the fixed S and E,
2. Avoids L, A, T,
3. Uses new common letters to test the middle positions.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y  
Good vowels to test: I, O, U

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,siege,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain common vowels and consonants.

A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This gives good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words. If these letters are in the word, I'll get good information about their positions. If they're not, I can eliminate many words containing these letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is correct in first position.
- E is correct in fifth position.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

So the word is of the form: S _ _ _ E, and it does NOT contain L, A, or T.

I want a second guess that:
1. Respects the fixed S and E,
2. Avoids L, A, T,
3. Uses new common letters to test the middle positions.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y  
Good vowels to test: I, O, U

A strong candidate is “SHINE”:
- Starts with S, ends with E ✓
- Avoids L, A, T ✓
- Tests H, I, N in the middle positions—common letters that haven’t been checked yet.

- Pattern: S _ _ _ E (S and E fixed in positions 1 and 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, H, N.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So we need:
- S _ _ _ E
- The word contains I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3).
- No L, A, T, H, N.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, U (I already confirmed)
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y

Since I must appear, and it can’t be in position 3, let’s test it in position 2 or 4.

Candidate patterns:
- S I _ _ E  (I in position 2)
- S _ I _ E  (I in position 3) — but feedback says I is in wrong position, so it can’t be position 3
- S _ _ I E  (I in position 4)

So possible patterns:
- S I _ _ E
- S _ _ I E

Let’s try S P I R E:
- S and E correct positions ✓
- Contains I ✓
- Uses P, R which are common and haven’t been tested
- Avoids all excluded letters

Alternatively, S W I R E, S P I K E, S V I D E etc. but SPIRE seems most common.

   - E is NOT in position 4 (it got “-”); but we already know E is fixed in position 5, so this doesn’t give new info.
   - The final S in SIMES got “-”, which confirms S is only in position 1.

So we need:
- S I _ _ E

- Still no S elsewhere (only at start)
- I is locked in position 2
- We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining pool.

- S I D D E  → SIDDE (invalid)
- S I B E   → needs 5 letters, so S I B _ E  → SIB_E

- S I F E — too short
- S I D E — too short
- S I C E — too short
- S I V E — too short
Wait, we need a 5-letter word starting SI, ending E, with no banned letters.

Let’s check a mental list of 5-letter words starting with SI and ending with E:

- SIEVE  — that’s 5 letters: S I E V E. Let’s check letters:
   - S I E V E → has I in 2nd (✓), S in 1st (✓), E in 5th (✓)
   - Letters used: S, I, E, V — none are on the banned list (L,A,T,H,N,P,R,M)
   - V is new, so we’ll test it.

Valid word, fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess SIEVE.",Guess 5: SIEVE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,siege,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often contain common vowels and consonants.

A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This gives good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words. If these letters are in the word, I'll get good information about their positions. If they're not, I can eliminate many words containing these letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is correct in first position.
- E is correct in fifth position.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

So the word is of the form: S _ _ _ E, and it does NOT contain L, A, or T.

I want a second guess that:
1. Respects the fixed S and E,
2. Avoids L, A, T,
3. Uses new common letters to test the middle positions.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y  
Good vowels to test: I, O, U

A strong candidate is “SHINE”:
- Starts with S, ends with E ✓
- Avoids L, A, T ✓
- Tests H, I, N in the middle positions—common letters that haven’t been checked yet.

Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E (S and E fixed in positions 1 and 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, H, N.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So we need:
- S _ _ _ E
- The word contains I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3).
- No L, A, T, H, N.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, U (I already confirmed)
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y

Since I must appear, and it can’t be in position 3, let’s test it in position 2 or 4.

Candidate patterns:
- S I _ _ E  (I in position 2)
- S _ I _ E  (I in position 3) — but feedback says I is in wrong position, so it can’t be position 3
- S _ _ I E  (I in position 4)

So possible patterns:
- S I _ _ E
- S _ _ I E

Let’s try S P I R E:
- S and E correct positions ✓
- Contains I ✓
- Uses P, R which are common and haven’t been tested
- Avoids all excluded letters

Alternatively, S W I R E, S P I K E, S V I D E etc. but SPIRE seems most common.

Let’s go with:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E (S and E fixed in 1st and 5th positions).
- Letters NOT in word: L, A, T, H, N, P, R.
- Letter I is present but is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in both SPIRE and SHINE it got “-” feedback).
- Therefore I must be in position 2 → the word is S I _ _ E.

Allowed letters so far (excluding the banned ones):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: O, U (I already used, A forbidden)

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.

Popular combinations:
- S I D E → SIDE (but SIDE is only 4 letters; we need 5)
- S I C K E → SICKE (not a valid word)
- S I V E (needs another letter)
- S I K E → SIKE?  (but that’s 4 letters)
- S I C E (4 letters)

Valid 5-letter words fitting S I _ _ E with remaining consonants:
- S I Z E D (6 letters)
- S I C K E (invalid)
- S I V E R (invalid, R banned)
- S I D E D (invalid)
- S I C K Y (ends Y, but needs E)
- S I D L E (invalid, L banned)
- S I D E S (plural, ends S)
- S I C K S (invalid)
- S I K E S → SIKES (valid 5-letter word)

Let me check SIKES:
- S I K E S → but last letter must be E, not S. So invalid.

Valid remaining option: S I V E S → ends S, invalid.

Another: S I D G E → SIDGE? Not a word.

Another: S I G H E → SIGHE? Not a word.

Another: S I K E Y → SIKEY? Not a word.

Another: S I C C E → SICCE? Not a word.

Another: S I G G E → SIGGE? Not a word.

Another: S I M M E → SIMME? Not a word.

Another: S I M P E → SIMPE? Not a word.

Another: S I M E K → SIMEK? Not a word.

Another: S I M E S → SIMES. This is a valid word (SIMES is plural of sime, a dialectal term). Let me check if it avoids banned letters:
- Letters in SIMES: S, I, M, E, S.
- Banned letters: L, A, T, H, N, P, R. None of these appear.
- Pattern: S I M _ E → fits S I _ _ E.
- Also, M and S have not been tested yet.

So SIMES is a valid guess.

Let me pick SIMES as the next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update the known constraints with the new feedback:

1. Pattern now: S I _ _ E  (because I finally landed in position 2 with a ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word (so far): L, A, T, H, N, P, R, M.
3. From SIMES we learned:
   - M is NOT in the word (x).  
   - E is NOT in position 4 (it got “-”); but we already know E is fixed in position 5, so this doesn’t give new info.
   - The final S in SIMES got “-”, which confirms S is only in position 1.

So we need:
- S I _ _ E
- No L, A, T, H, N, P, R, M
- Still no S elsewhere (only at start)
- I is locked in position 2
- We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining pool.

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, V, W, Y, Z, plus any others we haven’t banned.

We want a common English word of the form SI _ _ E.

Let’s list possibilities that fit:
- S I C K E  → no, K in 4th, but ends E, so SICKE (invalid)
- S I D G E  → SIDGE (not a valid word)
- S I D D E  → SIDDE (invalid)
- S I B E   → needs 5 letters, so S I B _ E  → SIB_E
- S I C E — too short
- S I K E — too short
- S I V E — too short
- S I F E — too short
- S I D E — too short
- S I C E — too short
- S I V E — too short
Wait, we need a 5-letter word starting SI, ending E, with no banned letters.

Let’s check a mental list of 5-letter words starting with SI and ending with E:

- SIEVE  — that’s 5 letters: S I E V E. Let’s check letters:

   - Letters used: S, I, E, V — none are on the banned list (L,A,T,H,N,P,R,M)
   - V is new, so we’ll test it.
