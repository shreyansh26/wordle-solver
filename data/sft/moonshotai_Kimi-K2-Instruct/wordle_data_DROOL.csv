For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage of common letters in the alphabet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage of common letters in the alphabet.

- The word has the pattern _ R O _ _
- It does not contain A, S, or E.
- It may contain any of the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) in positions 1, 4, or 5.

I want a word that:
- Starts with a consonant (since vowels A and E are out).
- Uses new common consonants to maximize info.
- Has no A, S, or E.

So far we have this picture:

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still need to pin down:  
D (because the feedback on “PROUD” showed D(-) – it is present but not in position 5)

Therefore D must occupy either position 1 or position 4.

Remaining valid alphabet letters (not yet ruled out and not already known to be in the word):  
B, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a new word that:
- keeps R in slot 2 and O in slot 3
- contains D in either slot 1 or slot 4
- avoids all the excluded letters listed above

Two quick possibilities jump out:

1. D R O I L  – D in position 1, tests I and L in positions 4-5.
2. B R O I D  – D in position 5, but we already know D can’t be there, so this is invalid.

Another valid idea:  
B R O D Y – D in position 4, tests B and Y.

Of these, “BRODY” is perfectly consistent with every clue so far and uses two fresh consonants (B, Y) plus the known D in the feasible position 4.

Let’s lock that in.

Current facts:
- Pattern locked: _ R O _ _
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, S, E, F, T, C, W, N, P, U, B, Y
- Letter confirmed IN the word but not yet placed: D (must be in position 1 or 4)

Therefore we need a word that:
1. Keeps R in slot 2 and O in slot 3
2. Contains D in either position 1 or position 4
3. Uses only letters not yet excluded

Remaining possible letters: D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Z

Try D in position 1: D R O _ _
- Need two more letters from remaining set
- Common viable options: DRILL (but I and L are still possible)
- Check if D R O I L is valid: D is allowed in position 1, I and L not yet excluded

Alternatively try D in position 4: _ R O D _
- Need a valid letter for position 1 and 5
- Possible candidates: G R O D Y (but Y is excluded)
- H R O D X (X is allowed but unlikely)
- G R O D Z (Z is allowed but unlikely)

Best bet is DRILL as it uses common letters I and L that haven't been ruled out.
