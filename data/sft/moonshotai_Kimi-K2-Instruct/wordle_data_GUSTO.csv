For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage of the alphabet on the first guess to help narrow down possibilities.

Alternative good starting words might be ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SLATE"", but I think ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3)
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is somewhere other than position 4)
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all

Summary of constraints:
- Letters definitely not present: A, R, E
- Letters definitely present (somewhere): O, S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4

Since we know O and S are in the word, and we need a new word that tests other common consonants and vowels to narrow down the remaining letters, a good next guess would place O and S in new spots while introducing new letters.

A word like ""SOUND"" would place S in position 1 (new position) and O in position 2 (new position) while testing new letters U, N, D. However, ""CLOUD"" is also a good option. I think ""CLOUD"" is slightly better because it tests C, L, U, D around the known O.

But let's consider ""STOCK"" – this places S in position 1 (new), O in position 2 (new), and tests C, T, K. However, we already saw S can't be in position 4 (from AROSE), but position 1 is fine.

Actually, ""CLOUD"" seems more balanced: C, L, U, D are all new letters, O is in position 2 (new), and we haven't placed S yet in this word, but we know S must appear somewhere.

Wait, we must include S since we know it's in the word. Let me pick ""CLOUD"" but adjust to include S. A better choice is ""CLOPS"" – but P isn't great. ""STOCK"" includes S and O in new positions. Let me go with ""STOCK"".

But ""STOCK"" repeats no letters from AROSE except S and O, which is good. It places S in 1 (new), T is new, O in 2 (new), C is new, K is new. This seems optimal.

However, ""STOCK"" might not use the most common remaining letters. A better word might be ""SONIC"" – S in 1, O in 2, N, I, C are new. But I think ""STOCK"" is simpler.

Actually, ""SNOWY"" – but Y is less common. Let me stick with ""STOCK"" as it covers new consonants and positions S and O well.

Wait, we must include S since we know it's in the word. Let me pick ""CLOUD"" but adjust to include S. A better choice is ""CLOPS"" – but P isn't great. ""STOCK"" includes S and O in new positions. Let me go with ""STOCK"".

But ""STOCK"" repeats no letters from AROSE except S and O, which is good. It places S in 1 (new), T is new, O in 2 (new), C is new, K is new. This seems optimal.

However, ""STOCK"" might not use the most common remaining letters. A better word might be ""SONIC"" – S in 1, O in 2, N, I, C are new. But I think ""STOCK"" is simpler.

Actually, ""SNOWY"" – but Y is less common. Let me stick with ""STOCK"" as it covers new consonants and positions S and O well.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STOCK:

- O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- C(x)  → C is not in the word at all
- K(x)  → K is not in the word at all

Combined with the earlier feedback from AROSE we have:

Excluded letters so far: A, R, E, C, K  
Letters that must appear: O, S, T  
Forbidden positions:
  – S ≠ 1, 4  
  – O ≠ 2, 3  
  – T ≠ 2  

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, T and avoids the forbidden positions and excluded letters.  
Let’s list the allowed positions for each mandatory letter:

S can be: 2, 3, 5  
O can be: 1, 4, 5  
T can be: 1, 3, 4, 5  

We still need two more letters. The remaining frequent letters that have not been ruled out are: N, L, D, I, U, Y, etc.  
Let’s try to place the letters:

1. Put O in position 1 (allowed)
2. Put T in position 3 (allowed)
3. Put S in position 5 (allowed)  
That leaves positions 2 and 4 to fill with two new letters from the remaining set.  
Using N and I seems good.

Word candidate: O N T I S

Check:
- O is in position 1 ✓
- T is in position 3 ✓
- S is in position 5 ✓
- N and I haven’t been used or ruled out ✓
- All constraints satisfied.

Summary of constraints:

Since we know O and S are in the word, and we need a new word that tests other common consonants and vowels to narrow down the remaining letters, a good next guess would place O and S in new spots while introducing new letters.

A word like ""SOUND"" would place S in position 1 (new position) and O in position 2 (new position) while testing new letters U, N, D. However, ""CLOUD"" is also a good option. I think ""CLOUD"" is slightly better because it tests C, L, U, D around the known O.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters **that must appear** (but position still unknown):  
   O, S, T

2. Letters **that must NOT appear** (already ruled out):  
   A, R, E, C, K, N, I, D, L

3. Forbidden positions for the required letters:

   - S ≠ 1, 4, 5  
   - O ≠ 1, 2, 3  
   - T ≠ 2, 3, 4  

   Therefore the only **possible** positions are:

   - S must be at position 2 or 3  
   - O must be at position 4 or 5  
   - T must be at position 1 or 5  

4. We have two empty slots left to fill **only with letters that have not been tested and are not already excluded**.  
   Remaining unused common letters: M, U, Y, G, B, F, etc.

Now combine the position constraints:

- If T is placed at 1, then S must be at 2 or 3, and O must be at 4 or 5.  
- If T is placed at 5, then S must be at 2 or 3, and O must be at 4 (because 5 is taken by T).  

Let’s explore the T=5 scenario:

Positions: 1 _ 2/3 _ 3/2 _ 4 O _ 5 T

A simple valid arrangement:

1 _ 2 S _ 3 _ 4 O _ 5 T  → word so far: _ S _ O T  
We need one letter for position 1 and one for position 3.  
The remaining legal letters that have not been used are, for example, U and M.

Try: U S M O T

Check constraints:
- U and M are new (not excluded)  
- O at 4 (allowed)  
- S at 2 (allowed)  
- T at 5 (allowed)  
- All positions satisfy the constraints.

Therefore, USMOT is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage of the alphabet on the first guess to help narrow down possibilities.

Alternative good starting words might be ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SLATE"", but I think ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3)
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is somewhere other than position 4)
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all

Summary of constraints:
- Letters definitely not present: A, R, E
- Letters definitely present (somewhere): O, S
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4

Since we know O and S are in the word, and we need a new word that tests other common consonants and vowels to narrow down the remaining letters, a good next guess would place O and S in new spots while introducing new letters.

A word like ""SOUND"" would place S in position 1 (new position) and O in position 2 (new position) while testing new letters U, N, D. However, ""CLOUD"" is also a good option. I think ""CLOUD"" is slightly better because it tests C, L, U, D around the known O.

But let's consider ""STOCK"" – this places S in position 1 (new), O in position 2 (new), and tests C, T, K. However, we already saw S can't be in position 4 (from AROSE), but position 1 is fine.

Actually, ""CLOUD"" seems more balanced: C, L, U, D are all new letters, O is in position 2 (new), and we haven't placed S yet in this word, but we know S must appear somewhere.

Wait, we must include S since we know it's in the word. Let me pick ""CLOUD"" but adjust to include S. A better choice is ""CLOPS"" – but P isn't great. ""STOCK"" includes S and O in new positions. Let me go with ""STOCK"".

But ""STOCK"" repeats no letters from AROSE except S and O, which is good. It places S in 1 (new), T is new, O in 2 (new), C is new, K is new. This seems optimal.

However, ""STOCK"" might not use the most common remaining letters. A better word might be ""SONIC"" – S in 1, O in 2, N, I, C are new. But I think ""STOCK"" is simpler.

Actually, ""SNOWY"" – but Y is less common. Let me stick with ""STOCK"" as it covers new consonants and positions S and O well.

<guess>STOCK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STOCK:

- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1
- T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 2
- O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- C(x)  → C is not in the word at all
- K(x)  → K is not in the word at all

Combined with the earlier feedback from AROSE we have:

Excluded letters so far: A, R, E, C, K  
Letters that must appear: O, S, T  
Forbidden positions:
  – S ≠ 1, 4  
  – O ≠ 2, 3  
  – T ≠ 2  

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, T and avoids the forbidden positions and excluded letters.  
Let’s list the allowed positions for each mandatory letter:

S can be: 2, 3, 5  
O can be: 1, 4, 5  
T can be: 1, 3, 4, 5  

We still need two more letters. The remaining frequent letters that have not been ruled out are: N, L, D, I, U, Y, etc.  
Let’s try to place the letters:

1. Put O in position 1 (allowed)
2. Put T in position 3 (allowed)
3. Put S in position 5 (allowed)  
That leaves positions 2 and 4 to fill with two new letters from the remaining set.  
Using N and I seems good.

Word candidate: O N T I S

Check:
- O is in position 1 ✓
- T is in position 3 ✓
- S is in position 5 ✓
- N and I haven’t been used or ruled out ✓
- All constraints satisfied.

Let’s guess ONTIS.

<guess>ONTIS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: ONTIS -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(x) T(-) I(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ONTIS:

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 1  
- N(x) → N is not in the word at all  
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
- I(x) → I is not in the word at all  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
Letters that must appear: O, S, T  
Letters that cannot appear: A, R, E, C, K, N, I  
Forbidden positions:
  – S ≠ 1, 4, 5  
  – O ≠ 1, 2, 3  
  – T ≠ 2, 3  

Allowed positions:
- S can be: 2 or 3 (but 3 is now restricted because T must also fit; let’s list all positions)
- O can be: 4 or 5
- T can be: 1, 4, 5 (but O might take 4 or 5)

Let’s try to place them without conflict.

Constraints:
- S must be in {2, 3} (from above)
- O must be in {4, 5}
- T must be in {1, 4, 5}

We need two more letters that haven’t been used or ruled out. Available letters (common ones not yet tried): D, L, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: T (allowed for T)
- Position 2: S (only remaining spot for S)
- Position 3: (new letter, let’s pick D)
- Position 4: O (allowed for O)
- Position 5: (new letter, let’s pick L)

Word: T S D O L

Check constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- S in 2 (allowed)
- O in 4 (allowed)
- All letters unused so far  
- No conflicts.

So the guess is TSDOL.

   - O must be at position 4 or 5  
   - T must be at position 1 or 5  

4. We have two empty slots left to fill **only with letters that have not been tested and are not already excluded**.  
   Remaining unused common letters: M, U, Y, G, B, F, etc.

Now combine the position constraints:

- If T is placed at 1, then S must be at 2 or 3, and O must be at 4 or 5.  
- If T is placed at 5, then S must be at 2 or 3, and O must be at 4 (because 5 is taken by T).  

Let’s explore the T=5 scenario:

Positions: 1 _ 2/3 _ 3/2 _ 4 O _ 5 T

A simple valid arrangement:

1 _ 2 S _ 3 _ 4 O _ 5 T  → word so far: _ S _ O T

Try: U S M O T

Check constraints:
- U and M are new (not excluded)  
- O at 4 (allowed)

- T at 5 (allowed)  
- All positions satisfy the constraints.

Summarizing everything we now know after five guesses:

1. Letters that **must** appear in the word (because they keep coming back as “in word but wrong place”):  
   O, S, T

2. Letters that **must not** appear at all:  
   A, R, E, C, K, N, I, D, L, M, U

3. Position constraints deduced from every guess:

   - S has so far been in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 and always marked wrong-place ⇒ the only position **left** for S is **3**.
   - T has so far been in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and always marked wrong-place ⇒ **no valid position remains for T** (contradiction).  
     But that can’t be; we must have made an arithmetic error.

Let’s re-list the forbidden positions carefully:

   Guess 2 (STOCK): T was in position 2 ⇒ T ≠ 2  
   Guess 3 (ONTIS): T was in position 3 ⇒ T ≠ 3  
   Guess 4 (TSDOL): T was in position 1 ⇒ T ≠ 1  
   Guess 5 (USMOT): T was in position 5 ⇒ T ≠ 5  
   Therefore T **must** be in position **4**.  

   Similarly for S:

   Guess 1 (AROSE): S was in position 4 ⇒ S ≠ 4  
   Guess 2 (STOCK): S was in position 1 ⇒ S ≠ 1  
   Guess 3 (ONTIS): S was in position 5 ⇒ S ≠ 5  
   Guess 4 (TSDOL): S was in position 2 ⇒ S ≠ 2  
   Therefore S **must** be in position **3**.

   For O:

   Guess 1 (AROSE): O was in position 3 ⇒ O ≠ 3  
   Guess 2 (STOCK): O was in position 3 ⇒ O ≠ 3 (redundant)  
   Guess 3 (ONTIS): O was in position 1 ⇒ O ≠ 1  
   Guess 4 (TSDOL): O was in position 4 ⇒ O ≠ 4  
   Guess 5 (USMOT): O was in position 4 ⇒ O ≠ 4 (redundant)  
   Therefore O **must** be in position **2** or **5**.  
   But positions 3 and 4 are already taken by S and T respectively, leaving positions 1 and 2 and 5 open for the remaining letters.

Mapping the word with fixed letters:

   Positions: 1 _ 2 _ 3 S _ 4 T _ 5 _

And O must be in 2 or 5.  
Let’s explore both possibilities.

Case 1: O in position 2  
Word skeleton: _ O S T _  
Positions 1 and 5 need two new letters, chosen from legal remaining letters (not yet used and not in exclusion list).  
Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, common ones are B, F, G, P, W, Y.

Try Y O S T B → YOSTB — but Y, B are common.

Case 2: O in position 5  
Word skeleton: _ _ S T O  
Positions 1 and 2 need letters.  
Again choosing common legal letters: B, F, G, P, W, Y.  
Try B Y S T O → BYSTO — but Y is still allowed.

Both YOSTB and BYSTO are valid under all constraints, but we only have one guess left. Let’s pick the more common pattern. BYSTO is a known word.

Therefore, the next (and last allowed) guess is BYSTO.
