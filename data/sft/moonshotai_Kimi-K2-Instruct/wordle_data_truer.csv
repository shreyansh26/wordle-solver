1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Common letter combinations that appear in many English words
This gives us a broad base of feedback that can help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

2. The word contains an E, but E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback) and NOT in position 4 (from TRIPE feedback). Therefore E must be in position 3.
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, P.
4. Remaining unknown positions are 4 and 5.

We need a word that starts with TR, has E in position 3, and uses only letters we haven’t ruled out. Good consonants to test next are N, D, L, C, K, B, etc., plus any remaining vowels (only U left among common vowels).

From the new feedback:

- T(✓) R(✓) are still locked in positions 1 and 2.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 3; earlier we had already ruled out positions 4 and 5, so E must be in position 1 … but position 1 is T.  
  This is impossible, so the only logical conclusion is that the letter E in TREND got a dash by the rules even though it cannot occupy any remaining position. That tells us E is NOT in the word after all; the “E(-)” we received earlier must have been an error in reading.  
  Relying instead on the two unambiguous facts:
  – E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from TRIPE and TREND feedback).
  – E cannot be in position 1 or 2 (T and R are already there).
  Therefore E is not in the word.  
- N(x) and D(x) are ruled out.

So far:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _  
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, I, P, E, N, D  
- Remaining common consonants: L, C, B, K, H, M, G, Y, F

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants (R, S)

- Common letter combinations that appear in many English words
