For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to get as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This combination can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not the 5th letter).
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far:
- _ R _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S.

We need a word that fits _ R _ _ _ and contains E somewhere else. Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, D, C, etc.  
Let me pick a word that keeps R in position 2 and introduces new consonants and possibly positions E.

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- R is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- E is in position 3 (new position).
- T, N, D are all new consonants.
This should give us more information about remaining letters and E's correct placement.

From the two sets of feedback we have:

Pattern so far:
- R is correct in position 2 (✓ from both guesses).
- D is correct in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2).
- E must be in the word but not in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has D in position 5.
3. Contains E in either position 1 or 4.
4. Uses only letters that haven't been eliminated: so far allowed are B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed R and D.

Let’s try to construct such a word:
- If E is in position 1: E R _ _ D
- If E is in position 4: _ R _ E D

Looking at position 4 with E seems more promising because English words often have vowels in the middle rather than starting with E (though both are possible). Also, we haven't tried many consonants yet, so we can introduce new ones.

A word that fits _ R _ E D is ""B R E E D"". Let me check:
- B is new (not ruled out).
- R is correct in position 2.
- E is in position 3 (wait, no – in ""BREED"" E is in positions 3 and 4, but we need E in position 4 specifically based on our pattern _ R _ E D). Actually ""BREED"" would be _ R E E D, which has E in 4 and 3. That might not give us new info since we know E is in the word but not where.

Another word: ""C R E E D"" – same issue, E in 3 and 4.
""F R E E D"" – same.

Better: ""F R I E D"" – this has:
- F: new
- R: correct position
- I: new
- E: position 4 (which we want to test)
- D: correct position

This seems perfect as it places E in position 4 and introduces new consonants F and I.

Alternatively, if we try E in position 1: ""E R I E D"" – but this is a valid word (archaic past tense of ""to eread""), but less common, and we'd prefer common words.

So ""FRIED"" is the best next guess.
