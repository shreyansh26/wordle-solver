For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- STARE (uses S,T,A,R,E - all very common)
- SLATE (uses S,L,A,T,E)
- CRANE (uses C,R,A,N,E)
- CRISP (uses C,R,I,S,P)
- ADIEU (uses A,D,I,E,U)

STARE is particularly good because it uses S (very common in initial position), T (common initial), A, R, and E (most common vowel). This combination should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many common letters.

I'll go with STARE as my first guess.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word must contain A, R, E, each in some position other than the one they had in STARE.
- The word cannot contain S or T at all.
- The remaining letters to fill are two more letters (positions 1 and 2) from the remaining alphabet, excluding S and T.

Good letters to try next are consonants that haven’t been tested yet and pair well with A, R, E. Common consonants not yet tested: N, L, C, M, P, D, etc.

A reasonable next word would put A, R, E in new positions and introduce new letters. Let’s try:
- A cannot be in position 3 → try position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.
- R cannot be in position 4 → try position 1,2,3,5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → try position 1,2,3,4.

One word that fits is CRANE:
- C (new letter)
- R (in position 2, new position)
- A (in position 3, but A cannot be in position 3 → invalid)
Oops, that violates the A position.

From Guess 2 (EARLY):
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
1. Letters in the word: A (position 2), R, E.
2. Letters not in the word: S, T, L, Y.
3. Positions for A: fixed at position 2.
4. Positions for R: cannot be 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But position 2 is taken by A, so R must be in 1 or 5.
5. Positions for E: cannot be 1 or 5 → possible positions: 3 or 4.

So the word has the structure:
- Position 1: R or ?
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E or ?
- Position 4: E or ?
- Position 5: R or ?

Given R must be in 1 or 5, and E must be in 3 or 4, let's explore possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 1, E in position 3
Structure: R A E _ _
Letters used so far: R, A, E
Need two more consonants from remaining letters (excluding S, T, L, Y). Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Case 2: R in position 1, E in position 4
Structure: R A _ E _
Need two more consonants.

Case 3: R in position 5, E in position 3
Structure: _ A E _ R
Need two more consonants.

Case 4: R in position 5, E in position 4
Structure: _ A _ E R
Need two more consonants.

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:
- Case 1: R A E _ _ → RAFTS (invalid, has S,T), RACER (has C, good), RAGE (too short), etc. RACER seems possible.
- Case 2: R A _ E _ → RAPED (has D, P), RAVEN (has V, N), etc. RAVEN seems good.
- Case 3: _ A E _ R → CAESR (invalid), MAEER (invalid), PAVER (has V, P), etc. PAVER seems possible.
- Case 4: _ A _ E R → CATER (invalid, has T), PAPER (has P), etc. PAPER seems possible.

Among these, RAVEN fits Case 2 and uses common letters. Let's verify:
- R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (fixed), V and N new, E in position 4 (allowed).
- No S, T, L, Y.
- All constraints satisfied.

STARE is particularly good because it uses S (very common in initial position), T (common initial), A, R, and E (most common vowel). This combination should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many common letters.

I'll go with STARE as my first guess.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word must contain A, R, E, each in some position other than the one they had in STARE.
- The word cannot contain S or T at all.
- The remaining letters to fill are two more letters (positions 1 and 2) from the remaining alphabet, excluding S and T.

Good letters to try next are consonants that haven’t been tested yet and pair well with A, R, E. Common consonants not yet tested: N, L, C, M, P, D, etc.

A reasonable next word would put A, R, E in new positions and introduce new letters. Let’s try:
- A cannot be in position 3 → try position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.
- R cannot be in position 4 → try position 1,2,3,5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → try position 1,2,3,4.

One word that fits is CRANE:
- C (new letter)
- R (in position 2, new position)
- A (in position 3, but A cannot be in position 3 → invalid)
Oops, that violates the A position.

Next try: PEARL
- P (new)
- E (in position 2, new position)
- A (in position 3 → invalid)
Still invalid.

Try: EARLY
- E (position 1, new)
- A (position 2, new)
- R (position 3, new)
- L (new)
- Y (new)
This uses A in position 2 (valid), R in position 3 (valid), E in position 1 (valid), and introduces L and Y. This seems valid.

EARLY is a good second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (STARE):
- S, T are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (EARLY):
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
1. Letters in the word: A (position 2), R, E.
2. Letters not in the word: S, T, L, Y.
3. Positions for A: fixed at position 2.
4. Positions for R: cannot be 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But position 2 is taken by A, so R must be in 1 or 5.
5. Positions for E: cannot be 1 or 5 → possible positions: 3 or 4.

So the word has the structure:
- Position 1: R or ?
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E or ?
- Position 4: E or ?
- Position 5: R or ?

Given R must be in 1 or 5, and E must be in 3 or 4, let's explore possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 1, E in position 3
Structure: R A E _ _
Letters used so far: R, A, E
Need two more consonants from remaining letters (excluding S, T, L, Y). Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Case 2: R in position 1, E in position 4
Structure: R A _ E _
Need two more consonants.

Case 3: R in position 5, E in position 3
Structure: _ A E _ R
Need two more consonants.

Case 4: R in position 5, E in position 4
Structure: _ A _ E R
Need two more consonants.

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:
- Case 1: R A E _ _ → RAFTS (invalid, has S,T), RACER (has C, good), RAGE (too short), etc. RACER seems possible.
- Case 2: R A _ E _ → RAPED (has D, P), RAVEN (has V, N), etc. RAVEN seems good.
- Case 3: _ A E _ R → CAESR (invalid), MAEER (invalid), PAVER (has V, P), etc. PAVER seems possible.
- Case 4: _ A _ E R → CATER (invalid, has T), PAPER (has P), etc. PAPER seems possible.

Among these, RAVEN fits Case 2 and uses common letters. Let's verify:
- R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (fixed), V and N new, E in position 4 (allowed).
- No S, T, L, Y.
- All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, RAVEN is a good next guess.

- R is in the word (positions 1 or 5 allowed: cannot be 3,4).

From RAVEN feedback (R(-) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x)):
- R was in position 1 and got (-).  So R is NOT in position 1.
Therefore R must be in position 5.

E was in position 4 and got (✓), so E is in position 4.

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ E R

Letters still needed: two distinct consonants from the remaining set (all letters except S,T,L,Y,V,N).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Z.

We want a real 5-letter word matching _ A _ E R.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,wager,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- STARE (uses S,T,A,R,E - all very common)
- SLATE (uses S,L,A,T,E)
- CRANE (uses C,R,A,N,E)
- CRISP (uses C,R,I,S,P)
- ADIEU (uses A,D,I,E,U)

STARE is particularly good because it uses S (very common in initial position), T (common initial), A, R, and E (most common vowel). This combination should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many common letters.

I'll go with STARE as my first guess.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word must contain A, R, E, each in some position other than the one they had in STARE.
- The word cannot contain S or T at all.
- The remaining letters to fill are two more letters (positions 1 and 2) from the remaining alphabet, excluding S and T.

Good letters to try next are consonants that haven’t been tested yet and pair well with A, R, E. Common consonants not yet tested: N, L, C, M, P, D, etc.

A reasonable next word would put A, R, E in new positions and introduce new letters. Let’s try:
- A cannot be in position 3 → try position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.
- R cannot be in position 4 → try position 1,2,3,5.
- E cannot be in position 5 → try position 1,2,3,4.

One word that fits is CRANE:
- C (new letter)
- R (in position 2, new position)
- A (in position 3, but A cannot be in position 3 → invalid)
Oops, that violates the A position.

Next try: PEARL
- P (new)
- E (in position 2, new position)
- A (in position 3 → invalid)
Still invalid.

Try: EARLY
- E (position 1, new)
- A (position 2, new)
- R (position 3, new)
- L (new)
- Y (new)
This uses A in position 2 (valid), R in position 3 (valid), E in position 1 (valid), and introduces L and Y. This seems valid.

EARLY is a good second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (STARE):
- S, T are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (EARLY):
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
1. Letters in the word: A (position 2), R, E.
2. Letters not in the word: S, T, L, Y.
3. Positions for A: fixed at position 2.
4. Positions for R: cannot be 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But position 2 is taken by A, so R must be in 1 or 5.
5. Positions for E: cannot be 1 or 5 → possible positions: 3 or 4.

So the word has the structure:
- Position 1: R or ?
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E or ?
- Position 4: E or ?
- Position 5: R or ?

Given R must be in 1 or 5, and E must be in 3 or 4, let's explore possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 1, E in position 3
Structure: R A E _ _
Letters used so far: R, A, E
Need two more consonants from remaining letters (excluding S, T, L, Y). Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Case 2: R in position 1, E in position 4
Structure: R A _ E _
Need two more consonants.

Case 3: R in position 5, E in position 3
Structure: _ A E _ R
Need two more consonants.

Case 4: R in position 5, E in position 4
Structure: _ A _ E R
Need two more consonants.

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:
- Case 1: R A E _ _ → RAFTS (invalid, has S,T), RACER (has C, good), RAGE (too short), etc. RACER seems possible.
- Case 2: R A _ E _ → RAPED (has D, P), RAVEN (has V, N), etc. RAVEN seems good.
- Case 3: _ A E _ R → CAESR (invalid), MAEER (invalid), PAVER (has V, P), etc. PAVER seems possible.
- Case 4: _ A _ E R → CATER (invalid, has T), PAPER (has P), etc. PAPER seems possible.

Among these, RAVEN fits Case 2 and uses common letters. Let's verify:
- R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (fixed), V and N new, E in position 4 (allowed).
- No S, T, L, Y.
- All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, RAVEN is a good next guess.

Summary of known facts:

Letters in the word:
- A is fixed in position 2 (from EARLY and RAVEN).
- E is in the word (positions 3 or 4 allowed: cannot be 1,5).
- R is in the word (positions 1 or 5 allowed: cannot be 3,4).

Letters NOT in the word:
S, T, L, Y, V, N.

Word pattern so far:
_ A _ _ _
with E and R still to place.

From RAVEN feedback (R(-) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x)):
- R was in position 1 and got (-).  So R is NOT in position 1.
Therefore R must be in position 5.

E was in position 4 and got (✓), so E is in position 4.

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ E R

Letters still needed: two distinct consonants from the remaining set (all letters except S,T,L,Y,V,N).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Z.

We want a real 5-letter word matching _ A _ E R.

Common words fitting this:
C A P E R – P is unused and allowed.
F A K E R – F, K allowed.
M A K E R – M, K allowed.
P A P E R – P is allowed but repeats P; we don’t know if letters can repeat, but up to now no repeats have been hinted.  Since V and N appeared only once in guesses, assume no repeats.

CAPER, FAKER, MAKER, PAPER could all work; CAPER is very common.

Let’s choose CAPER.

Check constraints:
C, A, P, E, R
- S,T,L,Y,V,N absent – OK
- A in position 2 – OK
- E in position 4 – OK
- R in position 5 – OK

We have now used five guesses.  
Current exact pattern: _ A _ E R  
Known letters: A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)  
Known absent letters: S, T, L, Y, V, N, C, P, B, K  

Available consonants for positions 1 and 3 (no repeats allowed):
From the alphabet, remove all excluded letters.  Remaining consonants:
D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Z.

We need a real 5-letter word of the form:
C₁ A C₂ E R
where C₁ and C₂ are from the remaining set.

Real-word list that fits:
- D A M E R   (valid; D, M allowed)
- F A M E R   (invalid, M would repeat)
- G A M E R   (valid; G, M allowed)
- H A M E R   (valid; H, M allowed)
- J A M E R   (valid; J, M allowed)
- M A G E R   (valid; M, G allowed)
- W A G E R   (valid; W, G allowed)

The most common word is “D A M E R” (rare) or the extremely common word “W A G E R”.  
All letters in WAGER are allowed: W and G have never been tested.  
Therefore, WAGER is the logical sixth and final guess.
