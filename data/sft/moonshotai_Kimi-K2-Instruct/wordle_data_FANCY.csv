For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. 

Popular starting words often include:
- A, E as common vowels
- R, S, T, L, N as common consonants

A good balance is ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". ""SLATE"" is particularly strong as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (most frequent vowels)

This gives high potential to identify correct letters and their positions early.

From the feedback:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (all got “x”).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (got “-”).

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A somewhere other than slot 3.
- does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints. Since we’ve already eliminated four very common letters, we should bring in other frequently occurring letters (R, N, I, O, C, etc.) and make sure A appears in a different position.

A strong next guess that avoids the excluded letters and repositions A is “RADIO”.
- R, D, I, O are still-possible letters.
- A is placed in position 2 instead of 3 to test its new location.

From the new feedback:

- R, D, I, O are NOT in the word (all got “x”).
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).

Combining with the earlier feedback:
- Prohibited letters so far: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O (8 letters).
- Guaranteed: A in slot 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We now need a valid 5-letter English word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- None of the 8 excluded letters anywhere in the word.

Remaining common consonants and vowels we can still use include: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, the most frequent are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

A strong next step is to try a word that uses several of these remaining frequent letters while keeping A in position 2, to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “BACON”:
- B, C, N are common and still allowed.
- O is already excluded, so “BACON” is invalid (contains O).

Next candidate: “MANGO” – invalid (O).

Next candidate: “CABIN” – invalid (I).

Next candidate: “FANCY”:
- F, N, C, Y are allowed.
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- FANCY = F A N C Y → fits A in position 2 and avoids all excluded letters.

Thus, FANCY is a valid, information-rich guess.
