For my first guess in Wordle, I want a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants like A, E, T, R, S, etc. A very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about letter presence and position.

Other good options would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like the most balanced choice with good coverage of common letters.

2. TALON → T(✓) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(-)  
   - T is correct in position 1.

- N cannot be in position 5 (from TALON feedback).

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters in the word and their constraints
- T is fixed in position 1.
- O is in the word and in position 2 (from TOADY feedback).
- A is in the word but NOT positions 1, 2, 3.
- N is in the word but NOT positions 1, 5 (from TALON).
- So far the pattern is: T O _ _ _

Letters NOT in the word
- R, S, E, L, D, Y are all eliminated.

Remaining positions to fill
- Positions 3, 4, 5
- A must be in 4 or 5
- N must be in 3 or 4

Let's consider the two cases for N and A:

Case 1: N in position 3
Then the word is T O N _ _
A must be in 4 or 5. Let's try 4: T O N A _ (need a 5th letter that is allowed)

Case 2: N in position 4
Then the word is T O _ N _
A must be in 5: T O _ N A

Let's think of valid 5-letter words under these constraints.

Candidate letters we haven't used yet: C, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Looking at Case 1 (T O N A _):
Possible words: TONAL - but L is eliminated
TONER - E eliminated
TONYA - Y eliminated
None seem valid.

Looking at Case 2 (T O _ N A):
We need a consonant for position 3 that hasn't been eliminated. Good candidates: C, G, M, P, V, W.

Possible words:
TOGNA - not a valid English word
TOVNA - not valid
TOMNA - not valid
TOGNA - no
TOCAN - not valid
TOWN A - TOWN is 4 letters
TONCA - not valid
TOGAN - no
TOVAN - no
TOCAN - no

Wait, let's think differently - maybe T O _ _ N with A in position 4.

Then pattern: T O _ A N
Need a valid consonant for position 3.

Possible candidates: C, G, M, P, V, W.

Looking for real words:
TOCAN - no
TOGAN - no
TOMAN - yes! ""toman"" is a valid 5-letter word (currency unit in some countries)
TOVAN - no
TOWAN - not valid
TOPAN - not valid
TOCAN - no

So ""TOMAN"" seems to be the best candidate that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- T O _ A N
- Uses T (position 1 ✓), O (position 2 ✓), A (position 4), N (position 5)
- Doesn't use any eliminated letters (R,S,E,L,D,Y)
- All letters are in allowed positions per feedback

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants like A, E, T, R, S, etc. A very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Analyzing the feedback from the first guess (AROSE):
- A(-) means A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- R(x) means R is NOT in the word at all
- O(-) means O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
- S(x) means S is NOT in the word at all
- E(x) means E is NOT in the word at all

This tells us:
1. The word contains A and O but not R, S, or E
2. A is not in position 1
3. O is not in position 3

Since we know A and O are in the word, and A can't be first, let's try placing them in different positions. We also know we can't use R, S, or E. Good consonants to try would be T, N, L, etc.

A good candidate word that uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and has common letters would be ""TALON"". This uses:
- T (common consonant)
- A (known to be in word)
- L (common consonant)
- O (known to be in word)
- N (common consonant)

This should help us determine positions of A and O while testing other common letters.

Previous feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

2. TALON → T(✓) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(-)  
   - T is correct in position 1.  
   - A is still in the wrong spot (here it was in position 2, so it’s not 2).  
   - L is NOT in the word.  
   - O is still in the wrong spot (it was in position 4, so it’s not 4).  
   - N is in the word but in the wrong spot.

So far:

- Word pattern: T _ _ _ _ (T fixed in position 1).
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, N.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, L.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
- N cannot be in position 5 (from TALON feedback).

Possible positions for A, O, N in T _ _ _ _:

- A can be 3, 4, or 5.
- O can be 2 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- N can be 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try to fit A, O, N into the remaining four slots.

We need common consonants that haven't been eliminated. Good candidates: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Let’s test a word that satisfies:
- T _ _ _ _
- A, O, N present
- Avoids disallowed letters

Try “TOADY”:
- T in place 1 (✓)
- O in place 2 (possible, since O can be 2 or 5)
- A in place 3 (possible, since A can be 3)
- D (new letter, not yet tested)
- Y (new letter, not yet tested)

This tests positions of O and A while introducing D and Y.

Current information:

1. Four letters are fixed by position:
   - T(✓) in position 1
   - O(✓) in position 2

2. Known letters still to place:
   - A and N are both in the word but wrongly-placed so far.

3. Eliminated letters:
   R, S, E, L, D, Y, M

4. Position restrictions:
   - A cannot be in 1, 2, 3 (from AROSE and TOADY).
   - N cannot be in 1, 5 (from TALON).

So the fixed partial word is:
T O _ _ _

We still need to place:
- A → can only be 4 or 5
- N → can only be 3 or 4

Case A: N is in 3
   T O N _ _
   Then A must be in 4 or 5.

Case B: N is in 4
   T O _ N _
   Then A must be in 5.

Let’s list possible consonants still allowed (not yet eliminated): C, G, H, P, U, V, W, etc.

Case A: T O N _ _
   Need A in 4 or 5.
   - If A in 4: T O N A _ → need consonant for 5.
     Valid 5-letter word: TONAL – but L is eliminated.
     TONKA – K is allowed, and a real word.
   - If A in 5: T O N _ A → need consonant for 4.
     TONCA – no.
     TONGA – G is allowed, and a valid word.

Case B: T O _ N A
   Need consonant for 3: C, G, H, P, V, W.
   TO G N A → TOGNA – not valid.
   TO C N A – TOCNA – invalid.
   TO P N A – TOPNA – invalid.
   TO H N A – TOHNA – invalid.
   TO V N A – TOVNA – invalid.
   TO W N A – TOWN A – TOWN is only 4 letters.

So the only real possibilities from above are TONKA (Case A-A4) and TONGA (Case A-A5).

Both fit all constraints. Between them, TONGA is the more common word. Let’s pick TONGA.
