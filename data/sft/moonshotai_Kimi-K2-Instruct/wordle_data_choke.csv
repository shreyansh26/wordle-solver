For the first guess, I want a word that contains commonly used letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess should use some of these letters to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong choice with S, L, A, T, E. ""AROSE"" is also good with A, R, O, S, E. 

After considering these options, I think ""AROSE"" is excellent as it covers 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.  
- R(x) – R is not in the word.  
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) – S is not in the word.  
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the mystery word has the form: _ _ O _ E
and cannot contain A, R, S.

Good consonants left to try: N, T, L, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (we already know about O and E)

I’ll pick a word that uses fresh letters, covers a variety of common consonants, and fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Candidate words meeting the pattern and avoiding A, R, S:
- CHOKE (C, H, K – all new letters)  
- FOLLY (contains L twice, but F and L are new)  
- JONES (J might be too uncommon for a first guess)  
- TOTEM (repeats T, and T is common)  
- VOGUE (V, G, U – two new vowels)  

Among these, “CHOKE” covers three entirely new consonants (C, H, K) plus keeps the known O and E. It’s a strong second guess to maximize information.
