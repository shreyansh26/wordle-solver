For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that is strategically good at narrowing down possibilities. The best starting words tend to have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the most effective starting words according to Wordle analysis are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'm going to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E) which will immediately tell me which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words
- All unique letters

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and help me narrow down the possibilities quickly for my next guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) : O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word at all.

What we know so far:
1. Letters still possible to be in the word: A (not 1st), O (not 3rd), and any letters we haven’t tried.
2. Letters we can immediately eliminate: R, S, E.
3. Good consonants still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
4. Good vowels still untested: I, U (since A and O are confirmed in word, E is out).

Next word should:
- Keep A and O somewhere (but obey their positional constraints).
- Introduce new common letters to test.
- Avoid R, S, E.

An excellent follow-up is “COBIA”:
- C, B, I are all new letters.
- A stays in (moved to 5th slot, which is allowed).
- O stays in (moved to 2nd slot, which is allowed and satisfies “not 3rd”).

If you prefer a word that doesn’t reuse letters until we know more, “COBIA” is still fine because it introduces I and B which are high-frequency. Alternatively, “MOUNT” is good, but it reuses O in 2nd and introduces U and N and T, but it drops A. Since we know A must be in, it’s better to keep A in, so “COBIA” is slightly better.

Summary of what we know:

1. Letters we have:
   - C — fixed in position 1 (✓)
   - O — in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
   - A — in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

2. Letters we can rule out entirely:
   R, S, E, B, I  (from both guesses)

3. Letters still untested that are common in 5-letter words:
   Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
   Vowels: U  (since A and O are already confirmed, E and I are out)

4. Structure we need:
   C _ _ _ _   (C locked at position 1)
   A must appear somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
   O must appear somewhere in positions 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

Good candidates meeting these constraints:
- C A N O _  → but N and the last letter would have to be untried and fit.
- C A M O _  → same issue.
- C O A _ _  → but O cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), so COA__ is impossible.
- C _ A O _  → e.g., C L A O D, C L A O N, C H A O S, etc.

Focus on C _ A O _ pattern:
   - 1st: C ✓
   - 3rd: A ✓
   - 4th: O ✓
   - 2nd and 5th letters: must be consonants not yet used (so not R,S,B) and not I.

A common word that fits is CHAOS:
   C(1) ✓
   H — untested
   A(3) ✓
   O(4) ✓
   S — already ruled out (from guess 1) → so CHAOS is invalid.

CHAOS fails because S is out.

Next candidate: CL A O N → CLAON (not a word).

Another candidate: CL A O D → CLAOD (not a word).

Look at C _ _ A _ with O elsewhere, but O must be in positions 3,4, or 5. If A is in 3rd, then O has to be 4th or 5th. We already tried C _ A O _.

Try C _ _ _ A with O in 3rd or 4th:
   - C O _ _ A → but O cannot be 2nd, but 2nd is allowed if we put O in 3rd or 4th. Actually, O cannot be 2nd (from guess 2 feedback), but 2nd is position 2, so CO__A is invalid because O would be 2nd. So O must be 3rd or 4th.

Candidate: C _ O _ A
   - C L O U A — but U and L are untried, but CLOUA is not a common word.
   - C H O C A — repeat C not allowed (no info on duplicates, but conservative).
   - C H O R A — R is out.
   - C P O K A — unlikely.

Best practical word seems to be COLON:
   - C(1) ✓
   - O(2) — but feedback says O is not in 2nd position (-), so COLON is invalid.

Next: C A _ O _ pattern:
   - C A _ O _ , but A must be in 2,3, or 4 (currently 2nd), O must be 3,4, or 5 (currently 4th). So C A _ O _ looks legal.
   - C A L O W — not word.
   - C A N O N — N is untried, double N is possible, but CANON is a word. However, second N is in 5th, and A is 2nd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed). Let's check letters: C, A, N, O, N — N is untested, so okay.

CANON seems valid.

Alternatively, CAPON (P is untried), but CANON is more common.

So I'll go with CANON.

2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the most effective starting words according to Wordle analysis are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'm going to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E) which will immediately tell me which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words
- All unique letters

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and help me narrow down the possibilities quickly for my next guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) : O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word at all.

What we know so far:
1. Letters still possible to be in the word: A (not 1st), O (not 3rd), and any letters we haven’t tried.
2. Letters we can immediately eliminate: R, S, E.
3. Good consonants still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
4. Good vowels still untested: I, U (since A and O are confirmed in word, E is out).

Next word should:
- Keep A and O somewhere (but obey their positional constraints).
- Introduce new common letters to test.
- Avoid R, S, E.

An excellent follow-up is “COBIA”:
- C, B, I are all new letters.
- A stays in (moved to 5th slot, which is allowed).
- O stays in (moved to 2nd slot, which is allowed and satisfies “not 3rd”).

If you prefer a word that doesn’t reuse letters until we know more, “COBIA” is still fine because it introduces I and B which are high-frequency. Alternatively, “MOUNT” is good, but it reuses O in 2nd and introduces U and N and T, but it drops A. Since we know A must be in, it’s better to keep A in, so “COBIA” is slightly better.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know:

1. Letters we have:
   - C — fixed in position 1 (✓)
   - O — in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
   - A — in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

2. Letters we can rule out entirely:
   R, S, E, B, I  (from both guesses)

3. Letters still untested that are common in 5-letter words:
   Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
   Vowels: U  (since A and O are already confirmed, E and I are out)

4. Structure we need:
   C _ _ _ _   (C locked at position 1)
   A must appear somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
   O must appear somewhere in positions 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

Good candidates meeting these constraints:
- C A N O _  → but N and the last letter would have to be untried and fit.
- C A M O _  → same issue.
- C O A _ _  → but O cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), so COA__ is impossible.
- C _ A O _  → e.g., C L A O D, C L A O N, C H A O S, etc.

Focus on C _ A O _ pattern:
   - 1st: C ✓
   - 3rd: A ✓
   - 4th: O ✓
   - 2nd and 5th letters: must be consonants not yet used (so not R,S,B) and not I.

A common word that fits is CHAOS:
   C(1) ✓
   H — untested
   A(3) ✓
   O(4) ✓
   S — already ruled out (from guess 1) → so CHAOS is invalid.

CHAOS fails because S is out.

Next candidate: CL A O N → CLAON (not a word).

Another candidate: CL A O D → CLAOD (not a word).

Look at C _ _ A _ with O elsewhere, but O must be in positions 3,4, or 5. If A is in 3rd, then O has to be 4th or 5th. We already tried C _ A O _.

Try C _ _ _ A with O in 3rd or 4th:
   - C O _ _ A → but O cannot be 2nd, but 2nd is allowed if we put O in 3rd or 4th. Actually, O cannot be 2nd (from guess 2 feedback), but 2nd is position 2, so CO__A is invalid because O would be 2nd. So O must be 3rd or 4th.

Candidate: C _ O _ A
   - C L O U A — but U and L are untried, but CLOUA is not a common word.
   - C H O C A — repeat C not allowed (no info on duplicates, but conservative).
   - C H O R A — R is out.
   - C P O K A — unlikely.

Best practical word seems to be COLON:
   - C(1) ✓
   - O(2) — but feedback says O is not in 2nd position (-), so COLON is invalid.

Next: C A _ O _ pattern:
   - C A _ O _ , but A must be in 2,3, or 4 (currently 2nd), O must be 3,4, or 5 (currently 4th). So C A _ O _ looks legal.
   - C A L O W — not word.
   - C A N O N — N is untried, double N is possible, but CANON is a word. However, second N is in 5th, and A is 2nd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed). Let's check letters: C, A, N, O, N — N is untested, so okay.

CANON seems valid.

Alternatively, CAPON (P is untried), but CANON is more common.

So I'll go with CANON.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- C is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (- feedback in guess 2 & 3).  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (- feedback in guesses 2 & 3).  That only leaves position 4 for O.

Therefore:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: O
- Position 3 or 4 must also hold A.  But position 4 is already O, so A must be in position 3.

Current partial word: C _ A O _

Letters already ruled out completely:
R, S, E, B, I, N.

Remaining consonants (and the one vowel left, U) that have not been tested:
D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with C, having A in position 3 and O in position 4 that uses only untested letters for positions 2 and 5.  The word must be common enough to be in the Wordle dictionary.

Candidate words:
- C H A O S — but S is ruled out.
- C L A O W — “CLAOW” is not a valid word.
- C M A O _ — no common word.
- C T A O _ — no common word.
- C U A O _ — “CUAON” etc. not valid.
- C H A O K — “CHAOK” invalid.
- C P A O _ — invalid.
- C L A O D — “CLAOD” invalid.
- C H A O M — invalid.
The only common word that fits is C H A O S, but S is eliminated.

Therefore we must use U, the only untested vowel, for position 2 or 5, and a consonant for the other.

But position 2 must be a consonant (because C is already 1st).  So:
- C U A O _ — position 5 must be an untested consonant.  “CUAO_” needs a consonant.  “CUAOK” invalid, “CUAOP” invalid, “CUAOT” invalid.  None of these are words.

Wait, this suggests we missed testing L.  We never tried L.

So try C L A O _ again but with an untested consonant for position 5 that forms a real word.

Real word: C L A O T — not valid.
C L A O M — not valid.

Actually, there is one: C H A O S but again S is out.

Next candidate: C T A O _ — nothing valid.

Another candidate: C R A O _ — R is out.

Let me list all remaining consonants not yet used: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U (vowel), W, Y.

The only realistic word left is C H A O _ — but again S is out.

I missed C H A O K — but CHAOK isn't valid.

Wait, C H A O S is the only word, but S is ruled out.

This leads me to believe the word must be C H A O _ with a consonant not yet ruled out.  Actually, we have not tried H.  Let’s consider C H A O K — invalid.

The only valid word that fits C _ A O _ is CHAOS, but S is out.

Therefore the word must be C _ A O _ with a different 5th letter using untested consonants.  I see no common word.  Let me reconsider.

Have I made a mistake?

From guess 3 (CANON):
- C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)

This shows A is in position 2 (✓) — but earlier feedback was “A(-)” in CANON which means A is correct in position 2.  This contradicts earlier feedback.

Wait, no — in guess 3 feedback: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x).  This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- N is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 4.

This is different from earlier.  Let me re-parse all feedback accurately.

Re-parsing all feedback:

1. AROSE: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in word, wrong position.
   - R, S, E not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong position.

2. COBIA: C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - O is wrong in position 2, but still in word.
   - B, I not in word.
   - A is in word, wrong in position 5.

3. CANON: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - A is correct in position 2.
   - N is not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong in position 4.

Therefore current constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A
- O must be in position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out by feedback).
- Cannot use R, S, E, B, I, N.

Word pattern so far: C A _ _ _ or C A _ O _ or C A _ _ O.

But O must be present, and position 3 or 5.

Candidate:
C A M O _ — not valid.
C A P O _ — not valid.
C A G O _ — not valid.
C A L O _ — not valid.

Wait, position 3 or 5 for O.

Thus:
- C A _ _ O — then position 3 and 4 must be consonants.
- C A _ O _ — then position 5 must be consonant.

Looking for common words:
- C A G O O — invalid (double O).
- C A L O R — R is out.
- C A B O T — B is out.
- C A G O D — invalid.
- C A H O W — “CAHOW” is a seabird, but uncommon.
- C A D O _ — “CADOG” invalid.
- C A L O M — invalid.
- C A T O O — invalid.

The only valid and common word left is C A T C H — but doesn’t fit.

Real common word: C A M P O — but P is untried, M is untried, O is in position 5.  CAMPO is a valid word (Spanish-derived: “campo”).  Let’s try it.

Letters: C, A, M, P, O — none are ruled out except N, so this is valid.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that is strategically good at narrowing down possibilities. The best starting words tend to have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the most effective starting words according to Wordle analysis are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'm going to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E) which will immediately tell me which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words
- All unique letters

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and help me narrow down the possibilities quickly for my next guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) : O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word at all.

What we know so far:
1. Letters still possible to be in the word: A (not 1st), O (not 3rd), and any letters we haven’t tried.
2. Letters we can immediately eliminate: R, S, E.
3. Good consonants still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
4. Good vowels still untested: I, U (since A and O are confirmed in word, E is out).

Next word should:
- Keep A and O somewhere (but obey their positional constraints).
- Introduce new common letters to test.
- Avoid R, S, E.

An excellent follow-up is “COBIA”:
- C, B, I are all new letters.
- A stays in (moved to 5th slot, which is allowed).
- O stays in (moved to 2nd slot, which is allowed and satisfies “not 3rd”).

If you prefer a word that doesn’t reuse letters until we know more, “COBIA” is still fine because it introduces I and B which are high-frequency. Alternatively, “MOUNT” is good, but it reuses O in 2nd and introduces U and N and T, but it drops A. Since we know A must be in, it’s better to keep A in, so “COBIA” is slightly better.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know:

1. Letters we have:
   - C — fixed in position 1 (✓)
   - O — in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
   - A — in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

2. Letters we can rule out entirely:
   R, S, E, B, I  (from both guesses)

3. Letters still untested that are common in 5-letter words:
   Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
   Vowels: U  (since A and O are already confirmed, E and I are out)

4. Structure we need:
   C _ _ _ _   (C locked at position 1)
   A must appear somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
   O must appear somewhere in positions 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

Good candidates meeting these constraints:
- C A N O _  → but N and the last letter would have to be untried and fit.
- C A M O _  → same issue.
- C O A _ _  → but O cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), so COA__ is impossible.
- C _ A O _  → e.g., C L A O D, C L A O N, C H A O S, etc.

Focus on C _ A O _ pattern:
   - 1st: C ✓
   - 3rd: A ✓
   - 4th: O ✓
   - 2nd and 5th letters: must be consonants not yet used (so not R,S,B) and not I.

A common word that fits is CHAOS:
   C(1) ✓
   H — untested
   A(3) ✓
   O(4) ✓
   S — already ruled out (from guess 1) → so CHAOS is invalid.

CHAOS fails because S is out.

Next candidate: CL A O N → CLAON (not a word).

Another candidate: CL A O D → CLAOD (not a word).

Look at C _ _ A _ with O elsewhere, but O must be in positions 3,4, or 5. If A is in 3rd, then O has to be 4th or 5th. We already tried C _ A O _.

Try C _ _ _ A with O in 3rd or 4th:
   - C O _ _ A → but O cannot be 2nd, but 2nd is allowed if we put O in 3rd or 4th. Actually, O cannot be 2nd (from guess 2 feedback), but 2nd is position 2, so CO__A is invalid because O would be 2nd. So O must be 3rd or 4th.

Candidate: C _ O _ A
   - C L O U A — but U and L are untried, but CLOUA is not a common word.
   - C H O C A — repeat C not allowed (no info on duplicates, but conservative).
   - C H O R A — R is out.
   - C P O K A — unlikely.

Best practical word seems to be COLON:
   - C(1) ✓
   - O(2) — but feedback says O is not in 2nd position (-), so COLON is invalid.

Next: C A _ O _ pattern:
   - C A _ O _ , but A must be in 2,3, or 4 (currently 2nd), O must be 3,4, or 5 (currently 4th). So C A _ O _ looks legal.
   - C A L O W — not word.
   - C A N O N — N is untried, double N is possible, but CANON is a word. However, second N is in 5th, and A is 2nd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed). Let's check letters: C, A, N, O, N — N is untested, so okay.

CANON seems valid.

Alternatively, CAPON (P is untried), but CANON is more common.

So I'll go with CANON.

<guess>CANON</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- C is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (- feedback in guess 2 & 3).  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (- feedback in guesses 2 & 3).  That only leaves position 4 for O.

Therefore:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: O
- Position 3 or 4 must also hold A.  But position 4 is already O, so A must be in position 3.

Current partial word: C _ A O _

Letters already ruled out completely:
R, S, E, B, I, N.

Remaining consonants (and the one vowel left, U) that have not been tested:
D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with C, having A in position 3 and O in position 4 that uses only untested letters for positions 2 and 5.  The word must be common enough to be in the Wordle dictionary.

Candidate words:
- C H A O S — but S is ruled out.
- C L A O W — “CLAOW” is not a valid word.
- C M A O _ — no common word.
- C T A O _ — no common word.
- C U A O _ — “CUAON” etc. not valid.
- C H A O K — “CHAOK” invalid.
- C P A O _ — invalid.
- C L A O D — “CLAOD” invalid.
- C H A O M — invalid.
The only common word that fits is C H A O S, but S is eliminated.

Therefore we must use U, the only untested vowel, for position 2 or 5, and a consonant for the other.

But position 2 must be a consonant (because C is already 1st).  So:
- C U A O _ — position 5 must be an untested consonant.  “CUAO_” needs a consonant.  “CUAOK” invalid, “CUAOP” invalid, “CUAOT” invalid.  None of these are words.

Wait, this suggests we missed testing L.  We never tried L.

So try C L A O _ again but with an untested consonant for position 5 that forms a real word.

Real word: C L A O T — not valid.
C L A O M — not valid.

Actually, there is one: C H A O S but again S is out.

Next candidate: C T A O _ — nothing valid.

Another candidate: C R A O _ — R is out.

Let me list all remaining consonants not yet used: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U (vowel), W, Y.

The only realistic word left is C H A O _ — but again S is out.

I missed C H A O K — but CHAOK isn't valid.

Wait, C H A O S is the only word, but S is ruled out.

This leads me to believe the word must be C H A O _ with a consonant not yet ruled out.  Actually, we have not tried H.  Let’s consider C H A O K — invalid.

The only valid word that fits C _ A O _ is CHAOS, but S is out.

Therefore the word must be C _ A O _ with a different 5th letter using untested consonants.  I see no common word.  Let me reconsider.

Have I made a mistake?

From guess 3 (CANON):
- C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)

This shows A is in position 2 (✓) — but earlier feedback was “A(-)” in CANON which means A is correct in position 2.  This contradicts earlier feedback.

Wait, no — in guess 3 feedback: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x).  This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- N is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 4.

This is different from earlier.  Let me re-parse all feedback accurately.

Re-parsing all feedback:

1. AROSE: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in word, wrong position.
   - R, S, E not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong position.

2. COBIA: C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - O is wrong in position 2, but still in word.
   - B, I not in word.
   - A is in word, wrong in position 5.

3. CANON: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - A is correct in position 2.
   - N is not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong in position 4.

Therefore current constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A
- O must be in position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out by feedback).
- Cannot use R, S, E, B, I, N.

Word pattern so far: C A _ _ _ or C A _ O _ or C A _ _ O.

But O must be present, and position 3 or 5.

Candidate:
C A M O _ — not valid.
C A P O _ — not valid.
C A G O _ — not valid.
C A L O _ — not valid.

Wait, position 3 or 5 for O.

Thus:
- C A _ _ O — then position 3 and 4 must be consonants.
- C A _ O _ — then position 5 must be consonant.

Looking for common words:
- C A G O O — invalid (double O).
- C A L O R — R is out.
- C A B O T — B is out.
- C A G O D — invalid.
- C A H O W — “CAHOW” is a seabird, but uncommon.
- C A D O _ — “CADOG” invalid.
- C A L O M — invalid.
- C A T O O — invalid.

The only valid and common word left is C A T C H — but doesn’t fit.

Real common word: C A M P O — but P is untried, M is untried, O is in position 5.  CAMPO is a valid word (Spanish-derived: “campo”).  Let’s try it.

Letters: C, A, M, P, O — none are ruled out except N, so this is valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,CACAO,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that is strategically good at narrowing down possibilities. The best starting words tend to have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Some of the most effective starting words according to Wordle analysis are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'm going to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three very common vowels (A, O, E) which will immediately tell me which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words
- All unique letters

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and help me narrow down the possibilities quickly for my next guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) : O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word at all.

What we know so far:
1. Letters still possible to be in the word: A (not 1st), O (not 3rd), and any letters we haven’t tried.
2. Letters we can immediately eliminate: R, S, E.
3. Good consonants still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
4. Good vowels still untested: I, U (since A and O are confirmed in word, E is out).

Next word should:
- Keep A and O somewhere (but obey their positional constraints).
- Introduce new common letters to test.
- Avoid R, S, E.

An excellent follow-up is “COBIA”:
- C, B, I are all new letters.
- A stays in (moved to 5th slot, which is allowed).
- O stays in (moved to 2nd slot, which is allowed and satisfies “not 3rd”).

If you prefer a word that doesn’t reuse letters until we know more, “COBIA” is still fine because it introduces I and B which are high-frequency. Alternatively, “MOUNT” is good, but it reuses O in 2nd and introduces U and N and T, but it drops A. Since we know A must be in, it’s better to keep A in, so “COBIA” is slightly better.

Guess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know:

1. Letters we have:
   - C — fixed in position 1 (✓)
   - O — in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
   - A — in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

2. Letters we can rule out entirely:
   R, S, E, B, I  (from both guesses)

3. Letters still untested that are common in 5-letter words:
   Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
   Vowels: U  (since A and O are already confirmed, E and I are out)

4. Structure we need:
   C _ _ _ _   (C locked at position 1)
   A must appear somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
   O must appear somewhere in positions 3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

Good candidates meeting these constraints:
- C A N O _  → but N and the last letter would have to be untried and fit.
- C A M O _  → same issue.
- C O A _ _  → but O cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), so COA__ is impossible.
- C _ A O _  → e.g., C L A O D, C L A O N, C H A O S, etc.

Focus on C _ A O _ pattern:
   - 1st: C ✓
   - 3rd: A ✓
   - 4th: O ✓
   - 2nd and 5th letters: must be consonants not yet used (so not R,S,B) and not I.

A common word that fits is CHAOS:
   C(1) ✓
   H — untested
   A(3) ✓
   O(4) ✓
   S — already ruled out (from guess 1) → so CHAOS is invalid.

CHAOS fails because S is out.

Next candidate: CL A O N → CLAON (not a word).

Another candidate: CL A O D → CLAOD (not a word).

Look at C _ _ A _ with O elsewhere, but O must be in positions 3,4, or 5. If A is in 3rd, then O has to be 4th or 5th. We already tried C _ A O _.

Try C _ _ _ A with O in 3rd or 4th:
   - C O _ _ A → but O cannot be 2nd, but 2nd is allowed if we put O in 3rd or 4th. Actually, O cannot be 2nd (from guess 2 feedback), but 2nd is position 2, so CO__A is invalid because O would be 2nd. So O must be 3rd or 4th.

Candidate: C _ O _ A
   - C L O U A — but U and L are untried, but CLOUA is not a common word.
   - C H O C A — repeat C not allowed (no info on duplicates, but conservative).
   - C H O R A — R is out.
   - C P O K A — unlikely.

Best practical word seems to be COLON:
   - C(1) ✓
   - O(2) — but feedback says O is not in 2nd position (-), so COLON is invalid.

Next: C A _ O _ pattern:
   - C A _ O _ , but A must be in 2,3, or 4 (currently 2nd), O must be 3,4, or 5 (currently 4th). So C A _ O _ looks legal.
   - C A L O W — not word.
   - C A N O N — N is untried, double N is possible, but CANON is a word. However, second N is in 5th, and A is 2nd (allowed), O is 4th (allowed). Let's check letters: C, A, N, O, N — N is untested, so okay.

CANON seems valid.

Alternatively, CAPON (P is untried), but CANON is more common.

So I'll go with CANON.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)
Guess 3: CANON -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- C is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (- feedback in guess 2 & 3).  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (- feedback in guesses 2 & 3).  That only leaves position 4 for O.

Therefore:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: O
- Position 3 or 4 must also hold A.  But position 4 is already O, so A must be in position 3.

Current partial word: C _ A O _

Letters already ruled out completely:
R, S, E, B, I, N.

Remaining consonants (and the one vowel left, U) that have not been tested:
D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with C, having A in position 3 and O in position 4 that uses only untested letters for positions 2 and 5.  The word must be common enough to be in the Wordle dictionary.

Candidate words:
- C H A O S — but S is ruled out.
- C L A O W — “CLAOW” is not a valid word.
- C M A O _ — no common word.
- C T A O _ — no common word.
- C U A O _ — “CUAON” etc. not valid.
- C H A O K — “CHAOK” invalid.
- C P A O _ — invalid.
- C L A O D — “CLAOD” invalid.
- C H A O M — invalid.
The only common word that fits is C H A O S, but S is eliminated.

Therefore we must use U, the only untested vowel, for position 2 or 5, and a consonant for the other.

But position 2 must be a consonant (because C is already 1st).  So:
- C U A O _ — position 5 must be an untested consonant.  “CUAO_” needs a consonant.  “CUAOK” invalid, “CUAOP” invalid, “CUAOT” invalid.  None of these are words.

Wait, this suggests we missed testing L.  We never tried L.

So try C L A O _ again but with an untested consonant for position 5 that forms a real word.

Real word: C L A O T — not valid.
C L A O M — not valid.

Actually, there is one: C H A O S but again S is out.

Next candidate: C T A O _ — nothing valid.

Another candidate: C R A O _ — R is out.

Let me list all remaining consonants not yet used: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U (vowel), W, Y.

The only realistic word left is C H A O _ — but again S is out.

I missed C H A O K — but CHAOK isn't valid.

Wait, C H A O S is the only word, but S is ruled out.

This leads me to believe the word must be C H A O _ with a consonant not yet ruled out.  Actually, we have not tried H.  Let’s consider C H A O K — invalid.

The only valid word that fits C _ A O _ is CHAOS, but S is out.

Therefore the word must be C _ A O _ with a different 5th letter using untested consonants.  I see no common word.  Let me reconsider.

Have I made a mistake?

From guess 3 (CANON):
- C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)

This shows A is in position 2 (✓) — but earlier feedback was “A(-)” in CANON which means A is correct in position 2.  This contradicts earlier feedback.

Wait, no — in guess 3 feedback: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x).  This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- N is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 4.

This is different from earlier.  Let me re-parse all feedback accurately.

Re-parsing all feedback:

1. AROSE: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in word, wrong position.
   - R, S, E not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong position.

2. COBIA: C(✓) O(-) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - O is wrong in position 2, but still in word.
   - B, I not in word.
   - A is in word, wrong in position 5.

3. CANON: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x)
   - C is correct in position 1.
   - A is correct in position 2.
   - N is not in word.
   - O is in word, wrong in position 4.

Therefore current constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A
- O must be in position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out by feedback).
- Cannot use R, S, E, B, I, N.

Word pattern so far: C A _ _ _ or C A _ O _ or C A _ _ O.

But O must be present, and position 3 or 5.

Candidate:
C A M O _ — not valid.
C A P O _ — not valid.
C A G O _ — not valid.
C A L O _ — not valid.

Wait, position 3 or 5 for O.

Thus:
- C A _ _ O — then position 3 and 4 must be consonants.
- C A _ O _ — then position 5 must be consonant.

Looking for common words:
- C A G O O — invalid (double O).
- C A L O R — R is out.
- C A B O T — B is out.
- C A G O D — invalid.
- C A H O W — “CAHOW” is a seabird, but uncommon.
- C A D O _ — “CADOG” invalid.
- C A L O M — invalid.
- C A T O O — invalid.

The only valid and common word left is C A T C H — but doesn’t fit.

Real common word: C A M P O — but P is untried, M is untried, O is in position 5.  CAMPO is a valid word (Spanish-derived: “campo”).  Let’s try it.

Letters: C, A, M, P, O — none are ruled out except N, so this is valid.

Actually, we have not tried H.

This contradicts earlier feedback.\n\nWait, no — in guess 3 feedback: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(-) N(x).  This means:\n- C is correct in position 1.\n- A is correct in position 2.\n- N is not in the word.\n- O is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nThis is different from earlier.

1. Fixed positions

   - Position 2: A (✓)  
   - Position 5: O (✓)

   So the word must look exactly like:  
   C A _ _ O

2. Letters that have been **eliminated** (appear nowhere in the word)  
   R, S, E, B, I, N, M, P, D

3. Still-allowed letters (common, and not yet tested)  
   Consonants: F, G, H, K, L, T, V, W, Y  
   Vowels: none left to test (A and O are already placed, E and I are out).

4. We need two **distinct** consonants for positions 3 and 4, chosen only from the still-allowed list.

5. Enumerate common 5-letter English words of the form CA??O with no banned letters:

   - CAFIO – doesn’t exist.  
   - CAGIO – doesn’t exist.  
   - CAKIO – doesn’t exist.  
   - CALDO – “L” and “D”; D is out.  
   - CALTO – not a word.  
   - CALVO – “V” is allowed, but CALVO is obscure.  
   - CARGO – “R” is out.  
   - CATHO – not a word.  
   - CAVYO – not a word.  
   - CAYCO – not a word.

   The only **common** word left is **CARGO**, but **R** is already eliminated.

   Re-examining – I missed **CAHOO**, but that’s not a word.

   Actually, **CAL** + **F** + **O** = **CALFO** – non-existent.

   Another candidate: **CA** + **L** + **K** + **O** = **CALKO** – invalid.

   The only remaining real word that fits and uses allowed letters is **CALVO**, but that is fairly obscure and not in the usual Wordle list.

   However, Wordle’s dictionary **does** include “CALVO”.

   Since every other possibility fails, CALVO is the logical next choice.
