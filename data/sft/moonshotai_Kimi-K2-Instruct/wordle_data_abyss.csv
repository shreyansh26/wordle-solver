For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can reveal vowel positions early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, T, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that contains S and A, avoids positions 1 (for S) and 3 (for A), and excludes L, T, E.

Let me look for words with S somewhere other than first and A somewhere other than third, while avoiding forbidden letters. Good candidates might be words like:
- CHASM (C H A S M) – A is in position 3, so this is invalid.
- BASIN – A is in position 2, S in position 3: this is valid (A not in 3, S not in 1).
- DASH – too short.
- CRASH – no A.
- SNACK – A is in position 3: invalid.
- GASP – too short.
- STAND – has T and A in position 3: invalid.
- WASH – too short.

BASIN seems good: B A S I N (A in 2, S in 3: both positions avoid forbidden spots, and no L/T/E).

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" has A in position 3 (invalid), ""SANDY"" has S in 1 (invalid), ""STARK"" has T and S in 1 (invalid).

Another option: ""SNAIL"" – but L is forbidden.
""SHARK"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SCARF"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SWAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).

""SAMBA"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SUGAR"" – A in 4 (valid), S in 1 (invalid).
""RASPY"" – A in 2 (valid), S in 3 (valid), no forbidden letters.

RASPY seems valid:
- R A S P Y

But let me check BASIN first: B A S I N – positions are (1)B, (2)A, (3)S, (4)I, (5)N. A is in 2, S in 3 – both avoid forbidden positions.

Round 1 (SLATE):

- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

Round 2 (BASIN):
- B(-) → B is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in BASIN it was in position 2 and still “-”).
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

Summary of known facts so far:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: S, A, B (each shows “-” in feedback).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N.
3. Positions ruled out for each of those known letters:
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (since it got “-” when it was in both 3 and 2).
   - B cannot be in position 1.

4. Allowed positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 4, or 5.
   - A: positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - B: positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. Need a 5-letter word that contains S, A, B exactly once each, avoids the forbidden letters (L, T, E, I, N), and respects the positional exclusions above.

Let’s list candidate letters:
- Vowels allowed: A (already must appear), and possibly O, U (since E and I are out).
- Consonants allowed: S, B (must appear), plus any from {C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z}. Lower-case common ones: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, W.

We need:
- Exactly one S, one A, one B.
- Two additional letters from the allowed set.

Let’s brainstorm words:

1. SCRAB → fits: S, C, R, A, B. Check positions:
   - S (position 1) → forbidden. Reject.
2. CRABS → letters C, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
3. BARBS → has two B’s → reject (only one B allowed).
4. SABER → contains E → reject.
5. BARDS → letters B, A, R, D, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 2) → forbidden. Reject.
6. SABLE → contains E → reject.
7. SCABS → letters S, C, A, B, S → two S’s → reject.
8. DRABS → letters D, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
9. BRASH → contains H (allowed), letters B, R, A, S, H. Check positions:
   - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
10. BARFS → letters B, A, R, F, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
11. CRAGS → lacks A. Reject.
12. ACRID → contains I → reject.
13. BOARS → letters B, O, A, R, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
14. ARSON → contains N → reject.
15. COBAS → letters C, O, B, A, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 3) → allowed.
    - A (pos 4) → allowed.
    - S (pos 5) → allowed.
    - No forbidden letters.
    - Valid.

COBAS fits all constraints so far. (It’s a plural of “coba,” an acceptable 5-letter form in English according to word lists.)

Let’s confirm:
- Contains S, A, B each once.
- Does not contain L, T, E, I, N.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- B is in position 3 (allowed).

Therefore, COBAS is a valid next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,abyss,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can reveal vowel positions early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, T, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that contains S and A, avoids positions 1 (for S) and 3 (for A), and excludes L, T, E.

Let me look for words with S somewhere other than first and A somewhere other than third, while avoiding forbidden letters. Good candidates might be words like:
- CHASM (C H A S M) – A is in position 3, so this is invalid.
- BASIN – A is in position 2, S in position 3: this is valid (A not in 3, S not in 1).
- DASH – too short.
- CRASH – no A.
- SNACK – A is in position 3: invalid.
- GASP – too short.
- STAND – has T and A in position 3: invalid.
- WASH – too short.

BASIN seems good: B A S I N (A in 2, S in 3: both positions avoid forbidden spots, and no L/T/E).

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" has A in position 3 (invalid), ""SANDY"" has S in 1 (invalid), ""STARK"" has T and S in 1 (invalid).

Another option: ""SNAIL"" – but L is forbidden.
""SHARK"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SCARF"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SWAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).

""SAMBA"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SUGAR"" – A in 4 (valid), S in 1 (invalid).
""RASPY"" – A in 2 (valid), S in 3 (valid), no forbidden letters.

RASPY seems valid:
- R A S P Y
- A in 2 (not 3), S in 3 (not 1), no L/T/E.

But let me check BASIN first: B A S I N – positions are (1)B, (2)A, (3)S, (4)I, (5)N. A is in 2, S in 3 – both avoid forbidden positions.

Both RASPY and BASIN seem valid. I'll go with BASIN as it introduces new consonants (B, N) and the vowel I.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BASIN -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

Round 2 (BASIN):
- B(-) → B is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in BASIN it was in position 2 and still “-”).
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

Summary of known facts so far:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: S, A, B (each shows “-” in feedback).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N.
3. Positions ruled out for each of those known letters:
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (since it got “-” when it was in both 3 and 2).
   - B cannot be in position 1.

4. Allowed positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 4, or 5.
   - A: positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - B: positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. Need a 5-letter word that contains S, A, B exactly once each, avoids the forbidden letters (L, T, E, I, N), and respects the positional exclusions above.

Let’s list candidate letters:
- Vowels allowed: A (already must appear), and possibly O, U (since E and I are out).
- Consonants allowed: S, B (must appear), plus any from {C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z}. Lower-case common ones: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, W.

We need:
- Exactly one S, one A, one B.
- Two additional letters from the allowed set.

Let’s brainstorm words:

1. SCRAB → fits: S, C, R, A, B. Check positions:
   - S (position 1) → forbidden. Reject.
2. CRABS → letters C, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
3. BARBS → has two B’s → reject (only one B allowed).
4. SABER → contains E → reject.
5. BARDS → letters B, A, R, D, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 2) → forbidden. Reject.
6. SABLE → contains E → reject.
7. SCABS → letters S, C, A, B, S → two S’s → reject.
8. DRABS → letters D, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
9. BRASH → contains H (allowed), letters B, R, A, S, H. Check positions:
   - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
10. BARFS → letters B, A, R, F, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
11. CRAGS → lacks A. Reject.
12. ACRID → contains I → reject.
13. BOARS → letters B, O, A, R, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
14. ARSON → contains N → reject.
15. COBAS → letters C, O, B, A, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 3) → allowed.
    - A (pos 4) → allowed.
    - S (pos 5) → allowed.
    - No forbidden letters.
    - Valid.

COBAS fits all constraints so far. (It’s a plural of “coba,” an acceptable 5-letter form in English according to word lists.)

Let’s confirm:
- Contains S, A, B each once.
- Does not contain L, T, E, I, N.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- B is in position 3 (allowed).

Therefore, COBAS is a valid next guess.

So, we now KNOW:
- S is fixed in position 5.
- B must be somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3 or 5).
- A must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are now excluded for A).

We need a 5-letter word ending with S, with B in 2 or 4, and A in 1 or 2, and avoiding all the letters we know are out: L, T, E, I, N, C, O.

Valid letters left include: A, B, S (already placed), plus D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. We still need two more letters from these.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- Since S is fixed at position 5, the word ends with S.
- Case 1: A in position 1 and B in position 2 → A B _ _ S.
  - We need two more letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set, not repeating A, B, or S, and avoiding banned letters.
  - Possible fills: A B D ? S (but must be 5 letters). Examples: A B D (needs two more letters). Let’s think of real words: ABRUP (not a word), ABRYS (not a word), ABFMS (nonsense). ABRIS – ""abris"" is a word (plural of abri), but I is forbidden. ABRAS – contains A twice (invalid). ABRDS – not a word. So no valid word here.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can reveal vowel positions early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, T, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that contains S and A, avoids positions 1 (for S) and 3 (for A), and excludes L, T, E.

Let me look for words with S somewhere other than first and A somewhere other than third, while avoiding forbidden letters. Good candidates might be words like:
- CHASM (C H A S M) – A is in position 3, so this is invalid.
- BASIN – A is in position 2, S in position 3: this is valid (A not in 3, S not in 1).
- DASH – too short.
- CRASH – no A.
- SNACK – A is in position 3: invalid.
- GASP – too short.
- STAND – has T and A in position 3: invalid.
- WASH – too short.

BASIN seems good: B A S I N (A in 2, S in 3: both positions avoid forbidden spots, and no L/T/E).

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" has A in position 3 (invalid), ""SANDY"" has S in 1 (invalid), ""STARK"" has T and S in 1 (invalid).

Another option: ""SNAIL"" – but L is forbidden.
""SHARK"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SCARF"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SWAIN"" – A in 3 (invalid).

""SAMBA"" – A in 3 (invalid).
""SUGAR"" – A in 4 (valid), S in 1 (invalid).
""RASPY"" – A in 2 (valid), S in 3 (valid), no forbidden letters.

RASPY seems valid:
- R A S P Y
- A in 2 (not 3), S in 3 (not 1), no L/T/E.

But let me check BASIN first: B A S I N – positions are (1)B, (2)A, (3)S, (4)I, (5)N. A is in 2, S in 3 – both avoid forbidden positions.

Both RASPY and BASIN seem valid. I'll go with BASIN as it introduces new consonants (B, N) and the vowel I.

<guess>BASIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BASIN -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

Round 2 (BASIN):
- B(-) → B is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in BASIN it was in position 2 and still “-”).
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

Summary of known facts so far:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: S, A, B (each shows “-” in feedback).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, T, E, I, N.
3. Positions ruled out for each of those known letters:
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (since it got “-” when it was in both 3 and 2).
   - B cannot be in position 1.

4. Allowed positions for each known letter:
   - S: positions 2, 4, or 5.
   - A: positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - B: positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. Need a 5-letter word that contains S, A, B exactly once each, avoids the forbidden letters (L, T, E, I, N), and respects the positional exclusions above.

Let’s list candidate letters:
- Vowels allowed: A (already must appear), and possibly O, U (since E and I are out).
- Consonants allowed: S, B (must appear), plus any from {C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z}. Lower-case common ones: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, W.

We need:
- Exactly one S, one A, one B.
- Two additional letters from the allowed set.

Let’s brainstorm words:

1. SCRAB → fits: S, C, R, A, B. Check positions:
   - S (position 1) → forbidden. Reject.
2. CRABS → letters C, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
3. BARBS → has two B’s → reject (only one B allowed).
4. SABER → contains E → reject.
5. BARDS → letters B, A, R, D, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 2) → forbidden. Reject.
6. SABLE → contains E → reject.
7. SCABS → letters S, C, A, B, S → two S’s → reject.
8. DRABS → letters D, R, A, B, S. Check positions:
   - A (pos 3) → forbidden. Reject.
9. BRASH → contains H (allowed), letters B, R, A, S, H. Check positions:
   - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
10. BARFS → letters B, A, R, F, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
11. CRAGS → lacks A. Reject.
12. ACRID → contains I → reject.
13. BOARS → letters B, O, A, R, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 1) → forbidden. Reject.
14. ARSON → contains N → reject.
15. COBAS → letters C, O, B, A, S. Check positions:
    - B (pos 3) → allowed.
    - A (pos 4) → allowed.
    - S (pos 5) → allowed.
    - No forbidden letters.
    - Valid.

COBAS fits all constraints so far. (It’s a plural of “coba,” an acceptable 5-letter form in English according to word lists.)

Let’s confirm:
- Contains S, A, B each once.
- Does not contain L, T, E, I, N.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- B is in position 3 (allowed).

Therefore, COBAS is a valid next guess.

<guess>COBAS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BASIN -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: COBAS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) B(-) A(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on COBAS:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- B(-) → B is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So, we now KNOW:
- S is fixed in position 5.
- B must be somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3 or 5).
- A must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are now excluded for A).

We need a 5-letter word ending with S, with B in 2 or 4, and A in 1 or 2, and avoiding all the letters we know are out: L, T, E, I, N, C, O.

Valid letters left include: A, B, S (already placed), plus D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. We still need two more letters from these.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- Since S is fixed at position 5, the word ends with S.
- Case 1: A in position 1 and B in position 2 → A B _ _ S.
  - We need two more letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set, not repeating A, B, or S, and avoiding banned letters.
  - Possible fills: A B D ? S (but must be 5 letters). Examples: A B D (needs two more letters). Let’s think of real words: ABRUP (not a word), ABRYS (not a word), ABFMS (nonsense). ABRIS – ""abris"" is a word (plural of abri), but I is forbidden. ABRAS – contains A twice (invalid). ABRDS – not a word. So no valid word here.

- Case 2: A in position 1 and B in position 4 → A _ _ B S.
  - A _ _ B S. Need two letters in positions 2 and 3.
  - Allowed letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, Y, Z.
  - Examples:
    - A D R B S – ""adrbs"" not a word.
    - A F R B S – ""afrbs"" not a word.
    - A R M B S – ""armbs"" not a word.
    - A M B B S – two B’s (invalid).
    - A U G B S – ""augbs"" not a word.
    - A R G B S – ""argbs"" not a word.
    - A R K B S – ""arkbs"" not a word.
    - A D U B S – ""adubs"" not a word.
    - A R U B S – ""arubs"" close to ""arums"" but invalid.
    This seems unlikely.

- Case 3: A in position 2 and B in position 4 → _ A _ B S.
  - _ A _ B S. Need two letters in positions 1 and 3.
  - Position 1 can be any allowed letter except A, B, S.
  - Position 3 can be any allowed letter except A, B, S.
  - Examples:
    - D A R B S – ""darbs"" is a slang word for dollars (valid).
    - F A R B S – ""farbs"" is a reenactment term (valid).
    - H A R B S – ""harbs"" not standard.
    - G A R B S – ""garbs"" is valid (past tense of garb, or plural noun).
    - M A R B S – ""marbs"" not standard.
    - K A R B S – ""karbs"" not standard.
    - R A G B S – ""ragbs"" not standard.
    - R A D B S – ""radbs"" not standard.
    - D A G B S – ""dagbs"" not standard.
    The most common and valid are ""darbs"", ""farbs"", ""garbs"".

Let’s pick ""garbs"" since G and R are common and it’s well-known.

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (✓).
- B in position 4 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters L,T,E,I,N,C,O.

- ABBAS – repeats B (invalid) and double A (invalid).
- ABFAR – not a word.
- ABDYS – not standard.
- ABBYS – not standard.
- ABWAS – not standard.
- ABMPS – not standard.
- ABYSS – fits all rules: letters A, B, Y, S, S (only S repeats, which is fine because S is already known and correctly placed at 5, and Y is allowed).

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (✓).
- A in position 1 (✓).
- B in position 2 (✓).
- Contains only allowed letters (Y is allowed; no forbidden letters).",Guess 5: ABYSS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) Y(✓) S(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
