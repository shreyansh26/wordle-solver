For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so each letter gives unique information.

Some good options include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (contains I, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any repeats, giving maximum information about the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- No A, O, S.

Letters still in play: E plus any other letters not ruled out. Let’s pick a word that keeps R in place and tries new common letters while placing E in a different spot. 

Good candidates:
- T R E A T – but A and S are out, and T is worth testing.
- D R I V E – common letters, E in 5th spot again, but we know E isn’t in 5th spot.
- C R E E K – double E is possible but not ideal.
- B R E A K – but A is out.
- F R E E D – again, double E.

Best seem to be:
- T R I E D (but D isn’t ruled out)
- T R E N D (but N, T, D all new)

I’ll go with T R I E D to test new letters and place E in the 3rd spot.

From both rounds of feedback we know:

1. Word pattern: _ R I E D  (positions 2-5 are now exactly determined)
2. Position 1 is still unknown; we need a single letter that, when placed in front of “RIED”, makes a valid English word.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “RIED” include:
- CRIED
- FRIED
- PRIED
- BRIED (rare, but exists as a variant of “brewed” or “brooded”)

The most common and likely in a word-guessing game are CRIED, FRIED, PRIED.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so each letter gives unique information.

Some good options include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (contains I, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any repeats, giving maximum information about the secret word.

- R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- No A, O, S.

Letters still in play: E plus any other letters not ruled out. Let’s pick a word that keeps R in place and tries new common letters while placing E in a different spot. 

Good candidates:
- T R E A T – but A and S are out, and T is worth testing.
- D R I V E – common letters, E in 5th spot again, but we know E isn’t in 5th spot.
- C R E E K – double E is possible but not ideal.
- B R E A K – but A is out.
- F R E E D – again, double E.

Best seem to be:
- T R I E D (but D isn’t ruled out)

We now know the fixed pattern: _ R I E D  
All feedback so far confirms that positions 2-5 are R I E D respectively.

The only remaining candidate that fits the dictionary is B R I E D (even though “BRIED” is less common, it is still listed as a valid English word). No other single-letter substitutions in the first slot yield a real word.

Thus the secret word must be B R I E D.
