For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chances of getting feedback that will help narrow down future possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains four of the top five most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word and getting valuable feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A, R, E are not in the word at all (✗).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (it is somewhere else: 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (it is somewhere else: 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Next guess should:
1. Re-use O and S, but place them in different positions.
2. Use new common letters not yet tried (since A, R, E are ruled out).

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E are out and O is already confirmed).

A word that fits: “stoop” – but it has a double O, which is less likely.  
Another: “sound” – uses S, O, plus N, U, D.  
Check if S or O will be in new positions: S not in 4, O not in 3.  
“sound” has S in 1, O in 2 – both valid placements.

This maximizes info by testing U, N, D while re-using known letters.

We now know:

1. S is first letter (position 1) – ✓
2. O is second letter (position 2) – ✓
3. D is fifth letter (position 5) – ✓
4. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N

So the pattern so far is:  
S O _ _ D

Still possible letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more consonants or vowels that fit in positions 3 and 4.

Looking for common English consonants that haven’t been used yet, and considering valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern “SO _ _ D”.

Possible candidates:
- SOLID – but L is in position 3, I in 4. Check if L and I are still allowed – they are.
- SONID – but N is already ruled out.
- SOPED – E is ruled out, so this is invalid.
- SOUND – already tried.
- SOGGY – G is allowed, but G appears twice and Y is allowed. However, this might not be the best choice.
- SOLID seems to be the most straightforward common word that fits.

So let’s try SOLID.

Check positions:
- S (pos 1) – matches ✓
- O (pos 2) – matches ✓
- L (pos 3) – new
- I (pos 4) – new
- D (pos 5) – matches ✓
