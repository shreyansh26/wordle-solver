Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback to guide me, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help maximize information gained. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. 

A good first guess would be something like ""SLATE"" which contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of several key letters in good positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x): L is NOT in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x): T is NOT in the word at all.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: S (not 1st), A (not 3rd)

Good letters to include next: S, A
Bad letters to avoid: L, T, E

Since we know S and A are present, but not their correct positions, we should try to place them differently. Also, we should introduce new common letters not yet tried (like R, O, I, N, etc.).

A good strategy is to place S in a different position (maybe 2nd or 3rd) and A in a different position (maybe 1st or 4th), while testing new letters.

Let's consolidate what we've learned.

Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, O  
Letters definitely IN the word but whose positions we still have to work out:  
- S (cannot be in positions 1 or 3)  
- A (cannot be in positions 1 or 3)  
- N (cannot be in position 5)

Positions tried / ruled out so far:
S: ruled out of 1,3  
A: ruled out of 1,3  
N: ruled out of 5

So far we have only confirmed the letters S, A, N are somewhere in the word. We need to test more consonants and a possible vowel. Common unused letters at this point: I, C, D, U, Y, M, etc.

A good idea is a word that:
- Keeps S, A, N but moves them to new, still-possible spots  
- Introduces one or two new high-frequency letters (I, C, D)

Candidate: SANDY  
- S in position 1 (still possible from feedback, since only position 1 and 3 were ruled out for S)  
- A in position 2 (never tried; only positions 1 & 3 ruled out)  
- N in position 3 (position 5 was ruled out for N, but 3 is untested)  
- D and Y are new letters of high frequency.

Current confirmed positions:
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are unknown:
- S (must be in positions 2, 4, or 5; but positions 2 and 5 are already taken by A and Y respectively → therefore S must be in position 4)

Letters NOT in the word: L, T, E, R, O, D

So far we have:
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

We need a letter for position 1 that hasn't been used yet. Common remaining letters: C, I, U, M, B, etc.

Candidate words:
- CANSY (invalid, ""CANSY"" not a word)
- BANSY (invalid)
- MANSY (invalid)
- UANSY (invalid)
- VANSY (invalid)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- CANSY isn't valid, but CANS is a 4-letter word. Maybe ""CANSY"" isn't recognized.
- ""CANSY"" isn't in standard dictionaries, so let's think of valid words with A N S Y in positions 2-5.

Actually, the structure is: _ A N S Y

Valid 5-letter words ending in ANSY:
- FANCY (but C was ruled out)
- HANSA (doesn't fit)
- MANLY (but L is out)
- PANSY - this fits! P, A, N, S, Y.

P hasn't been used yet, and PANSY is a valid word.

Let's confirm:
- P: new letter, not tested
- A: confirmed in position 2
- N: confirmed in position 3
- S: must be in position 4 (as deduced)
- Y: confirmed in position 5

This should give us all correct letters in correct positions.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is fixed in position 2
- N is fixed in position 3
- Y is fixed in position 5
- S must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1, 2, 3, or 5)
- We need a new letter for position 1

The only valid word fitting _ A N S Y is PANSY.
