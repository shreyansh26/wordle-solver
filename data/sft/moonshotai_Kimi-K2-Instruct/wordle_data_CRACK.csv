For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. Research shows that the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. Classic first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which common letters are in the word and their potential positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2, and it does not contain I, S, or E.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- has R and A
- positions the R somewhere other than first
- positions the A somewhere other than second
- avoids I, S, E entirely

Common letters still worth testing: T, O, N, L, C, D, U, P, M, Y…  
I’ll look for a word with R, A, and a few of those remaining high-frequency letters, all in new positions.

A solid candidate is “RATIO”, but it contains I and O.  
Another is “CRANE”, but it re-uses E and N isn’t blocked, yet we already know E is out.

Let’s try “ROAST” — it uses R and A, avoids I/S/E:
- R is in position 1 (old feedback says R can’t be 1) → invalid.

Next try “TRAMP” — uses R and A:
- R in position 2 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), letters T, M, P are new.
- No I/S/E → good.

I’ll go with “TRAMP”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Classic first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which common letters are in the word and their potential positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2, and it does not contain I, S, or E.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- has R and A
- positions the R somewhere other than first
- positions the A somewhere other than second
- avoids I, S, E entirely

Common letters still worth testing: T, O, N, L, C, D, U, P, M, Y…  
I’ll look for a word with R, A, and a few of those remaining high-frequency letters, all in new positions.

A solid candidate is “RATIO”, but it contains I and O.  
Another is “CRANE”, but it re-uses E and N isn’t blocked, yet we already know E is out.

Let’s try “ROAST” — it uses R and A, avoids I/S/E:
- R is in position 1 (old feedback says R can’t be 1) → invalid.

Next try “TRAMP” — uses R and A:
- R in position 2 (allowed), A in position 3 (allowed), letters T, M, P are new.
- No I/S/E → good.

I’ll go with “TRAMP”.

So the fixed pattern so far is:
_ R A _ _

Remaining constraints:
- Letters already eliminated: I, S, E, T, M, P
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- R and A are locked in positions 2 and 3.

I need a word that fits _ R A _ _ and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- CRACK → uses C (allowed) but repeats C (not forbidden yet) and ends in CK (possible)
- GRASP → S is eliminated
- BRAND → ends in ND (both allowed)
- DRANK → ends in NK, N and K allowed
- FRAIL → I is eliminated
- ORANG → G allowed, ends in NG
- TRASH → T and S eliminated
- GRATE → T and E eliminated

Among these, “BRAND” and “DRANK” are both strong because they introduce two new common consonants each.

I’ll go with DRANK because N and K are both high-frequency remaining letters.

- GRATE → T and E eliminated

Among these, “BRAND” and “DRANK” are both strong because they introduce two new common consonants each.

I’ll go with DRANK because N and K are both high-frequency remaining letters.

Pattern check: D R A N K → follows _ R A _ _ and uses no eliminated letters.

1. Position constraints:
   - Position 2 = R (✓)
   - Position 3 = A (✓)
   - Position 5 = K (✓)

   So the pattern is: _ R A _ K

2. Eliminated letters (must not appear anywhere):
   I, S, E, T, M, P, D, N

3. Remaining alphabet pool for positions 1 and 4 (in order of commonness):
   B, C, F, G, H, L, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need 5-letter English words that fit “_ R A _ K” and use only letters not in the banned set.

Possible candidates:
- B R A C K  → uses C (allowed) and B (allowed) – all letters OK
- C R A C K  → repeats C, but C is allowed
- B R A V K  → not a valid word
- F R A C K  → “frack” is valid
- G R A C K  → “grack” is not a word
- H R A C K  → “hrack” is not a word
- B R A G K  → “bragk” is not a word
- B R A N K  → N is eliminated
- C R A B K  → “crabk” is not a word

The two clear valid choices are BRACK and FRACK, but “brack” is the more common English word (e.g., “brackish”). I will choose BRACK.

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already banned: I, S, E, T, M, P, D, N, B.

Remaining possible first letters (common ones first): F, G, H, L, O, U, V, W, Y.

Valid words beginning with one of these letters and fitting _ R A C K:

- FRACK – but “frack” is slang and less common.
- GRACK – not a recognized word.
- TRACK – T is banned.
- WRACK – “wrack” is valid.

Between FRACK and WRACK, “wrack” is the standard English word (“wrack and ruin”), and W has not been eliminated.

Therefore, the secret word must be WRACK.

We now have the pattern _ R A C K and have discovered that every common consonant we try in the first position (B, W, etc.) is rejected. The only remaining letters for the first position that have not been eliminated are F, G, H, L, O, U, V, Y.

Among these, the only valid English word fitting _ R A C K is:

- CRACK → C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, C in 4, K in 5.  
  But we already know C is in position 4 (✓), so C cannot also be in position 1 (would contradict single-letter usage unless the word has two Cs). However, ""CRACK"" is a real word.

The feedback on BRACK (C in position 4 ✓) does not forbid C from appearing elsewhere, so ""CRACK"" is still possible. No other common word fits (e.g., FRACK is slang, GRACK invalid, etc.).

Thus, the secret word must be CRACK.
