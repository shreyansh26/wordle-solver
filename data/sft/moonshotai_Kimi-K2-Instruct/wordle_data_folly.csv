For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:

- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these important letters are in the word and their possible positions.

So far we know:

- R, A, I, S, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked with ""x"").

Since all five letters in ""RAISE"" were rejected, we need a completely fresh set of letters.  
A good next-guess strategy is to pick a word that uses:

- A different set of high-frequency letters that weren’t in RAISE.
- At least two vowels (to test vowel positions quickly).
- Common consonants often found in 5-letter words.

Looking at common English letters not including R, A, I, S, E, the remaining high-frequency letters include T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word with two vowels and three new consonants is ""MOUNT"".  
It tests: M, O, U, N, T — none of which appeared in the first guess.

If none of these letters appears, we will have eliminated a big chunk of possible words and can further refine.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Only the letter O is confirmed to be in the word.  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUNT) we have O in the correct position: _ O _ _ _
   - From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we also see that O was marked “-”, which means it is in the word but in the wrong position in BLOCK.  
   However, that conflicts with the earlier “✓” in MOUNT, so we have to trust the strongest information: in MOUNT, O was in position 2 and got ✓, so O MUST be in position 2. The “-” in BLOCK is therefore impossible because position 2 already tells us O is at position 2 and cannot be elsewhere.  
   Therefore we can disregard the “-” for O in BLOCK as a mis-read; the only reliable info is that O is in position 2.

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K

3. Therefore the second letter is O. The remaining letters to test are from:
   D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

4. From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we got L(-), so L is in the word but not in position 3.

5. Therefore we have:
   _ O _ _ _
   L must appear in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.

6. We now need a common word that:
   - has O in position 2,
   - contains L in one of positions 1, 4, or 5,
   - uses only letters not yet ruled out.

7. Candidate letters left: D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

8. Let’s form a plausible word that fits:
   - L O _ _ _ → but L is confirmed not in position 1, so L must be in 4 or 5.
   - _ O _ _ L → a common word is “HOTEL” but T and E are ruled out.
   - _ O _ L _ → a simple word is “FOGEL” but F and G are still possible, and E and T are out.  Wait, E is out.  Try “FOLLY” – L is in position 4, Y is allowed, but Y is rare.
   - “LODGE” – but D and G are allowed, E is out.
   - “LODGY” – uncommon.
   - “LOOPY” – P and Y are allowed, but two P’s?  “LOOPY” seems okay.
   - “LOWLY” – W and Y are allowed.
   - “HOLLY” – H and L and Y are allowed.

9. Among these, “HOLLY” is a common English word:
   - H not tested yet.
   - O in position 2 – perfect.
   - L in position 3 is ruled out by the “-” feedback (L in BLOCK was position 3 marked “-”), so L cannot be in position 3.  In “HOLLY” L appears in positions 3 and 4 – that would violate the “-”.  So skip HOLLY.

10. Try “LOWLY”: positions are L O W L Y.  L is in position 1 and 4.  Position 1 is okay, position 4 is okay, and position 3 is W.  O is in position 2 – good.  All letters (O, L, W, Y) are still allowed.  This seems valid.

11. Another candidate: FOCAL – but C and A are out.

12. Another candidate: GOLLY – G, O, L, L, Y.  L appears twice, once in position 3 (disallowed) and once in 4.  So that is problematic.

13. Therefore “LOWLY” is the safest choice that satisfies all constraints.

<guess>LOWLY</guess>",LOWLY,"Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Only the letter O is confirmed to be in the word.  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUNT) we have O in the correct position: _ O _ _ _
   - From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we also see that O was marked “-”, which means it is in the word but in the wrong position in BLOCK.  
   However, that conflicts with the earlier “✓” in MOUNT, so we have to trust the strongest information: in MOUNT, O was in position 2 and got ✓, so O MUST be in position 2. The “-” in BLOCK is therefore impossible because position 2 already tells us O is at position 2 and cannot be elsewhere.  
   Therefore we can disregard the “-” for O in BLOCK as a mis-read; the only reliable info is that O is in position 2.

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K

3. Therefore the second letter is O. The remaining letters to test are from:
   D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

4. From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we got L(-), so L is in the word but not in position 3.

5. Therefore we have:
   _ O _ _ _
   L must appear in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.

6. We now need a common word that:
   - has O in position 2,
   - contains L in one of positions 1, 4, or 5,
   - uses only letters not yet ruled out.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:

- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these important letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- R, A, I, S, E are **not** in the secret word (all marked with ""x"").

Since all five letters in ""RAISE"" were rejected, we need a completely fresh set of letters.  
A good next-guess strategy is to pick a word that uses:

- A different set of high-frequency letters that weren’t in RAISE.
- At least two vowels (to test vowel positions quickly).
- Common consonants often found in 5-letter words.

Looking at common English letters not including R, A, I, S, E, the remaining high-frequency letters include T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word with two vowels and three new consonants is ""MOUNT"".  
It tests: M, O, U, N, T — none of which appeared in the first guess.

If none of these letters appears, we will have eliminated a big chunk of possible words and can further refine.

Remaining high-value consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none left except O (A, I, E, U already out)

I still want to test several new consonants quickly and keep the word common.  
A good candidate is “BLOCK”:

- B, L, C, K are all new letters not tested yet.
- O is confirmed in position 2, and BLOCK places it there.
- K is a frequent ending letter for 5-letter words.

This guess will tell me immediately which of B, L, C, K are present and where.

Looking at common English letters not including R, A, I, S, E, the remaining high-frequency letters include T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word with two vowels and three new consonants is ""MOUNT"".  
It tests: M, O, U, N, T — none of which appeared in the first guess.

If none of these letters appears, we will have eliminated a big chunk of possible words and can further refine.

- Letters completely ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T  
- Letter known to be in the word: O (and it is in position 2)

So the secret word is of the form _ O _ _ _ and the other four letters come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 ruled-out letters).

Remaining high-value consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none left except O (A, I, E, U already out)

I still want to test several new consonants quickly and keep the word common.  
A good candidate is “BLOCK”:

- B, L, C, K are all new letters not tested yet.
- O is confirmed in position 2, and BLOCK places it there.
- K is a frequent ending letter for 5-letter words.

This guess will tell me immediately which of B, L, C, K are present and where.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Only the letter O is confirmed to be in the word.  
   - From Guess 2 (MOUNT) we have O in the correct position: _ O _ _ _
   - From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we also see that O was marked “-”, which means it is in the word but in the wrong position in BLOCK.  
   However, that conflicts with the earlier “✓” in MOUNT, so we have to trust the strongest information: in MOUNT, O was in position 2 and got ✓, so O MUST be in position 2. The “-” in BLOCK is therefore impossible because position 2 already tells us O is at position 2 and cannot be elsewhere.  
   Therefore we can disregard the “-” for O in BLOCK as a mis-read; the only reliable info is that O is in position 2.

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K

3. Therefore the second letter is O. The remaining letters to test are from:
   D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

4. From Guess 3 (BLOCK) we got L(-), so L is in the word but not in position 3.

5. Therefore we have:
   _ O _ _ _
   L must appear in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.

6. We now need a common word that:
   - has O in position 2,
   - contains L in one of positions 1, 4, or 5,
   - uses only letters not yet ruled out.

7. Candidate letters left: D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

8. Let’s form a plausible word that fits:
   - L O _ _ _ → but L is confirmed not in position 1, so L must be in 4 or 5.
   - _ O _ _ L → a common word is “HOTEL” but T and E are ruled out.
   - _ O _ L _ → a simple word is “FOGEL” but F and G are still possible, and E and T are out.  Wait, E is out.  Try “FOLLY” – L is in position 4, Y is allowed, but Y is rare.
   - “LODGE” – but D and G are allowed, E is out.
   - “LODGY” – uncommon.
   - “LOOPY” – P and Y are allowed, but two P’s?  “LOOPY” seems okay.
   - “LOWLY” – W and Y are allowed.
   - “HOLLY” – H and L and Y are allowed.

9. Among these, “HOLLY” is a common English word:
   - H not tested yet.
   - O in position 2 – perfect.
   - L in position 3 is ruled out by the “-” feedback (L in BLOCK was position 3 marked “-”), so L cannot be in position 3.  In “HOLLY” L appears in positions 3 and 4 – that would violate the “-”.  So skip HOLLY.

10. Try “LOWLY”: positions are L O W L Y.  L is in position 1 and 4.  Position 1 is okay, position 4 is okay, and position 3 is W.  O is in position 2 – good.  All letters (O, L, W, Y) are still allowed.  This seems valid.

11. Another candidate: FOCAL – but C and A are out.

12. Another candidate: GOLLY – G, O, L, L, Y.  L appears twice, once in position 3 (disallowed) and once in 4.  So that is problematic.

13. Therefore “LOWLY” is the safest choice that satisfies all constraints.

- Position 2: O (✓) — confirmed again
- L appears twice:
    – First L (position 1) was marked “-” ⇒ L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
    – Second L (position 4) was marked “✓” ⇒ L is in position 4.
- W (x) and Y (✓) 
    – W is ruled out.
    – Y is in position 5.

So the word pattern is fixed:
? O ? L Y
with L also not in position 1 (already satisfied since L is in 4).

Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K, W.

Letters still possible: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Z (plus any others not listed).

We need a common 5-letter word fitting _ O _ L Y.

Common words:
- FOOLY – but “FOOLY” is not a standard word.
- COOLY – C is out.
- DOOLY – rare.
- HOOLY – rare/old.
- GOOLY – not standard.
- POOLY – not standard.
- JOLLY – J is still allowed. “JOLLY” = J O L L Y.  Position 3 would be L, but L is already in position 4, so two L’s is acceptable.  Let’s check:
    – Letters: J, O, L, L, Y.  All letters are allowed.
    – Pattern: _ O _ L Y → J O L L Y matches.
    – All missing letters (J, second L) are allowed.

“JOLLY” seems the only common word that fits.  Let’s guess it.
