For the first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, E
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S
- Need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E but not O, S, and the A, R, E cannot be in their original positions (1,2,5 respectively).

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1st → can be 2,3,4,5, but since R is also in word and cannot be 2nd, we need to rearrange.
- R cannot be 2nd → can be 1,3,4,5.
- E cannot be 5th → can be 1,2,3,4.

A good candidate word that uses these letters in new positions is ""EARLY"":
- Contains E, A, R (and new letters L, Y to test).
- Positions: E(1), A(2), R(3) — none are in their original AROSE positions.
- Does not contain O or S.

This tests new positions for the known letters and introduces new letters for elimination.

   - A is not in position 2.
   - R is not in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word using A, R, E, L plus one more letter (not O, S, Y). A common consonant to try is T. Also, since we have 4 known letters, we need to find a word that uses all of them. A possible candidate is ""ALTER"":
