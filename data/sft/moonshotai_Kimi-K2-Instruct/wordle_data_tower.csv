2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should use common letters in frequently occurring positions, and ideally cover all five vowels if possible, or at least several common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequencies in English:
- E is the most common letter
- Other common letters include A, T, O, I, N, S, H, R

A strong starting word would include these common letters. Some popular choices among players include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and includes three vowels (A, E) plus two very common consonants (C, R, N).

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Known so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N
- Letters that ARE in the word, but positions still unknown: R, E
- We also know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

To maximize the information from the second guess, I should:
1. Keep R and E somewhere in the word (since they must appear).
2. Avoid C, A, and N.
3. Try new common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Good candidates that contain both R and E while avoiding C,A,N and respecting the position restrictions:
- TREND (but D is less common, and N is excluded)
- STERE (repeats E, gives less info)
- GREAT (contains A which is excluded)
- BREAD (A excluded)
- FRESH (contains E,R; other letters are common)
- PERCH (contains E,R; H is common)
- WORDS like: TIGER, FEVER, MERIT, etc.

I’ll choose ""TIGER"" because:
- It keeps E and R (both must appear somewhere).
- E is in position 3 (allowed since E isn’t at 5).
- R is in position 5 (allowed since R wasn’t at 2).
- Introduces T, I, G – three new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids C, A, N entirely.

Common unused consonants: S, L, D, B, M, F, H, Y …  
Common unused vowels: O, U … but E is already used.
