For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in strategic positions. A good starting word should include several vowels and common consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Popular first guesses include:
- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (uses 4 vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants with good vowel placement)
- CRANE (well-balanced with common letters)
- RAISE (good mix of common letters)

I'll choose SLATE because:
1. S is very common as both first and last letter
2. L is a high-frequency consonant
3. A and E are the most common vowels
4. T is extremely common in English words
5. The placement covers different positions (S at start, E at end)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in different positions to maximize feedback information.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S (1st letter) and T (4th letter) are NOT in the word (x).
- L (2nd letter) is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓ at position 2).
- A (3rd letter) is in the word but not in that spot (-).
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- A is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- No S or T or E anywhere.
- L is locked at position 2.

I need a word that:
1. Has L in position 2.
2. Has A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
3. Uses letters that have not been eliminated (no S, T, E).

Good consonants to try next: R, N, M, C, B, D, F, G, H, K, P, etc.
Good vowels left: A, I, O, U (but we know A is in the word).

Possible patterns:
- A L _ A _ (but A can't be in position 3 and already can't be in position 5 due to E elimination)
- _ L A _ _
- _ L _ A _
- _ L _ _ A

Considering common words fitting _ L _ _ _ with A somewhere:

Let's try ""FLANK"":
- F: common consonant
- L: correctly placed
- A: fits position 3 (though feedback said A is wrong position, but position 3 was marked -, so A could be here... Wait no, position 3 was marked - for A, so A cannot be in position 3. Need to place A elsewhere.

Alternative: ""CLAMP"":
- C, L, A, M, P
- A is in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this violates that.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, A, N, D
- A is in position 3 - violates feedback.

""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - violates.

""BLAND"":
- B, L, A, N, D
- A is in position 3 - violates.

Alternative approach: Put A in position 1 or 4 or 5.

""ALARM"":
- A, L, A, R, M
- But A is in position 1 and 3 - position 3 is invalid.

""FLARN"":
- Not a valid word.

""ALONG"":
- A, L, O, N, G
- A in position 1: allowed
- No S, T, E
- Uses new letters O, N, G

""ALONE"":
- Contains E which is eliminated.

""ALLOY"":
- Y isn't great for information.

""ALLOW"":
- W is okay, but not optimal.

""BLAZE"":
- Z and E (E is eliminated).

""CLACK"":
- Double C and K.

After reconsidering, ""FLANK"" is invalid because A would be in position 3. Next best is ""CLANG"":
- C, L, A, N, G
- A in position 3 is invalid per feedback.

Wait, feedback said A is in word but not in position 3. So A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Best is probably ""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - but this violates feedback.

I made an error - A cannot be in position 3. Let me choose a word where A is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Good option: ""CLASP"" - but has S which is eliminated.

""BLANK"":
- B, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

""ALARM"":
- A, L, A, R, M - A in position 3 is invalid.

""ALAND"":
- A, L, A, N, D - A in position 3 is invalid.

""FLANK"" is invalid due to A position.

Let me try ""GLAND"" - but A is in position 3.

Realizing my mistake - I need A in position 1, 4, or 5.

- Doesn't violate any known constraints

""ALONG"" seems to be the best next guess given constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in strategic positions. A good starting word should include several vowels and common consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Popular first guesses include:
- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (uses 4 vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants with good vowel placement)
- CRANE (well-balanced with common letters)
- RAISE (good mix of common letters)

I'll choose SLATE because:
1. S is very common as both first and last letter
2. L is a high-frequency consonant
3. A and E are the most common vowels
4. T is extremely common in English words
5. The placement covers different positions (S at start, E at end)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in different positions to maximize feedback information.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S (1st letter) and T (4th letter) are NOT in the word (x).
- L (2nd letter) is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓ at position 2).
- A (3rd letter) is in the word but not in that spot (-).
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ L _ _ _
- A is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- No S or T or E anywhere.
- L is locked at position 2.

I need a word that:
1. Has L in position 2.
2. Has A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
3. Uses letters that have not been eliminated (no S, T, E).

Good consonants to try next: R, N, M, C, B, D, F, G, H, K, P, etc.
Good vowels left: A, I, O, U (but we know A is in the word).

Possible patterns:
- A L _ A _ (but A can't be in position 3 and already can't be in position 5 due to E elimination)
- _ L A _ _
- _ L _ A _
- _ L _ _ A

Considering common words fitting _ L _ _ _ with A somewhere:

Let's try ""FLANK"":
- F: common consonant
- L: correctly placed
- A: fits position 3 (though feedback said A is wrong position, but position 3 was marked -, so A could be here... Wait no, position 3 was marked - for A, so A cannot be in position 3. Need to place A elsewhere.

Alternative: ""CLAMP"":
- C, L, A, M, P
- A is in position 3 - but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this violates that.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, A, N, D
- A is in position 3 - violates feedback.

""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - violates.

""BLAND"":
- B, L, A, N, D
- A is in position 3 - violates.

Alternative approach: Put A in position 1 or 4 or 5.

""ALARM"":
- A, L, A, R, M
- But A is in position 1 and 3 - position 3 is invalid.

""FLARN"":
- Not a valid word.

""ALONG"":
- A, L, O, N, G
- A in position 1: allowed
- No S, T, E
- Uses new letters O, N, G

""ALONE"":
- Contains E which is eliminated.

""ALLOY"":
- Y isn't great for information.

""ALLOW"":
- W is okay, but not optimal.

""BLAZE"":
- Z and E (E is eliminated).

""CLACK"":
- Double C and K.

After reconsidering, ""FLANK"" is invalid because A would be in position 3. Next best is ""CLANG"":
- C, L, A, N, G
- A in position 3 is invalid per feedback.

Wait, feedback said A is in word but not in position 3. So A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Best is probably ""PLANK"":
- P, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - but this violates feedback.

I made an error - A cannot be in position 3. Let me choose a word where A is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Good option: ""CLASP"" - but has S which is eliminated.

""BLANK"":
- B, L, A, N, K
- A is in position 3 - invalid.

""ALARM"":
- A, L, A, R, M - A in position 3 is invalid.

""ALAND"":
- A, L, A, N, D - A in position 3 is invalid.

""FLANK"" is invalid due to A position.

Let me try ""GLAND"" - but A is in position 3.

Realizing my mistake - I need A in position 1, 4, or 5.

""PLANE"":
- Contains E (eliminated).

""PLAIN"":
- P, L, A, I, N
- A in position 3 is invalid.

""PLANK"":
- Same issue.

""FLANK"":
- Same issue.

Alternative: ""CLANG"":
- C, L, A, N, G
- A in position 3 is invalid.

This is tricky. Let me try ""ALONG"":
- A in position 1: valid
- L in position 2: correct
- O, N, G are new letters
- Doesn't violate any known constraints

""ALONG"" seems to be the best next guess given constraints.Based on the feedback that L is in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, and S, T, E are eliminated, I'll try a word that places A in position 1 and introduces new consonants.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern: _ L O _ _  (positions 2 and 3 fixed as L and O)
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from ALONG & CLOAK feedback).  
   Therefore A must be the 5th letter: _ L O _ A
3. Forbidden letters so far: S, T, E, N, G, C, K (all given x marks).
4. Letters already confirmed not in the word: any of the above.
5. Still-available common letters: R, D, B, F, H, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

So the hidden word has the exact pattern: ? L O ? A  
with the two blanks chosen only from the still-allowed consonants.

List 5-letter English words that fit _ L O _ A and use none of the forbidden letters:

BLOBA – invalid (not a word)  
BLOMA – invalid  
FLOTA – has T (forbidden)  
BLOWA – invalid  
BROMA – invalid  
DROPA – invalid  
BLODA – invalid  
FLOBA – invalid  
PLOMA – invalid  
BLOPA – invalid  
BRODA – invalid  
BLOHA – invalid  
BLOPA – invalid  
BLOFA – invalid  
BLOIA – invalid  
BLOUA – invalid  
BLOVA – invalid  
BLOYA – invalid  

The only real word fitting the pattern and constraints is:

B L O W A → but that's 5 letters and invalid (not a real word)

Actually, let me recheck:

F L O R A – F, L, O, R, A  
- R is allowed, F is allowed.  
- Fits _ L O _ A (F at 1, R at 4).  
- Contains none of the forbidden letters.

Another candidate:

B L O W A – not valid  
P L O W A – not valid  

F L O R A is the only valid 5-letter English word matching the discovered pattern and constraints.

Thus, the next logical guess is FLORA.
