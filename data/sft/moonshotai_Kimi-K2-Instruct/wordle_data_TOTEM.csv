For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S

This helps quickly identify which vowels and common consonants are present in the secret word.

Current confirmed letters and positions:
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)
- E is correct in position 4 (✓)

Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, N, Y

We have the pattern:
T O _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Allowed letters are any 5-letter English letters except the excluded ones above.

Common letters we haven't tried yet in the remaining positions: L, D, G, M, C, B, F, H, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that fit T O _ E _ with the remaining letters.

Possible options:
- TOLED (but LED is a suffix, not sure if TOLED is a word)
- TOWER (but R is excluded)
- TOILE (but I is not confirmed yet)
- TOTEM (but we haven't tried M)
- TOKEN (N is excluded)
- TOTED (D could work)
- TOMES (S is excluded)

Wait, let's think of common words:
- TOTEM - uses T, O, E, M
- TOTED - uses T, O, E, D
- TOPED - uses T, O, E, P, D
- TOPER - R is excluded
- TOXIC - X is possible
- TODAY - A is excluded
- TOILE - I is possible
- TOTEM seems like a good common word that fits.

Let me check if TOTEM is 5 letters and valid - yes, it is.

But we need to consider that position 3 and 5 letters must not be any of the excluded ones (A, R, S, N, Y).

TOTEM uses M for position 5, which hasn't been excluded. The third letter is T, but we already have T in position 1 - is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.

But wait, in TOTEM the third letter is T, which would make it T O T E M. Is this valid? Yes.

But maybe we can find a word that gives us more information about other letters.

Another option is TOXEM - but that's not a word.

TOGEM - not a word.

TOBEM - not a word.

TOHEM - not a word.

TOFEM - not a word.

TOLEM - not a word.

Actually, TOTEM seems to be the only common word I can think of fitting this pattern. The other possibilities are TOBED, TOTED, TOPED, etc. but these might be less common.

Let me try TOTED instead - T O T E D. This uses D which is a new letter.

But is TOTED a common word? It means ""carried"" - yes, it's valid.

Between TOTEM and TOTED, both fit, but TOTED introduces D which might be more common.

But looking at the pattern T O _ E _, and needing two new letters, let's think of other possibilities:

- TOKE D - but K hasn't been used, and D is new. TOKE is 4 letters, need 5.
- TOILE - T O I L E - but E is in position 4, so T O I L E would be T O I L E - that fits T O _ E _ with I and L. Is TOILE a word? It's French for fabric, but might not be acceptable in English word lists.
- TOILE is actually acceptable in English Scrabble dictionaries.

But TOILE is T O I L E - positions: T(✓), O(✓), then I, L, E - but E is supposed to be in position 4, so this would be T O I L E - E is position 5, but we know E is in position 4. So this doesn't fit because position 4 must be E.

Therefore the pattern is strictly T O _ E _ with E fixed in position 4.

So possible words:
- T O B E D
- T O C E D (not a word)
- T O D E D (not a word)
- T O F E D (not a word)
- T O G E D (not a word)

- T O R E D (R is excluded)
- T O S E D (S is excluded)
- T O T E D
- T O V E D (not a word)
- T O W E D - W is possible
- T O Y E D (Y is excluded)

From these, the valid words seem to be: TOPED, TOTED, TOWED.

Among these, TOWED is the most common word.

- T: position 1 (✓)
- O: position 2 (✓) 
- W: new letter for position 3

- Two common consonants: R, S

This helps quickly identify which vowels and common consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A: not in the word at all (x)
- R: not in the word at all (x)
- O: in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- E: in the word, but not in position 5 (-)

So we now know:
1. O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3
2. E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5
3. A, R, S are not in the word at all

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let's think of words with common letters that fit these constraints. Since we can't use A, R, or S, we might try letters like T, L, N, D, M, etc. 

One good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- T: common consonant
- O: we know this is in the word
- N: common consonant
- E: we know this is in the word
- Y: could be in the word

This would test positions for O and E while introducing new common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TONEY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed letters and positions:
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)
- E is correct in position 4 (✓)

Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, N, Y

We have the pattern:
T O _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Allowed letters are any 5-letter English letters except the excluded ones above.

Common letters we haven't tried yet in the remaining positions: L, D, G, M, C, B, F, H, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that fit T O _ E _ with the remaining letters.

Possible options:
- TOLED (but LED is a suffix, not sure if TOLED is a word)
- TOWER (but R is excluded)
- TOILE (but I is not confirmed yet)
- TOTEM (but we haven't tried M)
- TOKEN (N is excluded)
- TOTED (D could work)
- TOMES (S is excluded)

Wait, let's think of common words:
- TOTEM - uses T, O, E, M
- TOTED - uses T, O, E, D
- TOPED - uses T, O, E, P, D
- TOPER - R is excluded
- TOXIC - X is possible
- TODAY - A is excluded
- TOILE - I is possible
- TOTEM seems like a good common word that fits.

Let me check if TOTEM is 5 letters and valid - yes, it is.

But we need to consider that position 3 and 5 letters must not be any of the excluded ones (A, R, S, N, Y).

TOTEM uses M for position 5, which hasn't been excluded. The third letter is T, but we already have T in position 1 - is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.

But wait, in TOTEM the third letter is T, which would make it T O T E M. Is this valid? Yes.

But maybe we can find a word that gives us more information about other letters.

Another option is TOXEM - but that's not a word.

TOGEM - not a word.

TOBEM - not a word.

TOHEM - not a word.

TOFEM - not a word.

TOLEM - not a word.

Actually, TOTEM seems to be the only common word I can think of fitting this pattern. The other possibilities are TOBED, TOTED, TOPED, etc. but these might be less common.

Let me try TOTED instead - T O T E D. This uses D which is a new letter.

But is TOTED a common word? It means ""carried"" - yes, it's valid.

Between TOTEM and TOTED, both fit, but TOTED introduces D which might be more common.

But looking at the pattern T O _ E _, and needing two new letters, let's think of other possibilities:

- TOKE D - but K hasn't been used, and D is new. TOKE is 4 letters, need 5.
- TOILE - T O I L E - but E is in position 4, so T O I L E would be T O I L E - that fits T O _ E _ with I and L. Is TOILE a word? It's French for fabric, but might not be acceptable in English word lists.
- TOILE is actually acceptable in English Scrabble dictionaries.

But TOILE is T O I L E - positions: T(✓), O(✓), then I, L, E - but E is supposed to be in position 4, so this would be T O I L E - E is position 5, but we know E is in position 4. So this doesn't fit because position 4 must be E.

Therefore the pattern is strictly T O _ E _ with E fixed in position 4.

So possible words:
- T O B E D
- T O C E D (not a word)
- T O D E D (not a word)
- T O F E D (not a word)
- T O G E D (not a word)
- T O H E D (not a word)
- T O I E D (not a word)
- T O J E D (not a word)
- T O K E D (not a word)
- T O L E D (not a word)
- T O M E D (not a word)
- T O P E D (as in TOPED - a valid word meaning to treat with a tope)
- T O R E D (R is excluded)
- T O S E D (S is excluded)
- T O T E D
- T O V E D (not a word)
- T O W E D - W is possible
- T O Y E D (Y is excluded)

From these, the valid words seem to be: TOPED, TOTED, TOWED.

Among these, TOWED is the most common word.

Let me choose TOWED.

T O W E D:
- T: position 1 (✓)
- O: position 2 (✓) 
- W: new letter for position 3
- E: position 4 (✓)
- D: new letter for position 5

This tests W and D as new letters while keeping the confirmed ones in place.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- T is correct in the 1st position
- O is correct in the 2nd position
- E is correct in the 4th position
- Letters A, R, S, N, Y are not in the word

The word has the form: T O _ E _

We need to find letters for positions 3 and 5. A common word fitting this pattern is ""TOWED"".

Let’s look at common 5-letter words that fit T O _ E _ and use letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- T O B E L (B, L) – but “TOBEL” is not a word
- T O C E L – “TOCEL” not a word
- T O B E M – “TOBEM” not a word
- T O M E L – not a word
- T O G E T – “TOGET” not a word
- T O P E Z – “TOPEZ” not a word
- T O P E L – “TOPEL” not a word
- T O C E A – A is ruled out
- T O L E M – “TOLEM” not a word
- T O G E M – “TOGEM” not a word
- T O B E R – R is ruled out
- T O P E C – “TOPEC” not a word
- T O M E T – “TOMET” not a word
- T O L E F – “TOLEF” not a word
- T O P E N – N is ruled out
- T O P E L – “TOPEL” not a word
- T O B E T – “TOBET” not a word
- T O F E T – “TOFET” not a word
- T O C E T – “TOCET” not a word
- T O K E T – “TOKET” not a word
- T O L E T – “TOLET” is actually a valid word (British spelling of “to let”)
- T O M E T – not a word
- T O C E T – not a word
- T O P E T – “TOPET” not a word
- T O G E T – “TOGET” not a word
- T O L E T – “TOLET” is valid
- T O P E L – “TOPEL” not a word
- T O L E T – seems the best so far

Another check: “TOLET” is a valid word meaning “to hire out.” In Scrabble dictionaries it is accepted. It uses L and T – T is already known, but L is new. We know T is allowed to repeat (since it’s already in position 1).

Another candidate: “TOKER” – but R is ruled out.
“TOKEN” – N is ruled out.
“TOILE” – L and I, but E must be position 4; “TOILE” is T-O-I-L-E, where E is position 5 – invalid because E must be in position 4.

Another candidate: “TOPIC” – but C is last, pattern mismatch.

“TOPED” – already tried (D is ruled out).

“TOBIE” – I and E, but E is position 5 here – invalid.

“TOGUE” – U and E, E is position 5 – invalid.

“TOPIE” – invalid.

“TOLAN” – N ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOPET” – not a word.

“TOLET” seems to be the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses new letters (L) we haven’t tested yet.

But let me check another angle – the word family T O _ E _:

Common words:
- TOPES – S is ruled out
- TOLES – S ruled out
- TOLED – D ruled out
- TOMES – S ruled out
- TORES – R, S ruled out
- TOBES – S ruled out
- TOKES – S ruled out
- TOGES – S ruled out
- TOBIE – pattern mismatch (E must be position 4)
- TOQUE – Q and U, U is position 5, E is position 4 – fits! T-O-Q-U-E: pattern T O _ E _, E is position 4, Q-U in 3-5, but length is 5: T-O-Q-U-E – no, that would be T-O-Q-U-E – positions: T(1), O(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5) – but E must be position 4, so this is invalid.

Wait – the pattern is strictly T O _ E _ (positions 1-2-3-4-5), so positions 3 and 5 must be filled.

Valid common words:
- TO LET – “TOLET” is valid
- TO M E T – “TOMET” not a word
- TO P E T – “TOPET” not a word
- TO L E T – “TOLET” is valid
- TO C E T – “TOCET” not a word
- TO B E T – “TOBET” not a word
- TO G E T – “TOGET” not a word
- TO H E T – “TOHET” not a word
- TO K E T – “TOKET” not a word
- TO V E T – “TOVET” not a word
- TO M E T – “TOMET” not a word
- TO F E T – “TOFET” not a word
- TO J E T – “TOJET” not a word
- TO X E T – “TOXET” not a word
- TO Z E T – “TOZET” not a word
- TO L E T – seems the only valid word.

“TOLET” is valid. But I realize “TOLET” is actually more obscure. The most common English word fitting T O _ E _ is “TOKEN” but N is ruled out. Another is “TOLES” but S is ruled out. Let me think again.

“TOMES” – S ruled out.
“TOPER” – R ruled out.
“TOKER” – R ruled out.
“TOLES” – S ruled out.
“TOBIE” – pattern mismatch.

Actually, “BOTEL” is a word, but reversed.

Wait, let me try “TOKED” – but D is ruled out.

“TOBES” – S ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOBIE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOPIC” – pattern mismatch.

“TOILE” – pattern mismatch (E must be 4).

“TOKER” – R ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOBET” – not a word.

“TOGET” – not a word.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TOFET” – not a word.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TO JET” – “TOJET” not a word.

“TO KET” – “TOKET” not a word.

“TO LET” – “TOLET” is valid.

“TO MET” – “TOMET” not a word.

“TO PET” – “TOPET” not a word.

“TO RET” – R ruled out.

“TO SET” – S ruled out.

“TO TET” – “TOTET” not a word.

“TO VET” – “TOVET” not a word.

“TO WET” – W is ruled out.

“TO ZET” – not a word.

So “TOLET” is the only valid word that fits. However, it's a bit obscure. Another candidate: “TOILE” is invalid because E must be in position 4, not 5.

Let me think of another word: “TOBEL” is not a word.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words starting with TO and ending with E but E is in position 4.

TO _ E _:
- TOBEE – not a word.
- TOKEE – not a word.
- TOCEE – not a word.
- TOPHE – but H is possible, E is correct in 4, so T O P H E – but this would be T-O-P-H-E – positions 1-2-3-4-5, so E is position 5, which violates the rule that E must be in position 4.

Thus the only valid word seems to be “TOLET”.

But I recall that “TOLET” is a variant spelling of “to let,” used in British English for “to hire out,” and it’s accepted in Scrabble. It uses L and T – T is already known, but L is new.

Another candidate: “TOBIE” – but pattern mismatch.

“TOBIE” is T-O-B-I-E – E is position 5, invalid.

“TOKEE” – not a word.

“TOPEE” – but E is position 5, invalid.

“TOGEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOLEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOLLY” – Y ruled out.

“TOILE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOXIC” – pattern mismatch.

“TOQUE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOZIN” – N ruled out.

“TOXIN” – N ruled out.

“TOILE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TOLET” appears to be the only valid word. However, I think I missed “TOKED” – but D is ruled out.

Another word: “TOXEM” – not a word.

“TOGEM” – not a word.

“TOBEM” – not a word.

“TOLEM” – not a word.

“TOBEL” – not a word.

“TOBET” – not a word.

“TOGEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOHEM” – not a word.

“TOJET” – not a word.

“TOKET” – not a word.

“TOLET” – valid.

“TOMET” – not a word.

“TOPET” – not a word.

“TORET” – R ruled out.

“TOSET” – S ruled out.

“TOTET” – not a word.

“TOVET” – not a word.

“TOWET” – W ruled out.

“TOZET” – not a word.

Thus, the only valid candidate is “TOLET”.

But I realize “TOLET” is obscure. Perhaps the intended word is “TOTEM” – but M is in position 5, and we haven’t tried M yet. However, M is not ruled out. Let me check:

“TOTEM” – T-O-T-E-M – positions: T(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), M(5). This fits the pattern and uses M (new letter).

“TOTEM” is a much more common word than “TOLET,” so it’s a better guess.

Therefore, I choose “TOTEM”.

This tests:
- T(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, E(4) ✓
- T(3) and M(5) are new letters to test
</think>

Based on the confirmed positions T(1), O(2), E(4) and the excluded letters A, R, S, N, Y, W, D, the pattern is T O _ E _. A common word fitting this is ""TOTEM"".

Another candidate: “TOKER” – but R is ruled out.
“TOKEN” – N is ruled out.
“TOILE” – L and I, but E must be position 4; “TOILE” is T-O-I-L-E, where E is position 5 – invalid because E must be in position 4.

Another candidate: “TOPIC” – but C is last, pattern mismatch.

“TOPED” – already tried (D is ruled out).

“TOBIE” – I and E, but E is position 5 here – invalid.

“TOGUE” – U and E, E is position 5 – invalid.

“TOPIE” – invalid.

“TOLAN” – N ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOPET” – not a word.

“TOLET” seems to be the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses new letters (L) we haven’t tested yet.

But let me check another angle – the word family T O _ E _:

Common words:
- TOPES – S is ruled out
- TOLES – S ruled out
- TOLED – D ruled out
- TOMES – S ruled out
- TORES – R, S ruled out
- TOBES – S ruled out
- TOKES – S ruled out
- TOGES – S ruled out
- TOBIE – pattern mismatch (E must be position 4)
- TOQUE – Q and U, U is position 5, E is position 4 – fits! T-O-Q-U-E: pattern T O _ E _, E is position 4, Q-U in 3-5, but length is 5: T-O-Q-U-E – no, that would be T-O-Q-U-E – positions: T(1), O(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5) – but E must be position 4, so this is invalid.

Wait – the pattern is strictly T O _ E _ (positions 1-2-3-4-5), so positions 3 and 5 must be filled.

Valid common words:
- TO LET – “TOLET” is valid
- TO M E T – “TOMET” not a word
- TO P E T – “TOPET” not a word
- TO L E T – “TOLET” is valid
- TO C E T – “TOCET” not a word
- TO B E T – “TOBET” not a word
- TO G E T – “TOGET” not a word
- TO H E T – “TOHET” not a word
- TO K E T – “TOKET” not a word
- TO V E T – “TOVET” not a word
- TO M E T – “TOMET” not a word
- TO F E T – “TOFET” not a word
- TO J E T – “TOJET” not a word
- TO X E T – “TOXET” not a word
- TO Z E T – “TOZET” not a word
- TO L E T – seems the only valid word.

“TOLET” is valid. But I realize “TOLET” is actually more obscure. The most common English word fitting T O _ E _ is “TOKEN” but N is ruled out. Another is “TOLES” but S is ruled out. Let me think again.

“TOMES” – S ruled out.
“TOPER” – R ruled out.
“TOKER” – R ruled out.
“TOLES” – S ruled out.
“TOBIE” – pattern mismatch.

Actually, “BOTEL” is a word, but reversed.

Wait, let me try “TOKED” – but D is ruled out.

“TOBES” – S ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOBIE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOPIC” – pattern mismatch.

“TOILE” – pattern mismatch (E must be 4).

“TOKER” – R ruled out.

“TOLES” – S ruled out.

“TOBET” – not a word.

“TOGET” – not a word.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TOFET” – not a word.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TO JET” – “TOJET” not a word.

“TO KET” – “TOKET” not a word.

“TO LET” – “TOLET” is valid.

“TO MET” – “TOMET” not a word.

“TO PET” – “TOPET” not a word.

“TO RET” – R ruled out.

“TO SET” – S ruled out.

“TO TET” – “TOTET” not a word.

“TO VET” – “TOVET” not a word.

“TO WET” – W is ruled out.

“TO ZET” – not a word.

So “TOLET” is the only valid word that fits. However, it's a bit obscure. Another candidate: “TOILE” is invalid because E must be in position 4, not 5.

Let me think of another word: “TOBEL” is not a word.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words starting with TO and ending with E but E is in position 4.

TO _ E _:
- TOBEE – not a word.
- TOKEE – not a word.
- TOCEE – not a word.
- TOPHE – but H is possible, E is correct in 4, so T O P H E – but this would be T-O-P-H-E – positions 1-2-3-4-5, so E is position 5, which violates the rule that E must be in position 4.

Thus the only valid word seems to be “TOLET”.

But I recall that “TOLET” is a variant spelling of “to let,” used in British English for “to hire out,” and it’s accepted in Scrabble. It uses L and T – T is already known, but L is new.

Another candidate: “TOBIE” – but pattern mismatch.

“TOBIE” is T-O-B-I-E – E is position 5, invalid.

“TOKEE” – not a word.

“TOPEE” – but E is position 5, invalid.

“TOGEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOLEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOLLY” – Y ruled out.

“TOILE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOXIC” – pattern mismatch.

“TOQUE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOZIN” – N ruled out.

“TOXIN” – N ruled out.

“TOILE” – pattern mismatch.

“TOHET” – not a word.

“TOLET” appears to be the only valid word. However, I think I missed “TOKED” – but D is ruled out.

Another word: “TOXEM” – not a word.

“TOGEM” – not a word.

“TOBEM” – not a word.

“TOLEM” – not a word.

“TOBEL” – not a word.

“TOBET” – not a word.

“TOGEE” – E position 5, invalid.

“TOHEM” – not a word.

“TOJET” – not a word.

“TOKET” – not a word.

“TOLET” – valid.

“TOMET” – not a word.

“TOPET” – not a word.

“TORET” – R ruled out.

“TOSET” – S ruled out.

“TOTET” – not a word.

“TOVET” – not a word.

“TOWET” – W ruled out.

“TOZET” – not a word.

Thus, the only valid candidate is “TOLET”.

But I realize “TOLET” is obscure. Perhaps the intended word is “TOTEM” – but M is in position 5, and we haven’t tried M yet. However, M is not ruled out. Let me check:

“TOTEM” – T-O-T-E-M – positions: T(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), M(5). This fits the pattern and uses M (new letter).

“TOTEM” is a much more common word than “TOLET,” so it’s a better guess.

Therefore, I choose “TOTEM”.

This tests:
- T(1) ✓, O(2) ✓, E(4) ✓
- T(3) and M(5) are new letters to testBased on the confirmed positions T(1), O(2), E(4) and the excluded letters A, R, S, N, Y, W, D, the pattern is T O _ E _. A common word fitting this is ""TOTEM"".",Guess 4: TOTEM -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) T(✓) E(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
