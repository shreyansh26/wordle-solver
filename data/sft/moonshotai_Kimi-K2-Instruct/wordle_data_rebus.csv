For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the information gain, as it will quickly eliminate or confirm multiple common letters. 

Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

However, another excellent choice is ""CRANE"" which includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it has a good distribution of common letters across different positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

So the word:
- Does NOT contain C, A, N
- Does contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

I need a new word that:
1. Has 5 letters
2. Uses R and E in new positions
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.)

A good next guess is ""SIREN"" but N is already ruled out. ""DRIVE"" has V which is less common. ""STORE"" has T, O, R, E, S - all common letters and positions R and E differently. Let me try ""STORE"":
- S (position 1) - new letter
- T (position 2) - new letter
- O (position 3) - new letter
- R (position 4) - R in new position (was position 2 last time)
- E (position 5) - but E was position 5 last time and got (-), so E can't be position 5. So ""STORE"" is invalid.

Let me try ""TRIES"":
- T (position 1)
- R (position 2) - but R was position 2 last time and got (-), so R can't be position 2. Invalid.

Let me try ""BREAD"":
- B - new letter
- R - position 2 (invalid, same as above)

Let me try ""TREND"":
- T - new letter
- R - position 2 (invalid)
- E - position 3 (valid new position)
- N - already ruled out

Let me try ""STEER"":
- S - new letter
- T - new letter
- E - position 3 (valid)
- E - position 4 (but we don't know if double E is allowed, and we only know one E exists)
- R - position 5 (valid new position)

Actually, the feedback doesn't specify how many times a letter appears, so ""STEER"" might not be optimal.

Better choice: ""PERCH"" - but C is ruled out.

Next good option: ""METER"" - but R is position 4 (valid), E position 2 (valid), but we have two Es which may not be correct.

Let me try ""BROKE"":
- B - new
- R - position 2 (invalid, was position 2 last time)

Let me try ""ROBED"":
- R - position 1 (valid new position)
- O - new

- E is in word but not in position 5
- C, A, N are NOT in the word

- B is in the correct position (position 3) → pattern R _ B _ _
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew not in 5) → E must be in position 2 or 3, but position 3 is B, so E must be in position 2
- O and D are NOT in the word

So the word must be: R E B _ _

- E must be in position 2 (from above)
- We have used letters: R, E, B are confirmed
- Letters not in word: C, A, N, O, D
- Remaining common letters to try for last position: S, T, L, I, M, P, etc.
