This is my first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. The best strategy for a first guess in Wordle is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
A good starting word should have:
- Multiple vowels (to test vowel positions)
- Common consonants
- No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)

Popular starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, ADIEU, etc. 
I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique
- Uses very common letters
- Has good letter positioning potential

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C : x → C is not in the word at all.
- R : ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- A : x → A is not in the word.
- N : x → N is not in the word.
- E : ✓ → E is in the word and is in position 5.

So the target pattern is: _ R _ _ E

Known letters: R (position 2), E (position 5)
Eliminated letters: C, A, N

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has E in position 5
- Does NOT contain C, A, or N
- Uses only valid letters not yet ruled out

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out, E is fixed)

I can try a word that fills positions 1,3,4 with these constraints.
Let me think of a word that fits _ R _ _ E and uses new letters.

One good candidate is ""PRIDE"":
- P : new letter
- R : matches position 2

- E : matches position 5

Checking ""PRIDE"" against the constraints:
- Doesn't contain C, A, or N
- Has R in spot 2

- All other letters are new tests

Another candidate would be ""TRIBE"", but that uses B which is fine, but I want to test more vowels and common letters. ""PRIDE"" seems better as it tests P, I, D.

From the feedback on GROPE:
- G: x → G is not in the word.
- R: ✓ → R is in the word and in position 2.
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in position 3.
- P: ✓ → P is in the word and in position 4.
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word must be:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: Unknown, but must not be C, A, N, I, D, G or any other eliminated letters.

Known letters and positions:
- 1: ?
- 2: R
- 3: O
- 4: P
- 5: E

Eliminated letters so far: C, A, N, I, D, G
Allowed letters for position 1: B, F, H, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, W, Y (must be a consonant since O is already used as a vowel and the word is 5 letters)

Looking for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R O P E:
- B: BROPE (not a valid word)
- F: FROPE (invalid)
- H: HROPE (invalid)
- K: KROPE (invalid)
- L: LOPE is 4 letters, need 5. L is possible if we form a word like L R O P E → but that would be LROPE (invalid)
- M: MROPE (invalid)
- S: SROPE (invalid)
- T: TROPE (valid word)
- U: UROPE (invalid)
- V: VROPE (invalid)
- W: WROPE (invalid)
- Y: YROPE (invalid)

The only valid word that fits _ R O P E is ""TROPE"".
