For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E (also great letters)
- ADIEU: Contains many vowels
- ROAST: Contains R, O, A, S, T

Looking at letter frequency in English, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S are among the most common. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""SLATE"":
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word and correct position (✓ at position 3)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word has A as its third letter.
2. It contains L, but not as the second letter.
3. It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

Good letters to test next could include common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (R, N, I, O, etc.). Since L is present but not in position 2, let's place L in position 1 or 4. Also, we need to test new vowels and consonants.

A strong next guess would be ""CLAMP"":
- C: new letter
- L: in the word but not position 2 (we're testing position 1)
- A: confirmed at position 3
- M: new letter
- P: new letter

This gives us information about C, M, P while confirming L's placement.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   – A is fixed in position 3.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – S, T, E are not in the word.

2. CLAMP: C(x) L(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
   – L is still “in the word but wrong position”, so it cannot be in position 2 or 1. Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.
   – C, M, P are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT present: S, T, E, C, M, P.

Confirmed facts:
- Word form: _ _ A _ _  (A is definitely the third letter).
- L must appear once, in either position 4 or 5.

We still need to test common remaining consonants (R, N, D, G, B, F, H, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). A good next guess should place L in position 4 or 5, keep A in position 3, and bring in fresh letters.

A strategic choice: FLANK
- F: new consonant
- L: placed in position 2 (but we already know L is not in position 2) → that would be wasteful.

Better choice: BLANK
- B: new consonant
- L: position 2 (again wasteful)

Optimal placement: place L in position 4: _ _ A L _

A good candidate that obeys all constraints and introduces new common letters is:
