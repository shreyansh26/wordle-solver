Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of getting hits. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in 5-letter English words are A, E, S, O, R, I, L, T, N, and U. 

A good starting word should contain several of these common letters. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters in 5-letter words.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A-, R×, O×, S×, E-):
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

From Guess 2 (PLATE → P×, L-, A-, T-, E-):
- P is not in the word.
- L is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (confirms earlier “not position 1” and now “not position 3”).
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (confirms earlier).

So we have:
Letters known to be present: A, E, L, T
Letters known absent: P, R, O, S
Positions ruled out:
- A ≠ 1, 3
- E ≠ 5
- L ≠ 2
- T ≠ 4

The remaining alphabet (possible letters) is:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
plus the confirmed letters A, E, L, T.

We now want a word that contains A, E, L, T and one new letter from the remaining pool, arranged so that:
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
- L is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- T is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter English word satisfying these constraints.

Candidate word: LATTE
Check positions:
L: position 1 – allowed (not ruled out).
A: position 2 – allowed (only ruled out 1 & 3).
T: position 3 – allowed (only ruled out 4).
T: position 4 – T already appears once; duplicate letters are allowed in Wordle.
E: position 5 – ruled out. So LATTE fails on E.

Candidate word: METAL
M is new.
Positions:
M:1 (ok)
E:2 (ok)
T:3 (ok)
A:4 (ok)
L:5 (ok)
This obeys every positional restriction and uses four confirmed letters plus a new letter.

This obeys every positional restriction and uses four confirmed letters plus a new letter.

Let’s add the new information from Guess 3 (METAL → M×, E-, T-, A✓, L-):

- M is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- A is in the word and IS in position 4 (✓ position 4).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Consolidated facts so far:
Known letters in the word: A, E, L, T
Known absent letters: P, R, O, S, M
Position restrictions:
- A is fixed at position 4.
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.
- T is not in positions 3 or 4.
- L is not in positions 2 or 5.
- A is already placed at 4, so we now have:
  _ _ _ A _

We still need to place E, L, T plus one more letter that has not been eliminated (any letter not in {P,R,O,S,M}).

Looking at the five slots:
[1] [2] [3] [4=A] [5]

Constraints:
- E ∈ {1,3,4} but 4 is A, so E ∈ {1,3}
- T ∈ {1,2,5} (cannot be 3 or 4)
- L ∈ {1,3} (cannot be 2 or 5)

We must use each of A, E, L, T exactly once, so the fifth letter must be an unused consonant. Common unused letters left: N, C, D, B, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s try to combine the remaining letters while satisfying constraints.

Try pattern:
- If E is at 1: E _ _ A _
- Then T must be at 2 or 5
- And L must be at 3
- Then we need one more consonant at the remaining spot.

Example: E T L A ?  
But then we need a 5th letter; the word would be ET_LA_ which is not valid.

Another pattern: T E L A _ – but T would have to be at 1, E at 2 (but E cannot be at 2) -> invalid.

Try L E T A _:
- L at 1 – allowed
- E at 2 – not allowed (E cannot be at 2)

Try L A is fixed at 4, so let’s consider:

_ _ L A E – but E cannot be at 5.

Let’s systematically list possible placements:

Option 1: E at 1
E _ L A T – check constraints:
- E at 1 – ok
- L at 3 – ok (not 2 or 5)
- T at 5 – ok (not 3 or 4)
- Letters used: E, L, A, T – one missing letter at position 2. We need a new letter that has not appeared. Common remaining: N, C, D, B, etc.

Possible valid English word: E N L A T – but ""ENLAT"" is not a word.
Try E C L A T -> ""eclat"" is valid.

Check if we have any conflict for C – C has not been ruled out.

So candidate: ECLAT

Option 2: E at 3
_ E L A T
- E at 3 – ok
- L at 3 conflicts with E – so invalid.

Option 3: T at 1
T _ _ A _
- Then E and L must fit in positions 2 and 3 (since they cannot be at 5).
- E cannot be at 2, so E must be at 3, L at 2.
- Word: T L E A _ – but then we need a 5th letter at 5. ""TLEA_"" is not forming a valid word.

Option 4: T at 2
_ T _ A _
- E must be at 1 or 3
- L must be at 1 or 3
- If E at 1, L at 3: E T L A _ – ""ETLA_"" – no valid word
- If E at 3, L at 1: L T E A _ – ""LTEA_"" – no valid word

Option 5: T at 5
_ _ _ A T
- E and L must be at 1 and 2 or 1 and 3, etc.
- E cannot be at 2, L cannot be at 2 or 5.
- E at 1, L at 3: E _ L A T – same as Option 1.

From above, only viable candidate is ECLAT, which is a valid English word.
