For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of positions to help narrow down possibilities. The classic Wordle strategy is to start with a word that has common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains three common vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowel positions
2. It has common consonants (R, S) 
3. It uses 5 unique letters which provides maximum information

- keeps the known A and S in different positions,
- adds a new vowel (I or U),
- adds new consonants.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters and positions:
- S is fixed at position 1
- N is fixed at position 2
- A is fixed at position 3
So the word looks like: S N A _ _

Known letters NOT in the word:
R, O, E, I, T, C

Still need two letters for positions 4 and 5.
Possible remaining common consonants (not ruled out):
L, D, P, M, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

K is known to be in the word (from feedback: K(-)) but not yet placed.
So K must be in position 4 or 5.

Try placing K in position 4: S N A K _
Then position 5 must be a new consonant. Common ones left: L, D, M, etc.

Let’s try S N A K E – but E is ruled out.
S N A K D – D not tried, seems plausible.
S N A K Y – Y could work as a vowel-like letter.

Let me pick ""SNAKY"" to test K in position 4 and Y in position 5.
