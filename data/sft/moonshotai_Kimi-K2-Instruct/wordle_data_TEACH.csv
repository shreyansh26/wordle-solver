- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Popular starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, etc. Some strong first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing coverage
4. It's a common word that should provide good initial information

This should help reveal which vowels are present and give clues about R and S positioning.

From the feedback on RAISE:

1. R, I, S are not in the word at all (x).
2. A and E are somewhere in the word, but not in their guessed positions (positions 2 and 5 respectively).

Next steps:
- Exclude R, I, S from every position.
- A must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We still need to find 3 other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, S).

Candidate letters left: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that contains both A and E, places them in new positions, and introduces 3 new consonants.

Good next-guess features:
- Include both A and E.
- Place A in position 3 or 4 (common for A), and E in position 2 or 3.
- Use common consonants like L, N, T, G, etc.

Candidate words:
- OCEAN (but O and N still need testing)
- METAL (but T, L still need testing)
- LEANT (but T, N still need testing)
- FLEA (but it's 4 letters)
- TREAD (but T, D still need testing)
- MEANT (but T, N still need testing)
- PLATE (but P, L, T still need testing)
- BEACH (but B, C, H still need testing)

After filtering out R, I, S, the best word containing both A and E in new positions is ""OCEAN"":
- O is in position 1
- C is new
- E is in position 2 (new position)
- A is in position 3 (new position)
- N is new

Let's check if ""OCEAN"" is valid:
- Contains A and E in new positions (A not in 2, E not in 5).
- Introduces O, C, N as new consonants.
- No R, I, S.
- Common English word.

This seems optimal for the next guess.

So far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, O, N (all received “x”).
- Letters we know ARE in the word but are not yet in the correct spot: A, C, E.  
  – A was in position 2 in RAISE and position 4 in OCEAN → must be in position 1, 3 or 5.  
  – C was in position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4 or 5.  
  – E was in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4 or 5.

We still need to discover two more distinct letters (the word is 5 letters long and we only have 3 known letters so far).

A good third guess should:
1. Place A, C, E in new positions that respect the constraints above.
2. Introduce two new common consonants that haven’t been eliminated (e.g., T, L, D, M, etc.).

Let’s try “TEACH”:
- Positions: 1 T, 2 E, 3 A, 4 C, 5 H
   – E moves to position 2 (valid, it wasn’t in 2 before)  
   – A moves to position 3 (valid, not in 3 before)  
   – C moves to position 4 (valid, not in 4 before)  
   – Introduces T and H (both still possible).  
- Contains no banned letters (R, I, S, O, N) and uses all three known letters plus two new ones.
