For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters to maximize information gained. 

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that should provide significant information regardless of the actual word.

We now know the secret word:
- ends with E (last letter is correct)
- does NOT contain R, A, I, or S

Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Since the first four letters of the word are still unknown, I’ll try a word that brings in fresh high-frequency letters while keeping the final E fixed.  
Among the most frequent consonants not yet used are T, N, L, and among vowels O and U.

A balanced candidate is “TONE” – but that’s only four letters. Extending it, “TUNER” uses five letters and includes T, U, N, E, and R. However, we already know R is not in the word, so R is wasted. Instead, let’s drop R and use another consonant: “TUNEL” isn’t valid. Trying another mix, “DUNGE” is not a word either. A valid word with high-frequency unused letters is “UNTIE”, but that uses I (already excluded). 

Next valid high-frequency combination: “LENTE” is invalid. “PLENT” invalid. “BLUNT” invalid. 

Let’s build a valid word that keeps E in position 5 and uses fresh common letters in positions 1-4. A good one is “BLEND” – but D is at the end and must be E. Instead, “CLONE” fits:
- C, L, O, N are new
- it keeps final E
- it’s a valid 5-letter word

- The letters L and O are somewhere in positions 1–4
- The remaining two letters must be new and not in {R, A, I, S, C, N}

We need a valid five-letter word that:
- ends with E
- contains L and O somewhere in positions 1–4
- uses only letters from the remaining pool

Let’s list possibilities:
- O and L could be in positions 1–4, with two new letters in the remaining slots.

- OLDIE – but I is excluded
- OMBRE – but R is excluded
- OGLE is only 4 letters
- PROLE – P, R, O, L, E – but R is excluded
- POULE – U is available, but N is excluded, so OK? Wait, N is excluded but not in POULE.

- _ _ _ _ E
- contains L and O
- positions of L and O not known

Try placing both O and L in the first three positions.

Possible patterns:
O L _ _ E – need two new letters, but only one slot left. That’s only 4 letters. No.

O _ L _ E – same issue.

_ O L _ E – need one letter before O and one after L.

So pattern: _ O L _ E or _ _ O L E or L _ O _ E or similar.

We need a consonant in the first position, not R, A, I, S, C, N.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y

A valid word with high-frequency unused letters is “UNTIE”, but that uses I (already excluded). 

Next valid high-frequency combination: “LENTE” is invalid. “PLENT” invalid. “BLUNT” invalid. 

Let’s build a valid word that keeps E in position 5 and uses fresh common letters in positions 1-4. A good one is “BLEND” – but D is at the end and must be E. Instead, “CLONE” fits:
- C, L, O, N are new
- it keeps final E
- it’s a valid 5-letter word

So “CLONE”.

<guess>CLONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CLONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
- Word ends in E: _ _ _ _ E
- Confirmed letters in the word: L (2nd position), O (3rd position), E (5th position)
  (But note: the feedback for CLONE shows L(✓) and O(✓) only in the sense that those letters are in the word; we don’t yet know their exact positions)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, C, N (from RAISE and CLONE feedback)

So the structure is now:
- 5th letter is E
- The letters L and O are somewhere in positions 1–4
- The remaining two letters must be new and not in {R, A, I, S, C, N}

Common letters still available: D, T, G, M, P, B, U, Y, F, H, K, etc.

We need a valid five-letter word that:
- ends with E
- contains L and O somewhere in positions 1–4
- uses only letters from the remaining pool

Let’s list possibilities:
- O and L could be in positions 1–4, with two new letters in the remaining slots.

Candidate words:
- OLDIE – but I is excluded
- OMBRE – but R is excluded
- OGLE is only 4 letters
- PROLE – P, R, O, L, E – but R is excluded
- POULE – U is available, but N is excluded, so OK? Wait, N is excluded but not in POULE.

Wait, let’s construct:
We know:
- _ _ _ _ E
- contains L and O
- positions of L and O not known

Try placing both O and L in the first three positions.

Possible patterns:
O L _ _ E – need two new letters, but only one slot left. That’s only 4 letters. No.

O _ L _ E – same issue.

_ O L _ E – need one letter before O and one after L.

So pattern: _ O L _ E or _ _ O L E or L _ O _ E or similar.

Let’s pick a valid word following _ O L _ E:
We need a consonant in the first position, not R, A, I, S, C, N.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Try D: D O L _ E → “DOLEE” – invalid.

Try B: B O L _ E → “BOLEE” – invalid.

Try F: F O L _ E → “FOLEY” – but Y is allowed, ends with Y, but we know last letter must be E. So “FOLEE” invalid.

Try M: M O L _ E → “MOLEE” – invalid.

Try P: P O L _ E → “POLEE” – invalid.

Try T: T O L _ E → “TOLEE” – invalid.

Hmm, maybe _ _ O L E pattern:

First two letters must be new, not R, A, I, S, C, N.

Try B U O L E – invalid.

Try D U O L E – invalid.

Try G O O L E – but double O, word “GOOLE” – not standard.

Try B O O L E – “BOOLE” – not common.

Try M O O L E – “MOOLE” – invalid.

Try alternative placement: L _ O _ E

Need first letter L, then a new letter, then O, then new letter, then E.

L _ O _ E:

L B O N E – but N is excluded.

L D O M E – “LODME” – invalid.

L D O S E – S excluded.

L D O R E – R excluded.

L H O M E – “LHOME” – invalid.

L D O G E – “LODGE” – let’s check:
Letters: L, O, D, G, E – all allowed (R, A, I, S, C, N excluded)
And it’s a valid 5-letter word.

Perfect.

So “LODGE”.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. The word ends in E: _ _ _ _ E
2. Letters that are in the word (correct but positions unknown): L, O, G
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, C, N, D

So the 5-letter word contains L, O, G and ends with E.  
The remaining one letter must be from the still-unused common letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

The known letters must occupy the first four positions in some order.  
Possible valid arrangements:
- G, L, O, _, E
- G, O, L, _, E
- L, G, O, _, E
- etc., keeping the 4th slot a new consonant and checking that the word is real.

Candidate words:
– GLOBE: uses B (allowed) → G L O B E
– GLOVE: uses V (allowed) → G L O V E
– GLOZE: Z is uncommon and might be excluded, so skip.
– GLOME: archaic/uncommon.
– GOLEM: ends in M, not E → invalid.
– GOOLE: contains double O and ends in E but has no L.

Between GLOBE and GLOVE, both contain the required letters and use allowed consonants.  
GLOVE feels slightly more common, so try that.

Current confirmed information:

Structure: _ _ _ _ E (position 5 is E)

Letters known to be in the word: G, L, O, E  
Letters known NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, C, N, D, V

Thus the word contains G, L, O (in unknown positions) and ends with E.  
We still need one more letter from the remaining pool: B, F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y.

Possible arrangements of G, L, O in positions 1–4, plus one fresh consonant, ending in E:

1. G L O _ E  
2. G O L _ E  
3. L G O _ E  
4. L O G _ E  
5. O G L _ E  
6. O L G _ E  

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns.  
Checking common consonants:

- G L O B E → GLOBE (uses B, allowed)  
- G L O M E → not a word  
- G L O T E → not a word  
- G O L F E → not a word  
- G O L P E → not a word  
- L O G I E → I excluded  
- B O L G E → not a word

Among real words, the only one that fits is GLOBE.

Let’s verify:
GLOBE contains G, L, O, B, E  
B is still allowed (not previously excluded), and all other constraints are satisfied.
