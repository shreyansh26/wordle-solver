For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel coverage to maximize information gain. Some common starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E) which should provide good feedback about which letters are present in the word.

We know from the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is NOT in the word (x).
- A is IN the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is IN the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word contains both A and E, but neither A nor E is in the 3rd or 5th positions, respectively. It also lacks S, L, and T.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps A and E but places them in new positions.
2. Avoids S, L, T.
3. Introduces the remaining common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R (new letter, common consonant)
- E (in position 2 instead of 5)
- A (in position 3 instead of 2)
- C (new letter)
- T (already ruled out, so let’s swap) – Actually, T is excluded, so I’ll replace with another common letter: “DREAD” has D twice; “CRANE” has T (no), “CARED” has E in 4 (good), A in 3 (but A was in 2, now 3 is new). Let me try “CARED”:
- C, A, R, E, D. Positions: A in 3, E in 4. This seems useful.

Even better: “DREAD” has D twice, wasting info. “CRANE” has T (no), but “CARED” looks solid. Another option is “ACORN” but O is untested and N/R are good. To test N and R, I’ll go with “CRANE” even though it doesn’t use D.

Wait, CRANE has T (no), but actually CRANE is C,R,A,N,E – no T. So CRANE is valid. But A is in 3 now (was 2), E is in 5 (was 5, same as before – not ideal). Let’s try “EARLY”:
- E in 1, A in 2, R, L (already excluded), Y – L is excluded, so skip.

“PEACH” has P (new), E in 4, A in 2 – P, C, H are new. Seems good.
But let’s prioritize testing common letters. I’ll choose “CRANE” to test R and N while shifting A and E positions.

Actually, better: “ACORN” tests A in 1, C, O, R, N – but O is less common. I’ll go with “CRANE” as it tests R,N and repositions A,E.

From the two guesses we now know:

- C is in position 1 (from CRANE → C✓).
- R is in position 2 (from CRANE → R✓).
- A is in the word but not position 2 (from CRANE → A-), and not position 3 (from SLATE → A-). So A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5, but position 1 is already C, so A must be in 4 or 5.
- E is in the word but not position 5 (from SLATE → E-) and not position 4 (from CRANE → E-), so E must be in position 3.

Between CRAVE and CRAZE, both fit all constraints. CRAVE tests V (new letter), while CRAZE tests Z (less common). I’ll choose CRAVE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel coverage to maximize information gain. Some common starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E) which should provide good feedback about which letters are present in the word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We know from the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is NOT in the word (x).
- A is IN the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is IN the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word contains both A and E, but neither A nor E is in the 3rd or 5th positions, respectively. It also lacks S, L, and T.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps A and E but places them in new positions.
2. Avoids S, L, T.
3. Introduces the remaining common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R (new letter, common consonant)
- E (in position 2 instead of 5)
- A (in position 3 instead of 2)
- C (new letter)
- T (already ruled out, so let’s swap) – Actually, T is excluded, so I’ll replace with another common letter: “DREAD” has D twice; “CRANE” has T (no), “CARED” has E in 4 (good), A in 3 (but A was in 2, now 3 is new). Let me try “CARED”:
- C, A, R, E, D. Positions: A in 3, E in 4. This seems useful.

Even better: “DREAD” has D twice, wasting info. “CRANE” has T (no), but “CARED” looks solid. Another option is “ACORN” but O is untested and N/R are good. To test N and R, I’ll go with “CRANE” even though it doesn’t use D.

Wait, CRANE has T (no), but actually CRANE is C,R,A,N,E – no T. So CRANE is valid. But A is in 3 now (was 2), E is in 5 (was 5, same as before – not ideal). Let’s try “EARLY”:
- E in 1, A in 2, R, L (already excluded), Y – L is excluded, so skip.

“PEACH” has P (new), E in 4, A in 2 – P, C, H are new. Seems good.
But let’s prioritize testing common letters. I’ll choose “CRANE” to test R and N while shifting A and E positions.

Actually, better: “ACORN” tests A in 1, C, O, R, N – but O is less common. I’ll go with “CRANE” as it tests R,N and repositions A,E.

- R is in position 2 (from CRANE → R✓).
- A is in the word but not position 2 (from CRANE → A-), and not position 3 (from SLATE → A-). So A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5, but position 1 is already C, so A must be in 4 or 5.
- E is in the word but not position 5 (from SLATE → E-) and not position 4 (from CRANE → E-), so E must be in position 3.
