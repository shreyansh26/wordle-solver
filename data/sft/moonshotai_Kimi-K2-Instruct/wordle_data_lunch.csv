For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they cover frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

The feedback from AROSE shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a lot of common English letters—especially vowels—so we should pivot toward words that avoid those letters entirely.

Looking at the remaining frequent consonants and vowels:  
- Consonants still in play: B C D F G H J K L M N P T W Y Z  
- Vowels still in play: I U (since A, O, E are all ruled out)

A good second-guess word should use several of these remaining letters to gather maximum information.  
One strong candidate is “UNITY” because it uses the remaining vowels U and I plus three different consonants (N, T, Y).  
Another good option is “BLUNT” or “FLUNK,” but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced.

I’ll try “UNITY.”

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned: A, R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (all x).

From Guess 2 (UNITY) we learned:
- U is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- I, T, Y are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains U and N
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y
- U cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in position 2

Remaining candidate letters (not ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: U only (A, O, E, I all ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- U somewhere (not first)
- N somewhere (not second)
- Only letters from the allowed set

Some possible patterns:
- _ N _ _ U (N in 2, U in 5) - but N can't be in 2
- _ _ N _ U
- _ _ _ N U
- N _ U _ _ (but U can't be in 1)
- N _ _ U _
- _ N U _ _
- etc.

Let's look for valid English words satisfying these constraints. A good systematic approach is to think of words with U and N, checking positions.

Examples to test:
- ""BLUNK"" - but N is in 3 (allowed), U in 4 (allowed). Let's check letters: B, L, U, N, K - all allowed and positions fit.
- ""CLUNK"" - similar structure
- ""PLUMB"" - has U in 3, N is missing though

Between BLUNK and CLUNK, both are good candidates. I'll choose BLUNK as it uses B, L, U, N, K - all fresh letters to test.

A good systematic approach is to think of words with U and N, checking positions.\n\nExamples to test:\n- ""BLUNK"" - but N is in 3 (allowed), U in 4 (allowed). Let\'s check letters: B, L, U, N, K - all allowed and positions fit.\n- ""CLUNK"" - similar structure\n- ""PLUMB"" - has U in 3, N is missing though\n\nBetween BLUNK and CLUNK, both are good candidates. I\'ll choose BLUNK as it uses B, L, U, N, K - all fresh letters to test.\n\n<guess>BLUNK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) I(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: BLUNK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) U(-) N(-) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (from AROSE and BLUNK):  
A, R, O, S, E, B, K, I, T, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
U, N, L  (each of these was marked “-” once, meaning it exists but in a different spot)

Positions that each of those letters CANNOT occupy (from the feedback):
- U cannot be in positions 1 (UNITY) or 3 (BLUNK)
- N cannot be in positions 2 (UNITY) or 4 (BLUNK)
- L cannot be in position 2 (BLUNK)

Allowable letters left (besides U, N, L):
Consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels: U (only vowel left)

We need a 5-letter word that uses:
- exactly one U, one N, one L (no repeats of these)  
- two more letters drawn from the remaining allowable consonants  
- with the position constraints above.

Possible skeletons (three of the five slots are U, N, L; the other two are fresh consonants):

Quick scan of valid English words satisfying these rules:
- L U N _ _  → but N cannot be in position 3 (it was - in BLUNK, so not 4; 3 is still okay? Wait: in BLUNK N was in 4, feedback - means ""exists but not in 4""; so N can be 1,2,3,5 but not 2,4. So N can be 1,3,5)
- F L U N G   → L U N G: N is in 4 (forbidden), so discard
- P L U N K   → has K (forbidden), so discard
- D U N C E   → has E (forbidden)
- L U N C H   → N is in 3 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), C and H new.  
  This word satisfies every constraint:
  – Letters used: L, U, N, C, H – all allowed
  – U not in 1 or 3 → ok (it’s in 2)
  – N not in 2 or 4 → ok (it’s in 3)
  – L not in 2 → ok (it’s in 1)

Therefore, LUNCH is a valid next guess.
