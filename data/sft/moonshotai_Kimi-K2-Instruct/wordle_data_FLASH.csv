For the first guess, the goal is to maximize the amount of information gained. This typically means choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a good variety of vowels and consonants. Some classic starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" etc. 

Let's go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: another very common vowel

This combination gives us a strong chance of hitting multiple letters in the right or wrong positions early on.

   - S is fixed in position 4 → _ _ _ S _
   - A exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.

2. COAST → C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - No C, O, T in the word.
   - A is now confirmed in position 3 → _ _ A S _

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-placed A and S).

We need two initial consonants to fill positions 1 and 2, and a final letter for position 5.

Good candidate consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, Y.

Possible endings for position 5: a fresh consonant (not yet eliminated) or Y for an adjective form.

Common patterns with _ _ A S _:
- B L A S T → T is out (from COAST).
- G L A S S → good pattern, but S is already in 4 and we don’t know if double-S is allowed yet, and letters G and L are still valid.
- P L A S M → M still valid.
- F L A S K → K still valid.
- H A S P → too short.
- B A S I C → I is out.

Let me consider FLASH: but H is okay, F, L, A, S, H. We know A is in 3, S in 4, so F, L, H are new. But we need _ _ A S _. FLASH doesn’t fit the pattern A in 3, S in 4.

Best candidates fitting _ _ A S _:
- B L A S T → T out.
- C L A S P → C out.
- F L A S K → K is allowed, F, L, K are new.
- G L A S S → S already in 4, double S possible.
- P L A S M → M allowed.
- B R A S S → R out.
- C L A S S → C out.

Going with FLASH is out because it’s _ _ A S _ needed.

Best seems: FLASK
F, L new; A confirmed at 3; S at 4; K new. All letters are valid per prior feedback.

Step 1 – Summarize all knowledge so far  
- Positional certainties  
  – 3rd letter = A  
  – 4th letter = S  
  – So the pattern is: _ _ A S _  

- Letters completely eliminated  
  R, I, E, C, O, T, K  

- Letters now confirmed present and in the correct spots  
  F (1st), L (2nd), A (3rd), S (4th) → first four letters are F L A S  

Step 2 – Determine the only remaining unknown  
We need a 5th letter that is still allowed and has not been ruled out.  
Allowed consonants/vowels not yet used or eliminated include: B, D, G, H, J, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  

Step 3 – Find the single English word that fits  
The only common 5-letter English word that starts FLAS- is:  
FLASK – but K has been eliminated (Guess 3 feedback).  

Next possible endings:  
- FLASh – H is still allowed.  
- FLASs – double-S; S is already known and position 4 is taken, so S cannot appear again in position 5.  
- No other standard endings yield real words.  

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is FLASH, with H in position 5.  

Step 4 – Verify no contradictions  
- H has not been tested or eliminated in prior guesses → safe.  
- Word exists in English (FLASH).
