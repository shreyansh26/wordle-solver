For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The best strategy is to use a word with 5 unique, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Some excellent first-guess options include:
- CRANE (common letters C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (all vowels plus D)
- ADIEU (all vowels plus D)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains some of the most common letters in English and covers both vowels and consonants spread across different positions.

None of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge swath of common letters.  
I should now focus on the other high-frequency consonants and vowels that were not in CRANE, chiefly: T, S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y.

A balanced next guess should use 5 new unique letters that cover several of these groups.  
Good candidates include:
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)
- BUMPY (B, U, M, P, Y)
- FIGHT (F, I, G, H, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)

I’ll choose “SLUMP” because it introduces S, L, U, M, P—five fresh, fairly common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

- Letter L is in the correct position (3rd spot)

Let's think of 5-letter words with L in the 3rd position that also contain S. Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, I, O, D, G, H, K, F, Y, B.

- SILLY (but I and Y are possible, double L but position 3 is already L)
- SOLID (O, I, D are good candidates)

Let’s translate the feedback for BOLTS:

B ✓   → B is correct in position 1  
O x   → O is not in the word at all  
L -   → L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we previously thought it was fixed there—this contradicts that).  
T x   → T is not in the word  
S ✓   → S is correct in position 5  

So the actual pattern we now know is:
- B in position 1
- S in position 5
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Letters ruled out so far: C, R, A, N, E, U, M, P, O, T

The word shape is: B _ _ _ S  
We need a letter in position 2, 3, 4 and we know L must be one of those, but not in position 3.  
So L could be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list possible remaining letters (not yet used or ruled out): D, F, G, H, I, K, Y, W, V, J, Q, Z.  
We want common ones, so focus on D, F, G, H, I, K, Y.

If L is in position 2: B L _ _ S → _ must be common letters. Options could be “BLISS” (but I is okay, double S already used), “BLIPS” but P is out.  
If L is in position 4: B _ _ L S → need two more letters. “BILLS” (but double L is fine, I is okay), “BELLS” but E is out, “BOWLS” but O is out.  

Actually, looking at remaining letters, “BLISS” uses B, L, I, S, S (double S allowed) and all letters fit constraints.  
But we already have S in position 5, so position 4 could be anything.  

Another good candidate: “BILLS” – letters B, I, L, L, S.  
- B and S positions correct.  
- L appears twice: one L must be in position 2 or 4 (not 3), which fits.  
- I is a new letter to test.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The best strategy is to use a word with 5 unique, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Some excellent first-guess options include:
- CRANE (common letters C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (all vowels plus D)
- ADIEU (all vowels plus D)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains some of the most common letters in English and covers both vowels and consonants spread across different positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge swath of common letters.  
I should now focus on the other high-frequency consonants and vowels that were not in CRANE, chiefly: T, S, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y.

A balanced next guess should use 5 new unique letters that cover several of these groups.  
Good candidates include:
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P)
- BUMPY (B, U, M, P, Y)
- FIGHT (F, I, G, H, T)
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T)

I’ll choose “SLUMP” because it introduces S, L, U, M, P—five fresh, fairly common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

So the pattern so far: _ _ L _ _
And the word must contain an S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since we know L is in position 3, S could be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of 5-letter words with L in the 3rd position that also contain S. Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, I, O, D, G, H, K, F, Y, B.

Some possibilities:
- BOLTS (but we don't know about B, O, T yet)
- SILLY (but I and Y are possible, double L but position 3 is already L)
- SOLID (O, I, D are good candidates)
- FILMS (F, I, M - but M was x in SLUMP)
- GLOSS (G, O, S - but double S might be wasteful)

Let's go with ""BOLTS"" - it uses B, O, T, S, and we know L is in position 3. This will test several new letters (B, O, T) while respecting the known constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters definitely ruled out (never appear):  
C, R, A, N, E, U, M, P, O, T

Letters we are certain about:  
B is in position 1.  
S is in position 5.

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
L must appear at least once somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (since both L’s in BILLS received “-”, meaning they were in the wrong place).  
I received a “-”, so I is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is:  
B _ _ _ S  
with:  
- L must appear once (only once, because if it appeared twice we’d have seen at least one ✓)  
- L cannot be in positions 3 or 4.  
- Therefore L must be in position 2.  
- I must appear somewhere but NOT in position 2 (and position 5 is already S). So I must be in position 3 or 4.

Hence the only possible skeletons are:  
B L I _ S   or   B L _ I S

Remaining unused common letters (from D F G H K Y):  
D, F, G, H, K, Y are still possible for the blank.

Let’s test BLIPS? P is already ruled out (P x in SLUMP).  
BLISS? We’d already have two S’s— but we already know S is in position 5; there’s no evidence for a second S and earlier feedback never confirmed it.  

BLIND? N is ruled out.  

BLIMY? M is ruled out.  

What about B L I K S? K hasn’t been used.  

BLIKS is not a valid word.  

BLI… how about B L I D S → “BLIDS” isn’t a recognized word.  

B L I F S → “BLIFS”? Not valid.  

B L I G S → “BLIGS”? Not valid.  

B L I H S → “BLIHS”? Not valid.  

B L I Y S → “BLIYS”? Not valid.  

So the only real candidate that fits “BL _ _ S” with I in 3 or 4 and the remaining letters is:  

B L I _ S: we need a valid 5-letter word with I in 3rd and one more consonant in 4th.  

Valid English 5-letter words fitting B L I _ S:  
- BLISS (but we have no evidence for a second S)  
- BLIPS (P ruled out)  
- BLIMP (P ruled out)  
- BLINK (N ruled out)  
- BLITZ (T ruled out)  
- BLIGH (but that’s a proper noun BLIGH)  
- BLIVE – not a word  
- BLIDE – archaic, not standard  

Wait, we missed: BLIND (N out), BLIMP (P out), BLISS (second S unconfirmed).  

Actually, the only valid common word left appears to be BLISS, despite the worry about second S.  

But let me double-check: we have B _ _ _ S with L in position 2 and I somewhere and remaining letter.  

Another angle: if L is in position 2, and I is in position 4, then the word must be B L _ I S.  

Possible:  
B L D I S → “BLDIS”? Not a word.  
B L G I S → “BLGIS”? No.  
B L F I S → “BLFIS”? No.  
B L Y I S → “BLYIS”? No.  
B L H I S → “BLHIS”? No.  

The only standard word that pops up is BLISS. We have no evidence yet that the word has only one S, and we know S is in position 5. A second S in position 4 would be consistent with current feedback (no contradiction).  

Hence the most reasonable next guess is BLISS.
