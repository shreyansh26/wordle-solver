For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

From the first feedback:
- Only the letter S was in the word and in the correct position (the 4th spot).
- The letters A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The remaining letters (positions 1, 2, 3 and 5) must be from the other 21 letters (excluding A, R, O, E).
3. We still have no information about T, I, N, L, U, etc.

A good second guess would use new letters to test as many new possibilities as possible, while keeping S in the 4th position. Words like:
- HINTS (tests H, I, N, T)
- LINTS (tests L, I, N, T)
- DUSTS (tests D, U, T)

I'll choose HINTS because it tests common letters H, I, N, T while keeping S in the known correct position.

From the three guesses we know:

1. Word ends in S (position 4 is always ✓).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, O, E, H, N, T, C, K
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   – I (present somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3)
   – L (present somewhere, but not in position 1)

So the pattern is:
_ _ _ S _  
with S fixed in position 4.

I must be in position 1 or 5 (it hasn’t been tried there yet).  
L must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (it hasn’t been tried in 2 or 3; position 5 is still open).

A good 4th guess should:
- Keep S in position 4.
- Put I in position 1 or 5 to lock its location.
- Put L in an allowed position (2, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new, common letters.

Option 1: I _ _ S _
Option 2: _ _ _ S I

Let’s try option 1:  
If we place I at the start, we can test L in position 2 or 3 and use two new consonants.

Candidate: I L _ S _  
The letters B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are still untested.

A common word fitting this is “IDLES”, but E is already ruled out.  
Another: “IMPIS” – duplicate I and plural form, unlikely.  
“IDYLS” is valid, uses D and Y, and keeps L in position 2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

2. The remaining letters (positions 1, 2, 3 and 5) must be from the other 21 letters (excluding A, R, O, E).
3. We still have no information about T, I, N, L, U, etc.

A good second guess would use new letters to test as many new possibilities as possible, while keeping S in the 4th position. Words like:
- HINTS (tests H, I, N, T)
- LINTS (tests L, I, N, T)
- DUSTS (tests D, U, T)

We still need to place I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5. The remaining unused common consonants/letters include: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 4.
- Try I in a new position (1, 3, or 5).
- Use other new, common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- LICKS (tests L, I, C, K)
- PICKS (tests P, I, C, K)
- FLIPS (tests F, L, I, P)

- Keep S in position 4.
- Put I in position 1 or 5 to lock its location.
- Put L in an allowed position (2, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new, common letters.

Option 1: I _ _ S _
Option 2: _ _ _ S I

Let’s try option 1:  
If we place I at the start, we can test L in position 2 or 3 and use two new consonants.

Candidate: I L _ S _  
The letters B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are still untested.

A common word fitting this is “IDLES”, but E is already ruled out.  
Another: “IMPIS” – duplicate I and plural form, unlikely.  
“IDYLS” is valid, uses D and Y, and keeps L in position 2.

Let me choose IDYLS.

Checks:
I – new position 1  
D, Y – new letters  
L – position 2 (allowed, hasn’t been tried there)  
S – position 4 (locked)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the four guesses we now know:

1. Word ends in S (position 4 is always ✓).
2. Letters that are **excluded** from the word:
   A, R, O, E, H, N, T, C, K, D, Y
3. Letters that are **in the word** but whose exact positions are still unclear:
   – I (present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3)
   – L (present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 4)

So far the pattern is:
_ _ _ S _

Possible positions for I: only **position 5** (all earlier positions are eliminated).  
Possible positions for L: only **position 3** (positions 1, 2, 4 are eliminated).

Thus the skeleton must be:
_ _ L S I

We still need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the unused set {B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}, avoiding duplicates and aiming for common English bigrams.

A perfectly valid word matching this skeleton is **FILMS** (F, I, L, M, S), but M and F have not been tested yet. Let’s check if all letters are allowed:
- F, I, L, M, S: none of them appear in the excluded list.
- Position constraints:
  – I is in position 5 (allowed).
  – L is in position 3 (allowed).

Therefore **FILMS** fits every rule.

Let’s consolidate what the five clues tell us.

1. Position 4 is always ✓ for S, so the word is: _ _ _ S _.

2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word (x-feedback):
   A, R, O, E, H, N, T, C, K, D, Y, F, M.

3. Letters confirmed IN the word but with unknown exact positions (– feedback):
   - I: tried in positions 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 1 (the only spot never yet tested for I).
   - L: tried in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in position 5 (the only spot never yet tested for L).

Hence the skeleton is now locked to:
I _ _ S L

We only need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the still-unused pool:  
{B, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}.

The most common bigram that fits is “B” and “G” → “IBGSL” is not an English word, but “IGBSL” or “IBGSL” aren’t valid either.  
A legitimate English word that fits is **IGLUS** (a plural of iglu/igloo), but U has not been tested, and G has not been tested either. Checking the unused list, both G and U are still allowed.

Let me confirm:
I (position 1, allowed)  
G (unused, allowed)  
L (position 5, allowed)  
U (unused, allowed)  
S (position 4, fixed)

So **IGLUS** fits every rule.
