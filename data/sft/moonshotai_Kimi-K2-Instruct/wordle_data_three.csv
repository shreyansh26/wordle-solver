For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage.

- R: in the word but wrong position (-)

Consolidated information after three guesses:

1. Position 5 is fixed: E
2. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRANE, STORE, WRITE).  
   Therefore R must be in position 1.
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from STORE and WRITE).  
   Therefore T must be in position 3.

Current pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
R _ T _ E

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, S, O, W, I.

We still need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding any already listed).

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s try the common word “RUTTE” – but “RUTTE” repeats T, and position 3 already has T, so we can’t repeat letters unless the word allows it.

Another common word: “RHYME” – but H and Y are possible, but M needs checking.  
Wait, this might not fit.

Let’s try “ROUTE” – but O is ruled out.

A good candidate is “BROKE” – but O is ruled out.

How about “GRATE” – A is ruled out.

“BRUTE” – B, R, U, T, E.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage.

<guess>crane</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter must be E

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E and R is somewhere among positions 1-4.

Good letters so far: R (somewhere before last), E (fixed at end).
Bad letters: C, A, N.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- ends in E,
- contains R in a new spot (not position 2),
- avoids C, A, N,
- uses fresh common letters to test.

Candidate words:
- TIRED (T, I, R, E, D) – R in spot 3, new letters T, I, D.
- BRIEF (B, R, I, E, F) – R in spot 2 again (no new info), discard.
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) – R in spot 2 again, discard.
- STORE (S, T, O, R, E) – R in spot 4, new letters S, T, O.

STORE satisfies all conditions: ends with E, R now in position 4, introduces S, T, O.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:
1. Word ends in E (position 5 is ✓).
2. R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (both guesses placed R in 2 and 4 and got “-”).
3. Forbidden letters: C, A, N, S, O.
4. T is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 2).

So pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
R must be in position 1 or 3.  
T must be somewhere except position 2.  
Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E  
- Uses T and R in new positions  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, S, O)  

Candidate words:
- TRIPE – T in 1, R in 2 (R already marked bad in 2) → skip  
- URITE – U isn’t helpful, R in 3 (good), T in 2 (but T is known bad in 2) → skip  
- WRITE – W, R, I, T, E – R in 3 (good), T in 4 (good), uses fresh letters W, I.  
- TRITE – repeats T, uses I which we already have in TRIPE, but OK.  
- GRITE – G, R in 3, I, T in 4, E – but “GRITE” is not a common English word.

“WRITE” is common, satisfies all constraints, and introduces W, I.

Check:
- W → new test letter  
- R → position 3 (allowed)  
- I → new test letter  
- T → position 4 (allowed)  
- E → fixed at 5 (✓)

So WRITE is the best next guess.

Step-by-step deduction from all feedback:

1. Position 5 is definitely E (✓ every time).
2. R is present but has now received “-” feedback when placed in positions 2, 3 and 1.  
   Therefore R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … yet it must be somewhere.  
   The only remaining possibility is position 4.  
   → Pattern: _ _ _ R E
3. T is present but has received “-” when placed in positions 2 and 4.  
   With position 4 now occupied by R, T must be in position 1, 2 or 3.  
   Position 1 is open, position 2 is open, position 3 is open.

4. Letters already ruled out: B, C, A, N, S, O, W, I, U.
