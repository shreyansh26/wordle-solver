For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular opening words include ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in first position.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in second position.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in fifth position.

Useful facts:
- Letters that are definitely in the secret word: A, R, E
- Letters that are OUT: O, S
- A cannot be 1st, R cannot be 2nd, E cannot be 5th.

I need a 5-letter word containing A, R, E but excluding O and S, while respecting the positional restrictions.  
A good candidate uses all three confirmed letters and some fresh non-O/S letters.  
For example, “REACT” uses R, E, A plus C and T (new consonants) and moves A, R, E to different positions:
- R at start: allowed (only 2nd was forbidden)  
- E at 2nd: allowed (only 5th was forbidden)  
- A at 3rd: allowed (only 1st was forbidden)

No O or S appear, so this satisfies the constraints.

Reviewing the cumulative feedback:

- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in 3rd position.  
- C(-): C is in the word but NOT in 4th position.  
- T(x): T is NOT in the word.

So far we have:

- R must appear somewhere other than 1st or 2nd → possible 3rd, 4th, 5th.
- C is in the word but not 4th → possible 1st, 3rd, 5th.

Step-by-step deduction:

1. Letters confirmed in the word: C, E, A, R (from CLEAR feedback).
   - C is now known to be in position 1.
   - A is now known to be in position 4.
   - R is now known to be in position 5.
   - E is in the word (from earlier) but not in position 2 (from CLEAR: E(-)).

2. Letters known NOT in the word: O, S, T, L.

3. Positions so far determined:
   - Position 1: C
   - Position 2: unknown (must be E, but E is not allowed here from CLEAR feedback E(-))
   - Position 3: unknown
   - Position 4: A
   - Position 5: R

4. The word must be C _ _ A R, with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3, and position 2 cannot be E (from CLEAR feedback), so E must be in position 3.

   Thus, the word must be C E _ A R.

5. The missing letter is position 2, which must be a new letter (since we've confirmed C, E, A, R and ruled out O, S, T, L). Common remaining letters that fit: D, N, P, etc.

6. Valid words matching C _ E A R:
   - CEDAR (D is unused, fits all constraints)
   - Other options like CNEAR, CPEAR don't form valid English words.

""CEDAR"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- C in position 1 (✓ from CLEAR)
- E in position 2 (not forbidden, and must be here since position 3 is next)
- D new unused letter
- A in position 4 (✓ from CLEAR)
- R in position 5 (✓ from CLEAR)
