For a first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by including vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it uses five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should provide valuable feedback on multiple fronts.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x), R (x), O (x), E (x) → those four letters are not in the secret word at all.
- S (-) → the letter S is present in the word but not in the 4th position.

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining 20 letters, and the only thing we know so far is that an S exists somewhere other than the 4th position.

A good second guess should:
1. Include S in a different position.
2. Use five entirely new letters (none of A, R, O, E).
3. Pick common letters to gather maximum information.

Candidate words:  
- Using S in 1st position: SIGHT, STUMP, SLING, SWIFT, SHUNT  
- Using S in 2nd position: PSALM, USUAL (but repeats U), ISLET, ASSET (contains A and E, ruled out)  
- Using S in 3rd position: HASTY, BURST, MUSKY  
- Using S in 5th position: CLIPS, BLUSH, WHISK  

Among these, “SIGHT” uses very common consonants (G, H, T) plus I and S, and places S in the 1st position. It gives us a broad new set of letters to test while satisfying all constraints. 

Therefore, SIGHT is a strong next guess.

From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(x), S(-), E(x)  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere in the word, but is NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. SIGHT → S(✓), I(x), G(x), H(x), T(x)  
   ⇒ S is now confirmed in the first position.  
   ⇒ I, G, H, T are not in the word at all.

Thus the word starts with S, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T.

We need four more letters for positions 2-5. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Common remaining vowels: U and Y (Y can act as vowel here).

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency remaining letters to maximize information.  
Possible candidates:  
- SULKY (S, U, L, K, Y) – uses U, L, K, Y.  
- SUNKY (though K in 4th is unlikely to be a real word).

Therefore:
- Word form: S _ _ _ _

- Known absent letters: A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T, Y.
- Positions ruled out:

  – U: position 2 is wrong
  – L: position 3 is wrong
  – K: position 4 is wrong

Slots left: 2, 3, 4, 5. We know U, L, K must occupy three of these four slots (order unknown), and the remaining slot must be a new letter not yet tried.

Letters still unused and allowed (excluding the 9 known absent ones) include: B, C, D, F, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  Among these, common letters are B, C, D, F, M, N, P, W.

We need a real 5-letter word that starts with S, contains each of U, L, K exactly once, and one additional letter from the allowed set.

Candidates fitting these constraints:
- S L U C K → SLUCK – but this isn’t a valid English word.
- S L U N K → SLUNK – valid (past participle of slink).
- S P L U K – not valid.
- S C U L K – sculk is an obsolete spelling of skulk, not common.
- S L U N K seems the best valid choice.

Let’s verify positions:
- S(1) ✓
- L must not be in 3 – in SLUNK, L is in 2, OK.
- U must not be in 2 – in SLUNK, U is in 3, OK.
- K must not be in 4 – in SLUNK, K is in 5, OK.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by including vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it uses five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should provide valuable feedback on multiple fronts.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x), R (x), O (x), E (x) → those four letters are not in the secret word at all.
- S (-) → the letter S is present in the word but not in the 4th position.

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining 20 letters, and the only thing we know so far is that an S exists somewhere other than the 4th position.

A good second guess should:
1. Include S in a different position.
2. Use five entirely new letters (none of A, R, O, E).
3. Pick common letters to gather maximum information.

Candidate words:  
- Using S in 1st position: SIGHT, STUMP, SLING, SWIFT, SHUNT  
- Using S in 2nd position: PSALM, USUAL (but repeats U), ISLET, ASSET (contains A and E, ruled out)  
- Using S in 3rd position: HASTY, BURST, MUSKY  
- Using S in 5th position: CLIPS, BLUSH, WHISK  

Among these, “SIGHT” uses very common consonants (G, H, T) plus I and S, and places S in the 1st position. It gives us a broad new set of letters to test while satisfying all constraints. 

Therefore, SIGHT is a strong next guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(x), S(-), E(x)  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere in the word, but is NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. SIGHT → S(✓), I(x), G(x), H(x), T(x)  
   ⇒ S is now confirmed in the first position.  
   ⇒ I, G, H, T are not in the word at all.

Thus the word starts with S, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T.

We need four more letters for positions 2-5. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Common remaining vowels: U and Y (Y can act as vowel here).

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency remaining letters to maximize information.  
Possible candidates:  
- SULKY (S, U, L, K, Y) – uses U, L, K, Y.  
- SUNKY (though K in 4th is unlikely to be a real word).  
- SULKY is a valid English word.

So I’ll go with SULKY.

   – U is in pos 3 ✓.  
   – N absent.  
   – K is in the word, but not in pos 5 (since K(-) at pos 5 indicates it’s not correct there).

Now we know:
- Word: S _ U _ _ (since U is in pos 3)
- Letters that must appear: L and K (they are in the word, but we know their wrong positions)
- Letters absent: A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T, Y, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – S: only pos 1 ✓
  – U: only pos 3 ✓
  – L: not in pos 2 or 3 (pos 3 is U), so possible: 4 or 5
  – K: not in pos 4 or 5 (from SULKY and SLUNK), so possible: 2
- Only one slot left: positions 4 and 5 must contain L and K (but K cannot be in 4 or 5, so must be in 2. This forces L to be in 5 (since it can't be in 2,3,4).
- Therefore the form must be: S K U L _

But we need a 5-letter word that starts with SKUL and ends with a letter that hasn't been used yet (and is allowed). Allowed remaining letters (from unused, excluding absent ones): B, C, D, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The only valid word that fits SKUL? is ""SKULK"", but we already eliminated K being in pos 4 (it would be SKUL_, but that would require the last letter to be a new one). Wait:

Actually, the letters we know are:
S _ U _ _
We know K must be in the word, and it cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from SULKY and SLUNK), so K must be in position 2.
Similarly, L must be in the word and cannot be in positions 2,3 (pos 2 is K, pos 3 is U), and cannot be in position 4 (from SULKY), so L must be in position 5.
This leaves position 4 to be an unused letter from the allowed set.

So the word is: S K U _ L

Looking for 5-letter words SKUL_:
- SKULL (but ends with L, and we need L in pos 5, which would be SKUL L, but that would be SKULL, and we'd need 5 letters total, so it's SKUL L, but that would be 6 letters? No, SKULL is 5 letters: S K U L L. But L is already in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one L. This is not possible because L must be in pos 5.

Wait, this seems to imply the only possible word is SKULL, but that has L at pos 4 and 5, and we know L must appear exactly once in the word. This suggests a contradiction, meaning my reasoning might be off.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
From SLUNK:
- L is present but not in pos 2 (from SLUNK feedback L(-)).
- U is in pos 3 ✓.
- K is present but not in pos 5 (from SLUNK feedback K(-)).
From SULKY:
- K is present but not in pos 4 (from SULKY feedback K(-)).
So K cannot be in pos 4 or 5, so must be in pos 2.
Thus the word must be S K U _ _.
L must be in pos 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
But from SULKY, L is not in pos 3 (already U there), and from SLUNK L is not in pos 2.
So L could be in pos 4 or 5.

Now we have:
S K U _ _
And L must be in pos 4 or 5, and the remaining slot must be an allowed letter.
Possible words:
- SKULD (valid, means debt in Scots)
- SKULK (but K is already in pos 2, so this would be SKUL K, which seems invalid)
- SKULP (not a word)
- SKURL (not a word)

SKULD seems valid, but let's check if D has been used: D was not in any previous guess, so it's allowed.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is SKULD.

  – L: not in pos 2 or 3 (pos 3 is U), so possible: 4 or 5
  – K: not in pos 4 or 5 (from SULKY and SLUNK), so possible: 2
- Only one slot left: positions 4 and 5 must contain L and K (but K cannot be in 4 or 5, so must be in 2. This forces L to be in 5 (since it can't be in 2,3,4).
- Therefore the form must be: S K U L _

But we need a 5-letter word that starts with SKUL and ends with a letter that hasn't been used yet (and is allowed). Allowed remaining letters (from unused, excluding absent ones): B, C, D, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The only valid word that fits SKUL? is ""SKULK"", but we already eliminated K being in pos 4 (it would be SKUL_, but that would require the last letter to be a new one). Wait:

Actually, the letters we know are:
S _ U _ _
We know K must be in the word, and it cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from SULKY and SLUNK), so K must be in position 2.
Similarly, L must be in the word and cannot be in positions 2,3 (pos 2 is K, pos 3 is U), and cannot be in position 4 (from SULKY), so L must be in position 5.
This leaves position 4 to be an unused letter from the allowed set.

So the word is: S K U _ L

Looking for 5-letter words SKUL_:
- SKULL (but ends with L, and we need L in pos 5, which would be SKUL L, but that would be SKULL, and we'd need 5 letters total, so it's SKUL L, but that would be 6 letters? No, SKULL is 5 letters: S K U L L. But L is already in pos 4 and 5, but we only need one L. This is not possible because L must be in pos 5.

Wait, this seems to imply the only possible word is SKULL, but that has L at pos 4 and 5, and we know L must appear exactly once in the word. This suggests a contradiction, meaning my reasoning might be off.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
From SLUNK:
- L is present but not in pos 2 (from SLUNK feedback L(-)).
- U is in pos 3 ✓.
- K is present but not in pos 5 (from SLUNK feedback K(-)).
From SULKY:
- K is present but not in pos 4 (from SULKY feedback K(-)).
So K cannot be in pos 4 or 5, so must be in pos 2.
Thus the word must be S K U _ _.
L must be in pos 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
But from SULKY, L is not in pos 3 (already U there), and from SLUNK L is not in pos 2.
So L could be in pos 4 or 5.

Now we have:
S K U _ _
And L must be in pos 4 or 5, and the remaining slot must be an allowed letter.
Possible words:
- SKULD (valid, means debt in Scots)
- SKULK (but K is already in pos 2, so this would be SKUL K, which seems invalid)
- SKULP (not a word)
- SKURL (not a word)

SKULD seems valid, but let's check if D has been used: D was not in any previous guess, so it's allowed.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is SKULD.",Guess 5: SKULD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) D(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SKULL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by including vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it uses five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should provide valuable feedback on multiple fronts.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x), R (x), O (x), E (x) → those four letters are not in the secret word at all.
- S (-) → the letter S is present in the word but not in the 4th position.

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining 20 letters, and the only thing we know so far is that an S exists somewhere other than the 4th position.

A good second guess should:
1. Include S in a different position.
2. Use five entirely new letters (none of A, R, O, E).
3. Pick common letters to gather maximum information.

Candidate words:  
- Using S in 1st position: SIGHT, STUMP, SLING, SWIFT, SHUNT  
- Using S in 2nd position: PSALM, USUAL (but repeats U), ISLET, ASSET (contains A and E, ruled out)  
- Using S in 3rd position: HASTY, BURST, MUSKY  
- Using S in 5th position: CLIPS, BLUSH, WHISK  

Among these, “SIGHT” uses very common consonants (G, H, T) plus I and S, and places S in the 1st position. It gives us a broad new set of letters to test while satisfying all constraints. 

Therefore, SIGHT is a strong next guess.

<guess>SIGHT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SIGHT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(x), S(-), E(x)  
   ⇒ S exists somewhere in the word, but is NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. SIGHT → S(✓), I(x), G(x), H(x), T(x)  
   ⇒ S is now confirmed in the first position.  
   ⇒ I, G, H, T are not in the word at all.

Thus the word starts with S, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T.

We need four more letters for positions 2-5. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Common remaining vowels: U and Y (Y can act as vowel here).

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency remaining letters to maximize information.  
Possible candidates:  
- SULKY (S, U, L, K, Y) – uses U, L, K, Y.  
- SUNKY (though K in 4th is unlikely to be a real word).  
- SULKY is a valid English word.

So I’ll go with SULKY.

Guess 3: SULKY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints after three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(x), S(-), E(x)
   – S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4.

2. SIGHT → S(✓), I(x), G(x), H(x), T(x)
   – S is in position 1.
   – I, G, H, T are absent.

3. SULKY → S(✓), U(-), L(-), K(-), Y(x)
   – S is confirmed in position 1.
   – U, L, K are all present somewhere in the word but are not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
   – Y is absent.

Therefore:
- Word form: S _ _ _ _
- Letters used so far: S, U, L, K (all must appear somewhere in the word).
- Known absent letters: A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T, Y.
- Positions ruled out:
  – S: 2,3,4,5 (because it must be in position 1)
  – U: position 2 is wrong
  – L: position 3 is wrong
  – K: position 4 is wrong

Slots left: 2, 3, 4, 5. We know U, L, K must occupy three of these four slots (order unknown), and the remaining slot must be a new letter not yet tried.

Letters still unused and allowed (excluding the 9 known absent ones) include: B, C, D, F, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  Among these, common letters are B, C, D, F, M, N, P, W.

We need a real 5-letter word that starts with S, contains each of U, L, K exactly once, and one additional letter from the allowed set.

Candidates fitting these constraints:
- S L U C K → SLUCK – but this isn’t a valid English word.
- S L U N K → SLUNK – valid (past participle of slink).
- S P L U K – not valid.
- S C U L K – sculk is an obsolete spelling of skulk, not common.
- S L U N K seems the best valid choice.

Let’s verify positions:
- S(1) ✓
- L must not be in 3 – in SLUNK, L is in 2, OK.
- U must not be in 2 – in SLUNK, U is in 3, OK.
- K must not be in 4 – in SLUNK, K is in 5, OK.

So SLUNK satisfies all constraints.

   – S is confirmed in pos 1.  
   – I, G, H, T absent.

3. SULKY → S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x)  
   – S in pos 1 ✓.  
   – U, L, K are present but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

   – U is in pos 3 ✓.  
   – N absent.  
   – K is in the word, but not in pos 5 (since K(-) at pos 5 indicates it’s not correct there).

Now we know:
- Word: S _ U _ _ (since U is in pos 3)
- Letters that must appear: L and K (they are in the word, but we know their wrong positions)
- Letters absent: A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T, Y, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – S: only pos 1 ✓
  – U: only pos 3 ✓
  – L: not in pos 2 or 3 (pos 3 is U), so possible: 4 or 5
  – K: not in pos 4 or 5 (from SULKY and SLUNK), so possible: 2
- Only one slot left: positions 4 and 5 must contain L and K (but K cannot be in 4 or 5, so must be in 2. This forces L to be in 5 (since it can't be in 2,3,4).

But we need a 5-letter word that starts with SKUL and ends with a letter that hasn't been used yet (and is allowed). Allowed remaining letters (from unused, excluding absent ones): B, C, D, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

So the word is: S K U _ L

- U is in pos 3 ✓.
- K is present but not in pos 5 (from SLUNK feedback K(-)).
From SULKY:

So K cannot be in pos 4 or 5, so must be in pos 2.
Thus the word must be S K U _ _.
L must be in pos 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3).
But from SULKY, L is not in pos 3 (already U there), and from SLUNK L is not in pos 2.

SKULD seems valid, but let's check if D has been used: D was not in any previous guess, so it's allowed.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is SKULD.

From Guess 5 (SKULD):
S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) D(x)

So every letter except the last is now in its correct place:

S K U L _ 

The only remaining slot is position 5.  
All letters used so far that are confirmed in the word: S, K, U, L.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word (from previous feedback):  
A, R, O, E, I, G, H, T, Y, N, D.

The only common English letter not yet tested and still allowed is “F”.

The word that matches the pattern S K U L _ and is valid is “SKULF”, but that is not an English word.  
The actual English word that fits is “SKULK”, but we already saw K cannot be the last letter (K(-) in Guess 3 and 4).  

Wait, let’s re-express the confirmed positions:

S K U L _  (positions 1–4 are locked in).  
We still need a 5th letter.  From the excluded list, possible letters left are those not yet used and not ruled out:  
B, C, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with SKUL:  
- SKULK – but we have K already in position 2 and K(-) in position 5 in Guess 4, so K cannot be in 5.  
- SKULD – we just tried, D(x).  
- SKULP – not a recognized word.  
- The only remaining valid word is “SKULK”, but that would place K twice and contradict previous K(-) at the end.  

This indicates I must have made an error. Let’s re-express the constraints without assuming D(-) affects other positions.

Actually, the feedback S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) D(x) means:
- S in 1
- K in 2
- U in 3
- L in 4
- D in 5 is NOT in the word.

Thus the word is exactly S K U L _ with one remaining letter that is NOT D and also NOT any of the previously excluded letters. The only remaining valid English letter that makes a real word is “L” again, but we already have L in 4. There’s no common 5-letter word SKULL (which would be S K U L L) but that has two L’s and we know L appears only once.

Upon re-reading the feedback for Guess 5 carefully, it’s clear: positions 1-4 are correct. The fifth letter must be something new. The only real English word fitting S K U L _ is “SKULK”, but that would place K twice. However, “SKULK” is indeed a real word and uses K only once (positions 2 and 5). But we know from Guess 4 that K(-) at position 5 means K is NOT in position 5. Thus “SKULK” would violate this.

Realizing the constraints have boxed us in, and since all positions 1–4 are fixed and correct, the only possible letter left that would make a valid English word is **K** again, but that’s impossible because we already have K in position 2 and K(-) at position 5. This suggests the intended word must be **SKULK** despite the apparent contradiction, indicating a likely interpretation error.

However, strictly adhering to the feedback:

From Guess 5: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) D(x)  
Positions 1–4 are locked: S, K, U, L.  
Thus the word is “SKUL_” and the final letter must be something not yet excluded and forming a valid word. The only valid English word left is **SKULK**, but that would require K in position 5, which conflicts with K(-) in Guess 4. This implies there might be no other valid word, leading us to conclude the intended answer is **SKULK** and the previous K(-) might have been misinterpreted.

Re-examining the feedback chain shows the only remaining possible word is indeed **SKULK**. The K(-) in position 5 in Guess 4 simply confirmed K was not in that spot, but Guess 5 shows positions 1-4 are correct, leaving position 5 to be K, forming the valid word **SKULK**.

Thus the correct final guess is:
