For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and avoiding rare ones. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as test for the common consonants R and S.

Other strong first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced between vowels and consonants. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Therefore:
1. The word must contain the letter S, but S is NOT in position 4.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. The remaining letters we have not tested yet include common consonants like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc., and the vowels I, U, Y (since A, O, E are out).

A good next guess should:
- Include S in a different position (not 4).
- Avoid A, R, O, E.
- Preferably test more common consonants and the remaining vowels.

Possible next guesses: ""STING"", ""SLUMP"", ""SNICK"", ""DUSTY"", ""PLUSH"", etc.

One balanced option is ""STING"" because:
- Includes S (now in position 1, which is different from position 4 in AROSE).
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G while avoiding A, R, O, E.
- Tests the remaining vowel I and common consonants T, N, G.

Summary of current knowledge:

Letters known to be **absent**: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, Y
Letters known to be **present**:
- S is fixed in position 1.

From Guess 3 (SULKY):
- U, L, K are somewhere in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively.
- Y is absent.

Remaining untested letters that are still possible:
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Vowels: none left; the only remaining vowels were U and Y, and Y is now ruled out.  
  Therefore U must be the only vowel in the whole word (since A, O, E, I are already out).

Hence we are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Uses U exactly once, and U is **not** in position 2.
- Uses L and K exactly once each, and:
  – L is **not** in position 3.
  – K is **not** in position 4.
- All other letters must come from the still-allowed consonants listed above.

Positions to fill:
1: S (fixed)
2: any of the still-allowed consonants **except** U (U is a vowel and must appear only once).
3: any still-allowed consonant **except** L.
4: any still-allowed consonant **except** K.
5: any still-allowed consonant or U, subject to the above.

A systematic next guess should:
- Reuse the confirmed letters S.
- Place U in a new position (possible positions 3, 4, 5).
- Place L and K in new positions while respecting their exclusions.
- Fill the remaining spot(s) with as-yet-untested common consonants to gain maximum new information.

Among common consonants we have not tested yet are C, D, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s try:
Position 1: S
Position 2: C (new consonant)
Position 3: U (new position for U)
Position 4: L (valid because L is only excluded from position 3; position 4 is okay)
Position 5: K (valid because K is only excluded from position 4; position 5 is okay)

That yields “SCULK”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and avoiding rare ones. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help us quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as test for the common consonants R and S.

Other strong first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced between vowels and consonants. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Therefore:
1. The word must contain the letter S, but S is NOT in position 4.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. The remaining letters we have not tested yet include common consonants like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc., and the vowels I, U, Y (since A, O, E are out).

A good next guess should:
- Include S in a different position (not 4).
- Avoid A, R, O, E.
- Preferably test more common consonants and the remaining vowels.

Possible next guesses: ""STING"", ""SLUMP"", ""SNICK"", ""DUSTY"", ""PLUSH"", etc.

One balanced option is ""STING"" because:
- Includes S (now in position 1, which is different from position 4 in AROSE).
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G while avoiding A, R, O, E.
- Tests the remaining vowel I and common consonants T, N, G.

Let's try ""STING"".

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.
2. Letter S is in the word and is in the **first position**.

4. The remaining available consonants include B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
5. The only remaining vowels are U and Y (since A, O, E, I are ruled out).

To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Uses new, common letters we haven't tested yet.
- Includes at least one of the remaining vowels (U or Y) to find the vowel(s) in the word.

Possible candidates:
- SULKY (uses U, Y, L, K)
- SUCKY (uses U, C, K, Y)
- SEPLY (but E is ruled out)
- SLUMPY (too long)
- SURLY (uses U, R, L, Y - but R is ruled out from earlier feedback)
- SULKY seems best - uses U, L, K, Y (none of which have been ruled out).

Let’s distill what we know after every guess:

Known absent letters:  
A R O E T I N G Y C

Known present letters and their exact positions:  
S _ U L _

Known present letters and their forbidden positions:  
K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Word pattern so far:  
S _ U L _  (positions 2 and 5 are unknown)

Letters still unused and allowed:  
B D F H J M P Q V W X Z (plus K, which must appear somewhere)

Position 2 can be any of these allowed consonants.  
Position 5 can be any of these allowed consonants, but **must not** be K (because K is already in position 4 in SCULK and we know K is NOT in position 5).  
Therefore K must occupy position 4, but position 4 is already L. This implies our deduction must be wrong.

Wait — feedback on SCULK shows:
- K(-) means K is in the word but NOT in position 5, so K must occupy one of positions 2 or 3 or 4. 
We already have:
- pos 3 = U (fixed ✓)
- pos 4 = L (fixed ✓)
So K must be in position 2.

Thus the only possible word structure is:
S K U L _

Position 5 must be an unused consonant that has not been ruled out.  
Available consonants: B D F H J M P Q V W X Z

We have only one slot left to fill.  
Among the remaining letters, common ones are B, D, F, H, M, P.

Let’s pick a common consonant we have not tested yet.  
Let’s try B.

Candidate: SKULB — but that’s not a valid English word.  
SKULD — valid in Old-English/Scandinavian, but not a standard English word.  
SKULF — not a word.  
SKULK — yes, that’s a valid English word and matches every constraint:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- K ✓ pos 2  
- U ✓ pos 3  
- L ✓ pos 4  
- K appears only once (position 2 already has K, so this is impossible).  
Oops! That would need two K’s. So SKULK is invalid.

We need to keep K in position 2, and we can’t have another K in position 5.

Next common consonant: D.

SKULD — not a standard English word.  
SKULM — not a word.  
SKULP — not a word.  
SKULF — not a word.  
SKULH — not a word.  
SKULV — not a word.

Next: M.

SKULM — not a word.  
SKULB — no.  
SKULF — no.  
SKULW — no.  
SKULJ — no.

Next: F.

SKULF — not a word.

Next: H.

SKULH — not a word.

Next: P.

SKULP — not a word.

Next: D.

SKULD — again, not standard.

Next: B.

SKULB — not a word.

Hmm. Let’s re-examine the structure.

Actually, the feedback on SCULK showed:
- S(✓) C(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)  
That explicitly fixes:  
S _ U L _  

and K is in the word, not in position 5, so K must be in position 2.

Therefore the word must be S K U L _.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is **SKULK** — but that repeats K, which we cannot do because we’ve already confirmed K is present once.  
Wait — SKULK has K in both positions 2 and 5, which would be disallowed since we know K is only present once. Thus SKULK is impossible.

Another candidate: **SKULP** — not a word.  
**SKULB** — not.  
**SKULF** — not.  
**SKULS** — not.  
**SKULY** — Y is already ruled out.  
**SKULD** — not standard.

But the only remaining consonants are B D F H J M P Q V W X Z, none of which seem to form a standard 5-letter English word ending in SKUL?.

Realizing I misread the pattern! The word must start with S, have U in position 3, L in position 4, and K in position 2. Thus the only possible word is S K U L _.

The valid English word fitting S K U L _ is **SKULL**.

Let’s verify:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- K ✓ pos 2  
- U ✓ pos 3  
- L ✓ pos 4  
- L is allowed to repeat because we never received exclusion for L in position 5.  
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore the word is SKULL.

Therefore K must occupy position 4, but position 4 is already L. This implies our deduction must be wrong.

Wait — feedback on SCULK shows:
- K(-) means K is in the word but NOT in position 5, so K must occupy one of positions 2 or 3 or 4. 
We already have:
- pos 3 = U (fixed ✓)
- pos 4 = L (fixed ✓)
So K must be in position 2.

Thus the only possible word structure is:
S K U L _

Position 5 must be an unused consonant that has not been ruled out.  
Available consonants: B D F H J M P Q V W X Z

We have only one slot left to fill.  
Among the remaining letters, common ones are B, D, F, H, M, P.

Let’s pick a common consonant we have not tested yet.  
Let’s try B.

Candidate: SKULB — but that’s not a valid English word.  
SKULD — valid in Old-English/Scandinavian, but not a standard English word.  
SKULF — not a word.  
SKULK — yes, that’s a valid English word and matches every constraint:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- K ✓ pos 2  
- U ✓ pos 3  
- L ✓ pos 4  
- K appears only once (position 2 already has K, so this is impossible).  
Oops! That would need two K’s. So SKULK is invalid.

We need to keep K in position 2, and we can’t have another K in position 5.

Next common consonant: D.

SKULD — not a standard English word.  
SKULM — not a word.  
SKULP — not a word.  
SKULF — not a word.  
SKULH — not a word.  
SKULV — not a word.

Next: M.

SKULM — not a word.  
SKULB — no.  
SKULF — no.  
SKULW — no.  
SKULJ — no.

Next: F.

SKULF — not a word.

Next: H.

SKULH — not a word.

Next: P.

SKULP — not a word.

Next: D.

SKULD — again, not standard.

Next: B.

SKULB — not a word.

Hmm. Let’s re-examine the structure.

Actually, the feedback on SCULK showed:
- S(✓) C(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)  
That explicitly fixes:  
S _ U L _  

and K is in the word, not in position 5, so K must be in position 2.

Therefore the word must be S K U L _.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is **SKULK** — but that repeats K, which we cannot do because we’ve already confirmed K is present once.  
Wait — SKULK has K in both positions 2 and 5, which would be disallowed since we know K is only present once. Thus SKULK is impossible.

Another candidate: **SKULP** — not a word.  
**SKULB** — not.  
**SKULF** — not.  
**SKULS** — not.  
**SKULY** — Y is already ruled out.  
**SKULD** — not standard.

But the only remaining consonants are B D F H J M P Q V W X Z, none of which seem to form a standard 5-letter English word ending in SKUL?.

Realizing I misread the pattern! The word must start with S, have U in position 3, L in position 4, and K in position 2. Thus the only possible word is S K U L _.

The valid English word fitting S K U L _ is **SKULL**.

Let’s verify:
- S ✓ pos 1  
- K ✓ pos 2  
- U ✓ pos 3  
- L ✓ pos 4  
- L is allowed to repeat because we never received exclusion for L in position 5.  
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore the word is SKULL.",Guess 5: SKULL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
