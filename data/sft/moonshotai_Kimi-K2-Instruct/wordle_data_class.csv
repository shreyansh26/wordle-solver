Since this is the first guess without any prior feedback, the best strategy is to choose a word that includes common letters in English 5-letter words to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and I are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

Feedback summary:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position. So the word ends with S.
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word is _ _ _ _ S and contains the letter A somewhere in positions 2-4, with no R, O, or E.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, I, Y.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to appear and E is ruled out).

A balanced 5-letter word that incorporates S at the end and tests several new frequent letters is “STAID”. It satisfies:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Includes A (somewhere other than position 1).
- Uses common consonants T, D and the vowel I.
- Avoids R, O, E.

Updated deductions after Guess 2 (STAID):

1. S is confirmed in the secret word, but it is NOT in position 1 (STAID feedback showed S as “-”).
   Combined with Guess 1 (AROSE) showing S as “✓” in position 5, this confirms S is definitely **position 5**.

2. A is in the word and **position 3** (A got “✓” in STAID).

3. T, I, D are not in the word.

4. R, O, E are also not in the word (from Guess 1).

So the pattern so far:
_ _ A _ S

Letters still available to try:
- Vowels: U, Y (and A already used in position 3)
- Common consonants left: N, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, W

We now need two consonants/letters for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 4.

Popular consonants to test: C, L, N, G, M, P, B.

A good next guess should test new positions and letters. Let’s choose a word that fits _ _ A _ S and uses common unused letters.

Candidate: “CLANS”
- C, L, N are all new letters.
- Ends with S (position 5), A in position 3.
- Valid 5-letter word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,class,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and I are good choices. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position. So the word ends with S.
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word is _ _ _ _ S and contains the letter A somewhere in positions 2-4, with no R, O, or E.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, I, Y.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to appear and E is ruled out).

A balanced 5-letter word that incorporates S at the end and tests several new frequent letters is “STAID”. It satisfies:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Includes A (somewhere other than position 1).
- Uses common consonants T, D and the vowel I.
- Avoids R, O, E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated deductions after Guess 2 (STAID):

1. S is confirmed in the secret word, but it is NOT in position 1 (STAID feedback showed S as “-”).
   Combined with Guess 1 (AROSE) showing S as “✓” in position 5, this confirms S is definitely **position 5**.

2. A is in the word and **position 3** (A got “✓” in STAID).

3. T, I, D are not in the word.

4. R, O, E are also not in the word (from Guess 1).

So the pattern so far:
_ _ A _ S

Letters still available to try:
- Vowels: U, Y (and A already used in position 3)
- Common consonants left: N, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, W

We now need two consonants/letters for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 4.

Popular consonants to test: C, L, N, G, M, P, B.

A good next guess should test new positions and letters. Let’s choose a word that fits _ _ A _ S and uses common unused letters.

Candidate: “CLANS”
- C, L, N are all new letters.
- Ends with S (position 5), A in position 3.

From the feedback so far:

2. A is confirmed in position 3 (from Guess 2 and still consistent).
3. C, L, A, S are all confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.
4. The only missing letter is position 4. From the previous guesses, the letters tried and ruled out are:
   - From Guess 4: P is not in position 4.
   - From Guess 3: N is not in position 4.
   - From earlier: R, O, E, T, I, D are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is: C L A _ S, and the missing letter (position 4) must be from the remaining unused consonants.

Remaining unused consonants that fit and are common in English: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words matching ""CLA _ S"":
- CLABS – Not a valid word.
- CLADS – D is ruled out (from STAID feedback).
- CLAFS – Not valid.
- CLAGS – G is possible; ""clags"" is valid (British slang for mud or dirt).
- CLAMS – M is possible; ""clams"" is valid.
- CLAWS – W is possible; ""claws"" is valid.
- CLAYS – Y is possible; ""clays"" is valid.

Among these, ""CLAMS"" and ""CLAWS"" and ""CLAYS"" are the most common. ""CLAMS"" seems like a good guess since M hasn't been tested yet.

But actually, from Guess 4 (CLAPS), P is ruled out, and from Guess 3 (CLANS), N is ruled out. So the correct word must be one of the remaining options.

Looking at the remaining possibilities:
- CLAGS – Valid but less common.
- CLAMS – Valid and common.
- CLAWS – Valid and common.
- CLAYS – Valid and common.

Given that M, W, and Y are still possible, but we need to pick one. ""CLAMS"" is a straightforward choice.

However, let me think if there's a more systematic way. The remaining consonants for position 4 are: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y.

Valid words:
- CLAMS (M)
- CLAWS (W)
- CLAYS (Y)
- CLAGS (G)
- CLACH (H, but Scottish, less common)
- CLANK (K, but N is already ruled out)
- CLABBER (B, but not 5 letters)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We now have:

C L A _ S  
with position 4 ruled out for: N, P, M, R, O, E, T, I, D.

That leaves unused consonants: B, F, G, H, K, W, Y.

Valid 5-letter English words fitting CLA_ S:
- CLABS – not a recognized word  
- CLACK – ends with K, but we need S at the end  
- CLAD_ – D is out  
- CLAGS – G is possible  
- CLAHS – not a word  
- CLAKS – not a word  
- CLAWS – W is possible  
- CLAYS – Y is possible  

So the remaining valid, common candidates are CLAGS, CLAWS, CLAYS.

CLAWS and CLAYS are both common, but let’s pick CLAWS first since W is highly frequent in this position.

(If CLAWS fails, CLAYS will be the obvious next choice.)
