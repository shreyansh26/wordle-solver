For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Some excellent starting words are:
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ""RAISE"" (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, and E. These letters cover both common vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

We need:  
- A in position 5.  
- Must include L and O.  
- No S, T, E, F, R.

Possible 5-letter common words ending in A with L and O:

- _ O L _ A → e.g., BOLLA (invalid)  
- _ _ O L A → e.g., MOOLA (contains O, L, ends in A, no forbidden letters)  

""MOOLA"" is slang for money, but acceptable. Another is ""KOALA"" but it’s name.  

""KOALA"" is the most straightforward:  
- K in 1, O in 2, A in 3, L in 4, A in 5 → but A in 3 conflicts with A in 5 (word is 5-letter).  

Wait, KOALA is K-O-A-L-A (5 letters), but A is already in position 5, so A cannot also be in 3. Thus KOALA is invalid.

Another: ""GOLLA"" – but G-O-L-L-A is invalid (double L).  

""BOGLA"" – not a word.  

""COALA"" – archaic variant, but not common.  

""POLKA"" – contains R? No, P-O-L-K-A.

One solid word that fits is “FLORA”:
- It has L and A.
- It does not have S, T, or E.
- L is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 5 (allowed).

Another candidate could be “PLANK” or “CAROL”, but “FLORA” is very common and covers F, R, O—frequently occurring letters.

We need a 5-letter word ending in A, containing L and O, avoiding S, T, E, F, R.

Candidate positions:  
_ _ _ _ A  
with L not in pos 2 and O not in pos 3.

Good possible letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:  
- GLOAM (but M is uncommon)  
- COBAL (not common)

- COPAL (obscure)  
- VOCLA (not a word)  
- BOLAR (contains R, ruled out)  
- POLAR (contains R, ruled out)  
- LOPAL (not a word)  

A very common word that fits is “COBAL” but that’s obscure. Instead, let’s try “MOLAR” – but R is ruled out.  
Wait, let’s think systematically:

We need:  
- A in position 5.  
- Must include L and O.  
- No S, T, E, F, R.

Possible 5-letter common words ending in A with L and O:  
- L and O could be in positions 1-4.  

Let’s list possibilities:  
- O _ L _ A (O not in 3, L not in 2) → e.g., OLLLA (invalid)  
- _ O L _ A → e.g., BOLLA (invalid)  
- _ _ O L A → e.g., MOOLA (contains O, L, ends in A, no forbidden letters)  

""MOOLA"" is slang for money, but acceptable. Another is ""KOALA"" but it’s name.  

""KOALA"" is the most straightforward:  
- K in 1, O in 2, A in 3, L in 4, A in 5 → but A in 3 conflicts with A in 5 (word is 5-letter).  

Wait, KOALA is K-O-A-L-A (5 letters), but A is already in position 5, so A cannot also be in 3. Thus KOALA is invalid.

Another: ""GOLLA"" – but G-O-L-L-A is invalid (double L).  

""BOGLA"" – not a word.  

""COALA"" – archaic variant, but not common.  

""POLKA"" – contains R? No, P-O-L-K-A.  
- P, O, L, K, A – all allowed, and fits constraints:

  - L not in 2 ✓ (L is in 3)  
  - O not in 3 ✓ (O is in 2)

Summary of what we now know:

Letters in the word and their states  
- A: must be in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and 3).  
- O: must be in position 2 (✓ from Guess 3).  
- L: is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 3).

Letters ruled out completely  
S, T, E, F, R, P, K.

So the secret word looks like:  
_ O _ _ A  
with an L somewhere in the 1st, 4th (or 5th, but 5th is A) positions.  
Therefore L must be in position 1 or 4.

Remaining legal letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, G, H, I, M, N, U, V, W, Y, plus L we already know is present.

We need a common 5-letter word that matches  
[?] O [?] [?] A  
and contains L exactly once (and not in position 3).

Possible patterns:
1. L O _ _ A → but L would be in position 1 (allowed).  
   Example: LOBIA – uncommon.  
2. _ O _ L A → L in position 4 (allowed).  
   Example: C O B L A – not a word.  
   Example: M O D L A – not a word.  
   Example: M O L L A – L repeats, and duplicate L may or may not be allowed, but it’s obscure.  
   Example: M O N L A – not a word.  
   Example: C O M L A – not a word.  
   Example: G O N L A – not a word.  

Looking at common English words, one that fits is “COBIA” (a fish) but it has no L.  
Another candidate: “GONIA” (plural of gonion, an anatomical term) – again no L.  
A better fit: “MODEL” – but ends with L, not A.  

Wait, let’s list all common _ O _ _ A words that include L once, L not in 3, and only use allowed letters.

- B O L L A – double L, obscure.  
- C O L L A – obscure.  
- D O L L A – obscure.  
- J O L L A – obscure.  
- M O L L A – obscure.  
- N O L L A – obscure.  
- B O L A _ – but must be 5 letters ending in A.  
- H O L L A – uncommon spelling.  
- B O L A S – ends in S (forbidden).  

It seems no extremely common word matches. However, “COBOL” is a programming language but ends with L, not A.  

Another systematic approach:  
The only positions left to fill are 1, 3, 4. We know:  
- O is pos 2, A is pos 5.  
- L must be in pos 1 or 4.  

Case 1: L in pos 1  
Word form: L O _ _ A  
Remaining letters: must be from allowed set and cannot include any forbidden.  
Possible: L O C A A – invalid (double A).  
L O C I A – “LOC IA” not a word.  
L O D I A – not a word.  
L O G I A – “LOGIA” plural of logion, relatively obscure but acceptable; contains G, O, L, I, A.  

Case 2: L in pos 4  
Word form: _ O _ L A  
Possible:  
B O D L A – not a word.  
C O D L A – not a word.  
D O G L A – not a word.  
M O D L A – not a word.  
M O G L A – not a word.  
V O G L A – not a word.  
C O M L A – not a word.  

Among these, “LOGIA” is the only dictionary-valid candidate that is reasonably known (though slightly technical).  

Therefore, I’ll guess LOGIA.

and contains L exactly once (and not in position 3).

Possible patterns:
1. L O _ _ A → but L would be in position 1 (allowed).  
   Example: LOBIA – uncommon.  
2. _ O _ L A → L in position 4 (allowed).  
   Example: C O B L A – not a word.  
   Example: M O D L A – not a word.  
   Example: M O L L A – L repeats, and duplicate L may or may not be allowed, but it’s obscure.  
   Example: M O N L A – not a word.  
   Example: C O M L A – not a word.  
   Example: G O N L A – not a word.  

Looking at common English words, one that fits is “COBIA” (a fish) but it has no L.  
Another candidate: “GONIA” (plural of gonion, an anatomical term) – again no L.  
A better fit: “MODEL” – but ends with L, not A.  

Wait, let’s list all common _ O _ _ A words that include L once, L not in 3, and only use allowed letters.

- B O L L A – double L, obscure.  
- C O L L A – obscure.  
- D O L L A – obscure.  
- J O L L A – obscure.  
- M O L L A – obscure.  
- N O L L A – obscure.  
- B O L A _ – but must be 5 letters ending in A.  
- H O L L A – uncommon spelling.  
- B O L A S – ends in S (forbidden).  

It seems no extremely common word matches. However, “COBOL” is a programming language but ends with L, not A.  

Another systematic approach:  
The only positions left to fill are 1, 3, 4. We know:  
- O is pos 2, A is pos 5.  
- L must be in pos 1 or 4.  

Case 1: L in pos 1  
Word form: L O _ _ A  
Remaining letters: must be from allowed set and cannot include any forbidden.  
Possible: L O C A A – invalid (double A).  
L O C I A – “LOC IA” not a word.  
L O D I A – not a word.  
L O G I A – “LOGIA” plural of logion, relatively obscure but acceptable; contains G, O, L, I, A.  

Case 2: L in pos 4  
Word form: _ O _ L A  
Possible:  
B O D L A – not a word.  
C O D L A – not a word.  
D O G L A – not a word.  
M O D L A – not a word.  
M O G L A – not a word.  
V O G L A – not a word.  
C O M L A – not a word.  

Among these, “LOGIA” is the only dictionary-valid candidate that is reasonably known (though slightly technical).  

Therefore, I’ll guess LOGIA.
