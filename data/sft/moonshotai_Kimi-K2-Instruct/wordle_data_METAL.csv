Since this is the first guess, we have no information about the secret word. The best strategy for an initial guess is to use a word that contains common letters and gives us maximum information. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, N, L).

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E (giving us information about vowel positions)
- 2 common consonants: R, S (helping identify consonant positions)

This word provides a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback.

From the feedback on “AROSE”:

A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1  
R(x) – R does not appear anywhere  
O(x) – O does not appear anywhere  
S(x) – S does not appear anywhere  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- Required letters: A, E  
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S  
- Positions 1 and 5 cannot contain A and E respectively.  
- Positions 2, 3, 4 are still completely open (except they cannot be R, O, S).  

Good next choices should:
1. Place A and E in new positions.  
2. Bring in other common letters not yet tested.  
3. Avoid R, O, S.  

Common unused letters: T, I, N, L, C, M, P, H, etc.

A word that uses A and E in new spots and introduces strong new consonants is “HEART”.  
But H and T are fine and untested, and E and A are repositioned.  
However H is not as common as other consonants, and we still need more info.

Another strong candidate is “PLATE” – P, L, T are common, A and E are repositioned, and we avoid forbidden letters.  
But E is still at the end, which was position 5 and failed for AROSE; E must not be at the end, so “PLATE” keeps E in position 5 – bad.

To keep E away from position 5, consider “LEAPT”.  
This uses P and T, keeps E at position 2, A at position 4.  Letters used: L, E, A, P, T. None are forbidden.

But L is not the strongest consonant to test, and P is less common than T or N.

“EATEN” uses E twice – not optimal, as it repeats E early.

“NEATH” – N, E, A, T, H.  Still uses H which is less common.

“MEANT” – M, E, A, N, T.  All strong, common letters, no repeats, no forbidden letters, A and E are repositioned (E in 2, A in 3).

This seems optimal.

So my next guess: MEANT
