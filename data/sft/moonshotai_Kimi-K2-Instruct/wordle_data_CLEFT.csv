1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Looking at the top common letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This covers 5 different high-frequency letters (3 consonants, 2 vowels) that appear in many 5-letter words. The feedback from this guess will tell us which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions, helping us eliminate many possibilities right away.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, or S.
- Still needs four other distinct letters plus the E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Because we’ve ruled out four very common letters (R, A, I, S), we should look for a word that:
- Uses E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Avoids R, A, I, S entirely.
- Introduces several new high-frequency consonants like T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “TONEY”:
- T, O, N, Y are all new letters (not ruled out yet).
- E is shifted to position 4 (different from position 5 in RAISE).
- If any of T, O, N, Y are present, we’ll get positional information; if they’re not, we’ll mark them out quickly.

From these constraints:
