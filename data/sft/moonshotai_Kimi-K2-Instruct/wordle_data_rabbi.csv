For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

A classic and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) which are frequently in English words

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but wrong position (position 1).
- R is in the word but wrong position (position 2).
- O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Letters to use: A and R (but positions 1 and 2 are wrong for them).
- Letters to avoid: O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses both A and R.
2. Does **not** use O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

Check:
- T: allowed (not O, S, E)
- R: allowed, not in position 2 (here it's position 2, but feedback says R is in the word but wrong position (originally position 2), so position 2 is confirmed wrong for R. ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 → violates the feedback. Bad choice.

Alternative: ""DRAIN""
- D: allowed
- R: position 2 → still bad.

- Contains O → avoid.

Alternative: ""RAFTY""
- Contains E? No. O? No. S? No.
- R in position 1: original was position 2, so this is new position (allowed).

2. Letters to exclude: O, S, E, N, C, H
3. Word pattern so far: R A _ _ _

We still need three more letters for the remaining three positions (3, 4, 5). The allowed letters are all letters except O, S, E, N, C, H. That leaves us with: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to maximize information. Good candidates are: I, T, L, D, M, G, B.

We need to form a 5-letter word starting with ""RA"" and using only allowed letters for the last three positions. Possible combinations:
- R A I D _ (but need 5 letters)
- R A I T ? (RAIT_ - not common)
- R A B I D (valid word: RABID, but A is already confirmed in position 2)
- R A T I O (contains O - excluded)
- R A D I O (contains O - excluded)
- R A I S E (contains S, E - excluded)
- R A I L S (contains S - excluded)
- R A D I I (not valid)
- R A M I D (not standard)
- R A P I D (P is allowed, I is allowed, D is allowed - and it's a common word)

""RAPID"" fits perfectly:
- Starts with RA (confirmed positions)
- Uses P, I, D which are all allowed (not in the excluded list)
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

Recap of what we know so far:

1. R is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. Letters to exclude: O, S, E, N, C, H, P, D.
4. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong place:
   - A was in wrong place in guess 1 (now confirmed in place 2, so this is satisfied).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4 (from rapid: I(-)).

So the word pattern is: R A _ I _ or R A _ _ I (since I is in the word but not at position 4).

Remaining allowed letters (excluding the excluded ones): B, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits R A _ I _ or R A _ _ I.

Let's try R A I _ _ first since I must be in the word - but R A I _ _ would have I in position 3, which is not restricted yet. But from rapid, I is not in position 4, but could be in 3 or 5.

Looking for common words:
- R A I N Y (but N is excluded)
- R A B I D (D is excluded)
- R A I L S (S is excluded)
- R A V I N (N is excluded)
- R A I K S (S is excluded)
- R A I K U (not a word)
- R A I T A (not common)
- R A I K E (E is excluded)

Let's try I in position 5: R A _ _ I.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed list: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:
- R A M B I (valid)
- R A G B I (not standard)
- R A B B I (valid: RABBI, but A is in position 2, word starts with RA)
- R A T B I (not a word)
- R A K I (only 4 letters)
- R A M M I (valid: RAMMI, but not common)
- R A T I (only 4 letters)
- R A M I (only 4 letters)

Actually, looking at common words:
- R A M B I is 6 letters.
- R A B B I is 5 letters but A is in position 2, so R A B B I - but this would be R A B B I, which is not correct because the word is R A B B I, but position 3 would be B, 4 would be B, 5 would be I.

But R A B B I seems valid: R A B B I.

Check:
- R in position 1: ✓
- A in position 2: ✓
- B: allowed (not in excluded list)
- B: allowed
- I: in word but not at position 4 (here at 5, so allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: R A M I (only 4 letters)
R A T I O (O is excluded)

Actually, the only common 5-letter word I can think of fitting R A _ _ I is R A B B I.
