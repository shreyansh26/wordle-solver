For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me a good chance of getting some hits to narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

Good starting words often include:
- A combination of vowels and consonants
- Common consonants like R, S, T
- At least one vowel

Some good candidates are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers many common letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word
- R(-) – R is in the word, but in a different position (position 2)
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- S(x) – S is not in the word
- E(x) – E is not in the word

Known facts:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It also contains an R, but not in position 2.
- It does not contain A, S, or E.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with R present somewhere else.

Letters to try next: common consonants that haven’t been used yet, plus the vowels I and U (since A, O, E have been tried).

Good candidates:
- Introduce T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
- Avoid repeating R in position 2.
- Ensure R appears in a different spot.

Let’s try “FRONT”:
- F, R, N, T are common consonants.
- R is in position 2 here (but feedback said R is not in position 2), so this is invalid.

Try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P – but O is already in position 3, and R in position 2 is invalid.

Try “DROIT”:
- D, R, O, I, T – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “CROON”:
- C, R, O, O, N – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – R in position 1, O in position 2 (but O must be in position 3), so invalid.

Try “MORON”:
- M, O, R, O, N – O is in position 2 (invalid), R in position 3 (invalid).

Try “BROWN”:
- B, R, O, W, N – O is in position 3 (correct), R is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PROUD”:
- P, R, O, U, D – O is in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “ORBIT”:
- O, R, B, I, T – O in position 1 (invalid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “WROTH”:
- W, R, O, T, H – R in position 2 (invalid), O in position 3 (correct), but R is in position 2 (invalid).

I need a word where:
- O is in position 3.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- No A, S, E.

Possible pattern: _ _ O _ _ with R in 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidates:
- “FROWN” – but O is in position 2 (invalid).
- “GROOM” – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).
- “TROOP” – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 1 (valid).

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 1 (valid), no A/S/E, and letters T, P are new test letters.

But it has two O’s, which might not be efficient. Also, double O is unlikely.

Alternative: “GROUP”:
- G, R, O, U, P – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Invalid.

Try “FROND”:
- F, R, O, N, D – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

- C, R, O, W, D – same issue.

Try “BROWN”:
- B, R, O, W, N – same issue.

Try “FRONT”:
- F, R, O, N, T – same issue.

It seems many good candidates have R in position 2, which is invalid. I need to move R away.

Let’s try “BROOK”:
- B, R, O, O, K – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Still stuck.

Alternative approach: list words with O in position 3 and R elsewhere:

“CHORD” – C, H, O, R, D – O in position 3, R in position 4 (valid).
“THORN” – T, H, O, R, N – O in position 3, R in position 4 (valid).
“AROMA” – has A (invalid).
“PROUD” – has R in position 2 (invalid).
“GROAN” – has A (invalid).
“CROSS” – has S (invalid).
“PROOF” – R in position 2 (invalid).
“TROOP” – R in position 1 (valid), O in position 3 (valid), no A/S/E.

“TROOP” seems best so far: T, R, O, O, P – but double O.

“THORN” is better: T, H, O, R, N – covers new letters H, N.

Let’s use “THORN”.

“THORN” – T, H, O, R, N – O in position 3, R in position 4 (valid).
“AROMA” – has A (invalid).
“PROUD” – has R in position 2 (invalid).
“GROAN” – has A (invalid).
“CROSS” – has S (invalid).
“PROOF” – R in position 2 (invalid).
“TROOP” – R in position 1 (valid), O in position 3 (valid), no A/S/E.

“TROOP” seems best so far: T, R, O, O, P – but double O.

“THORN” is better: T, H, O, R, N – covers new letters H, N.

Let’s use “THORN”.Based on the feedback, the secret word has:
- O in position 3.
- R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- No A, S, or E.

A good next guess that satisfies these constraints and tests additional common letters is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

Good starting words often include:
- A combination of vowels and consonants
- Common consonants like R, S, T
- At least one vowel

Some good candidates are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers many common letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

- A(x) – A is not in the word

- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- S(x) – S is not in the word
- E(x) – E is not in the word

Known facts:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It also contains an R, but not in position 2.
- It does not contain A, S, or E.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _ with R present somewhere else.

Letters to try next: common consonants that haven’t been used yet, plus the vowels I and U (since A, O, E have been tried).

Good candidates:
- Introduce T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
- Avoid repeating R in position 2.
- Ensure R appears in a different spot.

Let’s try “FRONT”:
- F, R, N, T are common consonants.
- R is in position 2 here (but feedback said R is not in position 2), so this is invalid.

Try “BROWN”:

Try “GROIN”:
- G, R, O, I, N – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PROUD”:
- P, R, O, U, D – O is in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “ORBIT”:

Try “WORLD”:
- W, O, R, L, D – O in position 2 (invalid), R in position 3 (invalid).

Try “FORTH”:
- F, O, R, T, H – O in position 2 (invalid), R in position 3 (invalid).

Try “NORTH”:
- N, O, R, T, H – same issue.

Try “ROBIN”:
- R, O, B, I, N – O in position 2 (invalid), R in position 1 (possible), but O must be in position 3.

Try “CORNY”:
- C, O, R, N, Y – O in position 2 (invalid), R in position 3 (invalid).

Try “MORPH”:
- M, O, R, P, H – same issue.

Try “WROTH”:
- W, R, O, T, H – R in position 2 (invalid), O in position 3 (correct), but R is in position 2 (invalid).

I need a word where:
- O is in position 3.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- No A, S, E.

Possible pattern: _ _ O _ _ with R in 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidates:
- “FROWN” – but O is in position 2 (invalid).
- “GROOM” – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).
- “TROOP” – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 1 (valid).

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T, R, O, O, P – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 1 (valid), no A/S/E, and letters T, P are new test letters.

But it has two O’s, which might not be efficient. Also, double O is unlikely.

Alternative: “GROUP”:

Invalid.

Try “FROND”:

It seems many good candidates have R in position 2, which is invalid. I need to move R away.

Let’s try “BROOK”:
- B, R, O, O, K – O in position 3 (correct), R in position 2 (invalid).

Still stuck.

Alternative approach: list words with O in position 3 and R elsewhere:

“CHORD” – C, H, O, R, D – O in position 3, R in position 4 (valid).
“THORN” – T, H, O, R, N – O in position 3, R in position 4 (valid).
“AROMA” – has A (invalid).
“PROUD” – has R in position 2 (invalid).
“GROAN” – has A (invalid).
“CROSS” – has S (invalid).
“PROOF” – R in position 2 (invalid).
“TROOP” – R in position 1 (valid), O in position 3 (valid), no A/S/E.

“TROOP” seems best so far: T, R, O, O, P – but double O.

“THORN” is better: T, H, O, R, N – covers new letters H, N.

Let’s use “THORN”.Based on the feedback, the secret word has:
- O in position 3.
- R somewhere, but not in position 2.

From the new feedback on HUMOR:

H(-) – H is in the word but not in position 1  
U(x) – U is not in the word  
M(x) – M is not in the word  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 5 (we already knew it’s in position 3, so this is consistent)  
R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So far we have:

Position pattern: _ _ O _ R  
Letters contained: O (fixed at 3), R (fixed at 5), H (somewhere in 2,3,4; 3 is O, so H must be in 2 or 4)  
Letters excluded so far: A, E, S, T, N, U, M  

Remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, I, L, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word matching:  
- Positions: ? ? O ? R  
- H appears in position 2 or 4  
- No A, E, S, T, N, U, M

Candidate words:
1. H in position 2: _ H O _ R  
   – CHOIR: C, H, O, I, R – H in 2, O in 3, R in 5 – valid, but I is untested and C is okay.  
   – DHOLL: not an English word.  
   – PHOTR: not a word.

2. H in position 4: _ _ O H R  
   – DOKHR: not a word.  
   – GHOUL: has U (excluded).  
   – BOOHR: not a word.  

Only common valid word in pattern _ H O _ R is CHOIR.
