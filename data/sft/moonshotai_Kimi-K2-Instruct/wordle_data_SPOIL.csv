Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Good starting words often contain common consonants and vowels. The best starting words typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, C, etc. 

Some popular strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it has a good mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), giving us a strong basis to work from.

The feedback tells me that none of the five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore I must pick a word that contains none of those five letters and still has five distinct common letters to maximize information gain.  
Good remaining consonants include S, T, L, M, D, P, G, B, H, F, K, W, Y, V, Z, etc.  
Good remaining vowels are I, O, U.

One well-balanced set of five unused common letters is S, T, O, I, and L, giving the word “STOIL” (a valid Scrabble word/variant spelling).  
Another common choice is “SOUND” (S, O, U, N, D), but N is already eliminated.  
“STUMP” is a good alternative (S, T, U, M, P).  
I’ll go with “STUMP” because each letter is common and none of them appeared in CRANE.

Let’s interpret the new feedback:

1. S(✓) – first letter is definitely S.
2. P(✓) – second letter is definitely P.
3. I(-) – the letter I exists in the word, but not in position 3.
4. L(-) – the letter L exists in the word, but not in position 4.
5. L(✓) – the fifth letter is definitely L.

Thus we now know the exact pattern:

S P _ _ L

with the additional constraints:
- I must appear somewhere in the third or fourth position.
- L is already fixed at position 5, so the word will contain L exactly once (the feedback only confirmed one L at the end).

That leaves us needing two more distinct letters (not yet eliminated: not C, R, A, N, E, T, U, M). Remaining common consonants and vowels include: D, F, G, H, O, K, W, Y, etc.

Possible combinations that fit S P _ _ L with I in 3 or 4:

- SP I _ L → SP I D L, SP I K L, SP I G L, etc.
- SP _ I L → SP H I L, SP D I L, SP G I L, etc.

Quick dictionary check shows:

- SPIEL – valid 5-letter English word meaning a speech or story, fits S P I E L → S(✓), P(✓), I(-) would mean I is present but not in 3rd spot; here I is in 3rd, so it contradicts feedback.
- SPYEL – not a word.
- SPDIL – not a word.
- SPIKE – doesn’t end with L.
- SPIND – doesn’t end with L.

Another run: SP I _ L:
- SP I D L → “SPIDEL” – not 5 letters.
- SP I C L – C is eliminated.
- SP I K L – “SP I K L” = “SPIKL” – not a word.
- SP I N L – N eliminated.
- SP I G L – “SPIGL” – no.

SP _ I L:
- SP O I L – “SPOIL” – S(✓), P(✓), O(✓), I(-) would mean I is present not in 4th – but here I is in 4th, contradiction.

- SP E I L – E eliminated.
- SP Y I L – “SPYIL” – no.
- SP D I L – “SPDIL” – no.
- SP G I L – “SPGIL” – no.

Realizing the English word “SPOOL” is 5 letters and ends with L, but contains O twice. Let’s check constraints:
S P O O L
- S(✓) ✓
- P(✓) ✓
- O – not yet eliminated.
- O – not yet eliminated.
- L(✓) ✓
- I must appear: SPOOL does not contain I, so it violates the I(-) clue.

Another candidate: “SPIKY” – doesn’t fit.

Realizing “SPILL” already used two Ls, but feedback showed only one L confirmed at the end. Therefore, the word has exactly one L positioned at the end.

Let’s list every possible S P _ _ L with I in 3rd or 4th and letters only from allowed set:

- SP H I L – “SPHIL” – no
- SP O I L – “SPOIL” – S P O I L – I is in 4th spot, but feedback says I(-) means I is not in 3rd spot; here I is in 4th, which satisfies I(-). Also, O is still allowed. All letters used are allowed.

So “SPOIL” fits all constraints:
S P O I L
Positions: 1-5
S(✓), P(✓), O (new letter), I (must appear, is in 4th spot, satisfies I(-)), L(✓).
