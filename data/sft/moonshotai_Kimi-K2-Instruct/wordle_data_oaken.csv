For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. A good starting word should have:
1. No repeated letters (to test 5 unique letters)
2. Common consonants and vowels
3. Good coverage of frequently used letters

Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of common letters.

Interpreting the new feedback:

Guess 2: OCEAN  
O(✓) – O is in the word and already in the correct position (spot 1).  
C(x) – C is not in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in spot 3.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in spot 4.  
N(✓) – N is in the word and already in the correct position (spot 5).

Known facts so far:
1. The word begins with O and ends with N: O _ _ _ N
2. It must contain A and E (somewhere in the middle three positions), but not in spots 3 or 4 respectively.
3. Forbidden letters: R, S, C.
4. Remaining middle letters to fill: positions 2 and 3 (or 4, depending on where A and E go).

Possible placement for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 2 or 3.  
- E cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 2 or 4.  
- Since position 4 can’t be A (per above), if E takes position 4, then A must be in 2 or 3.  
- But position 3 can’t be E, so if A is in 3, E must be in 2.

Consider combinations:
- O A E _ N but position 4 would be empty (invalid).  
- O E A _ N – valid, but A would be in position 3, E in 2.  
- O _ A E N – valid, A in 3, E in 4.  
- O _ E A N – invalid, A is in 4 (forbidden).

So the only valid structures are:
1. O E A _ N (A in 3, needs a letter in 4)  
2. O _ A E N (A in 3, E in 4)  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, ends with N, contains A and E, but not R, S, C. Let’s look for common words:

Check OLEAN – but contains C. No.  
OLEAN is invalid (has C).  
Check OCEAN – already used.  
Check OMEGA – ends with A, not N.  
Check OPINE – ends with E, not N.  

Wait – we need O _ _ _ N. Let’s try:  
OLÉAN – no, not a valid English word.  
OATEN – contains A and E, starts with O, ends with N. Check letters: O, A, T, E, N.  
- O in 1 (correct)  
- A in 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in 4)  
- T in 3 (new letter)  
- E in 4 (allowed, since E can’t be in 3)  
- N in 5 (correct)  

No forbidden letters (R, S, C). “OATEN” seems valid.  
Verify: OATEN is a real word (past participle of ""eat,"" archaic but valid in Scrabble/Wordle).

Thus, “OATEN” fits all constraints.

1. O E A _ N (A in 3, needs a letter in 4)  
2. O _ A E N (A in 3, E in 4)  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, ends with N, contains A and E, but not R, S, C. Let’s look for common words:

Check OLEAN – but contains C. No.  
OLEAN is invalid (has C).  
Check OCEAN – already used.  
Check OMEGA – ends with A, not N.  
Check OPINE – ends with E, not N.  

Wait – we need O _ _ _ N. Let’s try:  
OLÉAN – no, not a valid English word.  
OATEN – contains A and E, starts with O, ends with N. Check letters: O, A, T, E, N.  
- O in 1 (correct)  
- A in 2 (allowed, since A can’t be in 4)  
- T in 3 (new letter)  
- E in 4 (allowed, since E can’t be in 3)  
- N in 5 (correct)  

No forbidden letters (R, S, C). “OATEN” seems valid.  
Verify: OATEN is a real word (past participle of ""eat,"" archaic but valid in Scrabble/Wordle).

Thus, “OATEN” fits all constraints.

We now have:

- O(✓) in position 1  
- A(✓) in position 2  
- E(✓) in position 4  
- N(✓) in position 5  

The only position still unknown is position 3.  
All feedback so far tells us the word is of the form:  
O A _ E N  

Forbidden letters (from earlier feedback): R, S, C, T.  
We need a single 5th letter that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid English word.

Letters already confirmed present: O, A, E, N  
Letters already confirmed absent (from feedback): R, S, C, T

Remaining common consonants for position 3: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Quick scan of common English 5-letter words starting with OA and ending with EN:

- OAVEN – not standard  
- OAKEN – valid word  
- OAMEN – not standard  
- OAPEN – not standard  
- OARED – ends D, not N  
- OAFEN – not a word

“OAKEN” is the clear candidate:  
O A K E N – fits positions 1-5 exactly, and K has not been excluded.
