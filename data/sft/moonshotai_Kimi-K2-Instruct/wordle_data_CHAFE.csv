For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that are frequently found in 5-letter words. 

I'm considering words like:
- ""AROSE"" - uses all common vowels and S
- ""SLATE"" - uses common letters including S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels

""SLATE"" seems like a strong choice because it includes:
- S - very common starting letter
- L - common consonant
- A - common vowel
- T - common consonant
- E - most common letter in English

This should give me good information about several common letters and their positions.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: C H _ A E  (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 confirmed)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, N, I, M
- So position 4 must be a letter that hasn’t been tried and isn’t on the “no” list.

Looking at the alphabet, unused letters that are still legal:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words fitting C H _ A E:
- CHA**E*  
  – CHAFE (F allowed)  
  – CHAGE (not a word)  
  – CHAKE (K allowed)  
  – CHAVE (rare, but V allowed)  
  – CHAPE (P allowed)

The most everyday word among these is CHAFE, so I’ll test F in position 4.
