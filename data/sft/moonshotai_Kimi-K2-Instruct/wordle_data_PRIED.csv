For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad range to test against the secret word.

Let's consider likely candidates:
- E _ R _ _ D: but E can't be in position 1 because feedback shows E(-) in position 3 (from TREAD), so E could be position 4.

- R is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 4.
- D is correct in position 5.
- F is not in the word.

So now we know the exact pattern of the word:
- Position 1: unknown (but we know it's not A, O, S, T, F)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D

So the word looks like: _ R I E D

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. Common letters that haven't been eliminated (A, O, S, T, F are out) and make sense in position 1 include B, C, G, P, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ R I E D, possible words are:
- BRIED
- CRIED
- GRIED (but ""gried"" isn't a valid word)
- PRIED

So the most likely candidates are BRIED, CRIED, PRIED.

Let's pick ""CRIED"" as it's a common word.

- F is not in the word.

So now we know the exact pattern of the word:
- Position 1: unknown (but we know it's not A, O, S, T, F)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D

So the word looks like: _ R I E D

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. Common letters that haven't been eliminated (A, O, S, T, F are out) and make sense in position 1 include B, C, G, P, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ R I E D, possible words are:
- BRIED
- CRIED
- GRIED (but ""gried"" isn't a valid word)
- PRIED

So the most likely candidates are BRIED, CRIED, PRIED.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,PRIED,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad range to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct second position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, and S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _ with an E somewhere else (positions 1,3,4 or 5).

To explore common consonants and keep the E while avoiding the eliminated letters (A,O,S), I'll try ""TREAD"":
- T and D are common consonants we haven’t tested yet.
- E is kept but moved to position 4.
- This also tests the new letters T and D.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - So the pattern is _ R _ _ _
   - E is somewhere in the word, but not at positions 1, 3, 5.
   - Eliminated letters so far: A, O, S, T.

2. TREAD → T(x) R(✓) E(-) A(x) D(✓)
   - Again confirms R is in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not at position 3.
   - D is in the word and in position 5 (because it's marked ✓ for correct position)
   - Eliminates T and A again (already known).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ D
- E must be in position 1, 4 (since it can't be in 3 or 5)
- Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, O, S, T)

Let's consider likely candidates:
- E _ R _ _ D: but E can't be in position 1 because feedback shows E(-) in position 3 (from TREAD), so E could be position 4.
- So pattern: _ R _ E D

Possible words: BREED, CREED, FREED, GREED, etc. But these have EE which might be unlikely.
Other options: FRIED, CRIED, PRIED, etc. - but I is a common vowel, and these fit the pattern _ R I E D.

Let's try ""FRIED"" as it uses common letters we haven't eliminated.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from Guess 3 (FRIED) shows:

That means:
- R is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- E is correct in position 4.
- D is correct in position 5.
- F is not in the word.

So now we know the exact pattern of the word:
- Position 1: unknown (but we know it's not A, O, S, T, F)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D

So the word looks like: _ R I E D

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. Common letters that haven't been eliminated (A, O, S, T, F are out) and make sense in position 1 include B, C, G, P, etc.

From every feedback so far the last four letters are locked in as R I E D, and the first letter is **not** A, O, S, T, F, C, B.

The only common English word left that starts with a consonant we haven’t ruled out is **PRIED**.

We have one remaining guess—let’s use it on PRIED.
