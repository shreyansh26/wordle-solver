Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This gives a good mix of common letters that appear in many English words, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

So far we know:

- Contains an E in 1, 2, or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,C,R,N)

Possible letters left (from the alphabet minus the ruled-out set):
B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already known O.

I need a word that fits:
- _ _ O _ _
- with E somewhere, and no banned letters.

Good candidates:
- E is in position 2: “B E O _ _” (words like “BEOW_” – no real word)
- E is in position 4: “_ _ O E _”
- E is in position 1: “E _ O _ _”

From the latest feedback:

- B(x) → B is not in the word.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- G(x) → G is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, B, G  
Letters that are in the word: O (but not in position 2), E (but not in position 4 or 5), Y (and must be in position 5).  

Current pattern:
- Position 5 = Y
- Position 3 must be O (because we had O(✓) in position 3 from CRONE, and the feedback O(-) in BOGEY just tells us it is not in position 2, so position 3 is still correct).
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be 4 or 5).

So the word looks like:
[1 or 2] E _ O _ Y or _ [1 or 2] E O _ Y

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out and not used in forbidden positions):
Letters left: D, E, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O, Y already fixed).

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with allowed letters, ensuring:
- E is in position 1 or 2
- Position 3 = O
- Position 5 = Y

Let’s list possible combinations:

Case 1: E in position 1 → E _ O _ Y
We need a letter for position 2 and 4 from remaining letters (D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Valid English words:
- E D O M Y → ""EDOMY"" – not a valid word
- E D O Z Y → not a word
- E P O X Y → ""EPOXY"" – valid word
- E V O K Y – not a word
- E V O R Y – R is banned
- E V O M Y – not a word
- E W O K Y – not a word
- E Z O N Y – N is banned

Only ""EPOXY"" seems valid here.

Case 2: E in position 2 → _ E O _ Y
We need a letter for position 1 and 4 from remaining letters.

Valid words:
- D E O R Y – R is banned
- F E O D Y – not a word
- H E O X Y – not a word
- J E O L Y – L is banned
- K E O M Y – not a word
- M E O W Y – not a word
- P E O N Y – N is banned
- V E O R Y – R is banned
- X E O N Y – N is banned

No valid English words found in this case.

Thus, the only valid candidate is ""EPOXY"".
