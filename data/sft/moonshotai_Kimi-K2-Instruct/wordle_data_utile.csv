For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, I, S, T, N, O. 

The word ""ARISE"" contains many of these common letters:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Let’s re-express the feedback for clarity:

Guess 1: ARISE  
A(x) R(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
→ I is in position 3, E is in position 5.  
Letters ruled out: A, R, S.

Guess 2: TILED  
T(-) I(-) L(-) E(-) D(x)  
→  
- T is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradiction with Guess 1!).  
Wait, that can’t be—Guess 1 already fixed I in position 3.  
Re-reading the feedback format: a “-” means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.  
But Guess 2 had I in position 3, and the feedback for that slot is “I(-)”.  
That would imply I is in the word but NOT in position 3, which flatly contradicts the first guess’s feedback that I(✓) is in position 3.

The only way both feedbacks can be true is if the second feedback line is being reported slot-by-slot without adjusting for the already locked positions.  
Interpreting the feedback literally per slot:

Guess 2: TILED  
Slot 1: T(-) → T is in the word, but not in slot 1.  
Slot 2: I(-) → I is in the word, but not in slot 2. (Agrees with Guess 1: I is in slot 3.)  
Slot 3: L(-) → L is in the word, but not in slot 3.  
Slot 4: E(-) → E is in the word, but not in slot 4. (Agrees with Guess 1: E is in slot 5.)  
Slot 5: D(x) → D is NOT in the word.

So to summarize what we know so far:

Pattern: _ _ I _ E  
Letters known to be present somewhere (but not in the positions marked): T (not 1), L (not 3).  
Letters ruled out: A, R, S, D.

We need a 5-letter word ending in I _ E that includes T and L in other positions, avoiding A, R, S, D.

Candidate letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but limited by what’s been tested.

We need:
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- T (must appear, but not in position 1)
- L (must appear, but not in position 3)

Possible positions for T and L: among slots 2 and 4.

So the word must look like: [not T][T or L]I[L or T]E.

Two possibilities:
1. [?][T]I[L]E → _ T I L E  
2. [?][L]I[T]E → _ L I T E

We need to check which of these are valid English words.

- TILE: 4 letters → invalid.  
- LTITE: not a word.  
- UTILE: 5 letters, but U is untested; let’s check: UTILE means “useful,” and it is a valid word.  
- BLITE: not a word.  
- CLITE: not a word.  
- FLITE: archaic variant of “flyte,” but let’s keep it in mind.  
- GLITE: not a word.  
- H?LITE: hitlite? no.  
- KLITE: not a word.  
- MLITE: not a word.  
- NLITE: not a word.  
- OLITE: not a word.  
- PLITE: not a word.  
- QLITE: not a word.  
- SLITE: contains S, ruled out.  
- TLITE: not a word.  
- VLITE: not a word.  
- WLITE: not a word.  
- XLITE: not a word.  
- YLITE: not a word.

Similarly for _ T I L E:

- ATILE: contains A, ruled out.  
- BTILE: not a word.  
- CTILE: not a word.  
- FTILE: not a word.  
- GTILE: not a word.  
- HTILE: not a word.  
- JTILE: not a word.

- TTILE: not a word.

- VTILE: not a word.  
- WTILE: not a word.  
- XTILE: not a word.  
- YTILE: not a word.  
- ZTILE: not a word.

So the only valid 5-letter English word fitting both patterns is UTILE.

Let me verify:
- UTILE: letters U, T, I, L, E.
- Pattern: U T I L E → positions: 1:U, 2:T, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E.
- Constraints:
  - I is in position 3: ✓ matches Guess 1.
  - E is in position 5: ✓ matches Guess 1.
  - T is in the word but not in position 1: in UTILE, T is in position 2 → satisfies T(-) from Guess 2.
  - L is in the word but not in position 3: in UTILE, L is in position 4 → satisfies L(-) from Guess 2.
  - No A, R, S, D: ✓.

Therefore, UTILE is a valid next guess.
