Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters and their positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Looking at common 5-letter word patterns, words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses because they contain frequently occurring letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it has:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good mix of letters that can help reveal the word structure quickly

This should give me good information about which letters are present and in what positions.

The feedback from AROSE is all x's, meaning none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all. This eliminates 5 very common letters.  
My next move should be to choose a 5-letter word composed entirely of letters *not* in {A, R, O, S, E}.  
Good candidates use common remaining consonants and vowels: I, U, T, N, L, D, C, etc.  
A popular second-guess word that avoids AROSE and still covers frequent letters is ""UNTIL"": it contains U (vowel), N, T, I, L. None of these appear in the first guess, so they are all still possible.

   - I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - U, T, L are NOT in the word at all.

Remaining common letters we have not tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, plus the confirmed letters N and I (whose exact positions are still unknown).

A good next guess would use as many new, high-frequency letters as possible while respecting the known constraints. Let’s pick a word that contains N and I, avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, and places N and I in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

One strong candidate is “CHINK”:
- C and H are new letters.
- K is new.
- N is placed in a new possible position (4).
- I is placed in a new possible position (2).
- It satisfies every known constraint.

Other options like “MINKY” or “PINKY” would also work, but “CHINK” tests more unique consonants.

  – C is the first letter (✓ in position 1).
  – H is in the word but not in position 2.
  – I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
  – N is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Contains both H and I somewhere
3. Contains N somewhere
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out so far

Remaining letters to work with include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Current pattern: C _ _ _ _

Possible placements:
- I can be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3 or 4)
- N can be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2, 4, 5)
- H can be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s test a word that fits these constraints: ""CHIN?"" would be ideal, but we need a 5-letter word. One valid option is ""CHIN?"" or ""CHING"", but G hasn't been tested yet, so ""CHING"" could work. Let me check if it violates any rules:
- C ✓ (position 1)
- H is allowed (not in position 2)
- I is allowed (position 3) – but wait, I can't be in position 3. So ""CHING"" is invalid.

Next option: ""CHIMP"" – but P hasn't been tested, and M hasn't been tested. Let's see:
- C ✓
- H is allowed (position 2) – but H can't be in position 2. So invalid.

Next: ""CINCH"" – but C is already in position 1, and we can't have duplicates unless C is allowed twice (which isn't indicated). Also H is in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), N in position 4 (but N can't be in 4). So invalid.

Next: ""CYNIC"" – but C is already in position 1, and we have no info on Y or second C. Also I would be in position 4 (invalid). Not ideal.

Next: ""CHINK"" was already guessed. 

Let me try ""CRIMP"" – but R is ruled out. 

""CHIVE"" – E is ruled out.

""CHIDE"" – E is ruled out.

""CHINO"" – O is ruled out.

""CHIMP"" – H is position 2 (invalid).

""CHINK"" – already used.

""CHIPS"" – S is ruled out.

""CHIVE"" – E ruled out.

""CHILI"" – L ruled out, I in position 4 (invalid).

""CHINK"" – already used.

""CHUCK"" – U and K ruled out.

""CHAFF"" – A and F (F not tested yet), but A is ruled out.

""CHILD"" – L ruled out.

""CHIME"" – E ruled out.

""CHIMP"" – H in position 2 (invalid).

""CHINA"" – A ruled out.

""CHING"" – I in position 3 (invalid).

""CHINO"" – O ruled out.

""CHINS"" – S ruled out.

""CHIPS"" – S ruled out.

""CHIRP"" – R ruled out.

""CHIVE"" – E ruled out.

""CHOMP"" – O ruled out.

""CHUNK"" – U and K ruled out.

""CHURN"" – U and R ruled out.

I think the only valid remaining guess that satisfies all constraints is ""CHIMP"" – but H is in position 2, which was marked as wrong. So this must be invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints more carefully:

- Word must start with C
- Must contain H, I, N (each appearing exactly once)
- H cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- No letters from the excluded list

Possible positions:
C _ _ _ _

H can be in 3,4,5
I can be in 2,5
N can be in 3 (since 5 is excluded for N, and 2,4 are excluded)

But if N must be in 3, then:
C _ N _ _

Now place H and I:
H can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is N)
I can be in 2 or 5 (can't be in 3,4)

Let's try:
- C I N H _ – but then where does the 5th letter go? This is 4 letters.
We need 5 letters, so the remaining letter must be from allowed letters (D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y)

So possible forms:
C I N H ? – but that's 4 letters.
C I N ? H – 4 letters.

Wait, I think I'm miscounting. Let me list possible 5-letter words that start with C and contain H, I, N with the constraints:

Looking for:
C _ _ _ _
positions: 1 2 3 4 5

Constraints:
- H in {3,4,5}
- I in {2,5}
- N in {3} (only possible position left for N)

So N must be in position 3:
C _ N _ _

Now place H and I:
H can be in 4 or 5
I can be in 2 or 5

Option 1:
C I N H ? – but we need 5 letters, so:
C I N H ? – needs a 5th letter, but we've used C, I, N, H. The 5th must be from allowed letters.

Possible word: ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated (position 1 and 5), and we have no info on repeated letters. Also, C is already in position 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. This seems risky.

Option 2:
C _ N _ H
I must be in 2 or 5. 5 is H, so I must be in 2:
C I N _ H

Now the 4th letter must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- C I N D H – not a valid word
- C I N G H – not valid
- C I N F H – not valid
- C I N M H – not valid
- C I N P H – not valid
- C I N B H – not valid
- C I N V H – not valid
- C I N W H – not valid
- C I N Y H – not valid

Hmm, no valid English words here. Maybe N can be in position 5? But N can't be in 5 (from feedback: N(-) in CHINK). So N must be in 3.

Alternative approach: maybe I is in 5 and N in 3:
C _ N _ I

Now place H in 4:
C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)

Possible word: ""CUNHI"" – not valid
""CFNHI"" – not valid
""CGNHI"" – not valid
""CMNHI"" – not valid
""CPNHI"" – not valid
""CVNHI"" – not valid
""CWNHI"" – not valid
""CYNHI"" – not valid

No valid words here either.

This suggests I might have made an error in assuming N must be in 3. Let me re-examine the N constraint:

From UNTIL: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 2
From CHINK: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 4
So N cannot be in positions 2 or 4
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5
But position 1 is already C, so N must be in 3 or 5

If N is in 5:
C _ _ _ N

Now place I and H:
I cannot be in 3 or 4, so I must be in 2:
C I _ _ N

Now place H:
H cannot be in 2 (already I), cannot be in 2 (from CHINK H(-) means not in position 2, but that's already satisfied), can be in 3 or 4:
C I H _ N or C I _ H N

Now fill the remaining spot with allowed letters (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)

Possible words:
- C I H D N – not valid
- C I H G N – ""CHIGN"" – not valid
- C I H M N – ""CHIMN"" – not valid
- C I H P N – ""CHPIN"" – not valid
- C I H B N – ""CHBIN"" – not valid
- C I H V N – ""CHVIN"" – not valid
- C I H W N – ""CHWIN"" – not valid
- C I H Y N – ""CHYIN"" – not valid

Similarly, C I _ H N:
C I B H N – ""CIBHN"" – not valid
C I D H N – ""CIDHN"" – not valid
C I F H N – ""CIFHN"" – not valid
C I G H N – ""CIGHN"" – not valid
C I M H N – ""CIMHN"" – not valid
C I P H N – ""CIPHN"" – not valid
C I V H N – ""CIVHN"" – not valid
C I W H N – ""CIWHN"" – not valid
C I Y H N – ""CIYHN"" – not valid

This indicates no valid English words fit these constraints. I must have missed a possibility.

Re-examizing constraints:
- C is in 1
- Must contain H and I
- N is in word, positions 2,4 excluded
- I cannot be in 3,4
- H cannot be in 2

Alternative placement:
C _ _ _ _
Let me try N in 3 again, but with different arrangement:

C _ N _ _
I must be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 2,3)

Case 1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but we've used C,I,N,H. No valid word.
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter:
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" is actually a valid word (a type of payment), though uncommon.

Case 2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – ""CBNHI"" – not valid
  C D N H I – ""CDNH I"" – not valid
  C F N H I – ""CFNHI"" – not valid
  C G N H I – ""CGNHI"" – not valid
  C M N H I – ""CMNHI"" – not valid
  C P N H I – ""CPNHI"" – not valid
  C V N H I – ""CVNHI"" – not valid
  C W N H I – ""CWNHI"" – not valid
  C Y N H I – ""CYNHI"" – not valid

The only possible valid word appears to be ""CHING"", despite its uncommon usage. Let's check:
- C in 1 ✓
- H in 3 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 – but H is in 3, so N must be elsewhere. This is invalid.

I realize now that in ""CHING"":
Letters: C,H,I,N,G
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
But:
- C in 1 ✓
- H would be in 2 – but H cannot be in 2 (from CHINK feedback)
- I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3
- N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4
So this is invalid.

This leaves me with no obvious valid English words. However, upon closer inspection, one valid word that fits all constraints is ""CYNIC"":
- C in 1 ✓
- Y (new letter)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4 (invalid)
So invalid.

Another possibility: ""CHIN?"" – but no valid 5-letter word.

Upon reflection, the only plausible word that starts with C, contains H, I, N with the given constraints is ""CHIMP"", but H would be in 2 (invalid). 

This suggests the word must be ""CHIN?"" but no such word exists. I must have missed a simpler path.

Reconstructing:
C _ _ _ _
Known letters: C, H, I, N
Excluded positions:
- H: not 2
- I: not 3,4
- N: not 2,4,5
Thus:
N must be in 3 (only option left)
C _ N _ _
I can be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5

If I is in 2:
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but we've used C,I,N,H. No valid word.
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – but this is actually ""CHING"" spelled as C-H-I-N-G, which starts with C, H in 2 (invalid), so no.

If I is in 5:
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – ""CBNHI"" – not valid
  C D N H I – ""CDNHI"" – not valid
  C F N H I – ""CFNHI"" – not valid
  C G N H I – ""CGNHI"" – not valid
  C M N H I – ""CMNHI"" – not valid
  C P N H I – ""CPNHI"" – not valid
  C V N H I – ""CVNHI"" – not valid
  C W N H I – ""CWNHI"" – not valid
  C Y N H I – ""CYNHI"" – not valid

This seems impossible. However, I realize I missed the word ""CINCH"":
- C in 1 ✓
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- C in 4 – but C is already in 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, H is missing.
This doesn't work.

Upon deeper reflection, the constraints appear to eliminate all possible English words. This suggests an error in earlier steps. Re-examining the feedback:

From CHINK:
- C ✓ in 1
- H is in word but not 2 (-)
- I is in word but not 3 (-)
- N is in word but not 4 (-)
- K x

Thus:
C _ _ _ _
H: in 3,4,5
I: in 2,5
N: in 2,3,5 (cannot be 4)
But N cannot be in 2 (from UNTIL: N(-) means not in 2)
Thus N must be in 3 or 5

Case 1: N in 3
C _ N _ _
I must be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5

Subcase 1.1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but no valid word forms
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N F H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – invalid as noted
  C I N M H – not valid
  C I N P H – not valid
  C I N V H – not valid
  C I N W H – not valid
  C I N Y H – not valid

Subcase 1.2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – not valid
  C D N H I – not valid
  C F N H I – not valid
  C G N H I – not valid
  C M N H I – not valid
  C P N H I – not valid
  C V N H I – not valid
  C W N H I – not valid
  C Y N H I – not valid

Case 2: N in 5
C _ _ _ N
I must be in 2 (since 5 is N)
C I _ _ N
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C I H _ N – needs 4th letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I H D N – not valid
  C I H F N – not valid
  C I H G N – not valid
  C I H M N – not valid
  C I H P N – not valid
  C I H V N – not valid
  C I H W N – not valid
  C I H Y N – not valid
- C I _ H N – needs 3rd letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I D H N – not valid
  C I F H N – not valid
  C I G H N – not valid
  C I M H N – not valid
  C I P H N – not valid
  C I V H N – not valid
  C I W H N – not valid
  C I Y H N – not valid

This exhaustive search reveals no valid English 5-letter words that satisfy all constraints. This implies either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The secret word is non-standard or misspelled
3. A misstep in letter placement

However, upon recalling common 5-letter words, ""CHIMP"" comes to mind, but H is in 2 (invalid). Another is ""CHICK"" – but K is excluded.

The only possible valid word that fits is ""CHILD"" – but L is excluded.

This is perplexing. Rechecking allowed letters: the excluded letters are A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L,K. Remaining letters include B,C,D,F,G,H,I,M,N,P,V,W,Y.

Given the constraints, the word must be of form:
C _ _ _ _, containing H,I,N with specific exclusions.

The only plausible word is ""CHIMP"", but H would be in 2 (invalid). 

After careful reconsideration, the word must be ""CHIMP"" despite the H position issue, indicating possible misinterpretation. However, the constraints are clear.

Upon deeper lexical search, the correct valid word fitting all constraints is ""CHINO"" – but O is excluded. 

This suggests the word is ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated and H is missing from needed positions.

Realizing the oversight: the word ""CHINK"" feedback showed C(✓) H(-) I(-) N(-) K(x), meaning:
- C is 1
- H is in word but not 2
- I is in word but not 3
- N is in word but not 4
- K not present

Thus the correct form is C _ _ _ _, with H,I,N placed appropriately. The only valid English word satisfying these is:

""CHIMP"" – but H is in 2 (invalid per CHINK feedback).

This appears impossible, indicating an error. Rechecking CHINK positions:
C(1) H(2) I(3) N(4) K(5)
Feedback: C(✓) H(-) I(-) N(-) K(x)
Thus:
- C in 1 ✓
- H is in word but NOT in 2
- I is in word but NOT in 3
- N is in word but NOT in 4
- K not in word

Now reconstructing:
C _ _ _ _
Letters to place: H,I,N
Possible positions:
H: 3,4,5
I: 2,5
N: 2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

Case 1: N in 2
C N _ _ _
Now place H and I:
H: 3,4,5
I: 5 (only, since 2,3,4 are taken or excluded)
Thus:
C N _ _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C N H _ I – needs 4th letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C N H B I – not valid
  C N H D I – not valid
  C N H F I – not valid
  C N H G I – ""CNHGI"" – not valid
  C N H M I – ""CNHMI"" – not valid
  C N H P I – ""CNHPI"" – not valid
  C N H V I – ""CNHVI"" – not valid
  C N H W I – ""CNHWI"" – not valid
  C N H Y I – ""CNHYI"" – not valid
- C N _ H I – needs 3rd letter from allowed
  C N B H I – not valid
  C N D H I – not valid
  C N F H I – not valid
  C N G H I – ""CNGHI"" – not valid
  C N M H I – not valid
  C N P H I – not valid
  C N V H I – not valid
  C N W H I – not valid
  C N Y H I – not valid

Case 2: N in 3
C _ N _ _
Now place H and I:
H: 4,5
I: 2,5
Subcase 2.1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but no valid word
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter:
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N F H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – invalid as H is 4, but ""CHING"" is C-H-I-N-G
  The word would need to be C-I-N-G-H (""CINGH"") – not valid
Subcase 2.2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 4:
C _ N H I
Needs 2nd letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
Valid word: ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated (position 1 and 5), and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. This seems the closest match, despite the C repeat.

Case 3: N in 5
C _ _ _ N
I must be in 2 (since 5 is N)
C I _ _ N
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C I H _ N – needs 4th letter:
  C I H D N – ""CIHDN"" – not valid
  C I H F N – ""CIHFN"" – not valid
  C I H G N – ""CIHGN"" – not valid
  C I H M N – ""CIHMN"" – not valid
  C I H P N – ""CIHPN"" – not valid
  C I H V N – ""CIHVN"" – not valid
  C I H W N – ""CIHWN"" – not valid
  C I H Y N – ""CIHYN"" – not valid
- C I _ H N – needs 3rd letter:
  C I D H N – ""CIDHN"" – not valid
  C I F H N – not valid
  C I G H N – not valid
  C I M H N – not valid
  C I P H N – not valid
  C I V H N – not valid
  C I W H N – not valid
  C I Y H N – not valid

After exhaustive checking, the only possible valid word that fits is ""CINCH"" despite the C repetition, as it's the closest match in the dictionary.

However, ""CINCH"" has C in positions 1 and 4, which may not be invalid unless duplicates are prohibited (which isn't stated). Given the constraints, this seems acceptable.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""CINCH"".

</think>

After carefully analyzing all constraints:
- C is confirmed in position 1.
- N must be in position 3 (only remaining valid spot based on feedback).
- I must be in position 2 or 5.
- H must fit in the remaining slots.

The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""CINCH"", even though it repeats the letter C.

<guess>CINCH</guess>",CINCH,"From the three guesses we now know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, K
- Positions and letters:
  – C is the first letter (✓ in position 1).
  – H is in the word but not in position 2.
  – I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
  – N is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Contains both H and I somewhere
3. Contains N somewhere
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out so far

Remaining letters to work with include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Current pattern: C _ _ _ _

Possible placements:
- I can be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3 or 4)
- N can be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2, 4, 5)
- H can be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 2)

Let’s test a word that fits these constraints: ""CHIN?"" would be ideal, but we need a 5-letter word. One valid option is ""CHIN?"" or ""CHING"", but G hasn't been tested yet, so ""CHING"" could work. Let me check if it violates any rules:
- C ✓ (position 1)
- H is allowed (not in position 2)
- I is allowed (position 3) – but wait, I can't be in position 3. So ""CHING"" is invalid.

Next option: ""CHIMP"" – but P hasn't been tested, and M hasn't been tested. Let's see:
- C ✓
- H is allowed (position 2) – but H can't be in position 2. So invalid.

Next: ""CINCH"" – but C is already in position 1, and we can't have duplicates unless C is allowed twice (which isn't indicated). Also H is in position 3 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), N in position 4 (but N can't be in 4). So invalid.

Next: ""CYNIC"" – but C is already in position 1, and we have no info on Y or second C. Also I would be in position 4 (invalid). Not ideal.

Next: ""CHINK"" was already guessed. 

Let me try ""CRIMP"" – but R is ruled out. 

""CHIVE"" – E is ruled out.

""CHIDE"" – E is ruled out.

""CHINO"" – O is ruled out.

""CHIMP"" – H is position 2 (invalid).

""CHINK"" – already used.

""CHIPS"" – S is ruled out.

""CHIVE"" – E ruled out.

""CHILI"" – L ruled out, I in position 4 (invalid).

""CHINK"" – already used.

""CHUCK"" – U and K ruled out.

""CHAFF"" – A and F (F not tested yet), but A is ruled out.

""CHILD"" – L ruled out.

""CHIME"" – E ruled out.

""CHIMP"" – H in position 2 (invalid).

""CHINA"" – A ruled out.

""CHING"" – I in position 3 (invalid).

""CHINO"" – O ruled out.

""CHINS"" – S ruled out.

""CHIPS"" – S ruled out.

""CHIRP"" – R ruled out.

""CHIVE"" – E ruled out.

""CHOMP"" – O ruled out.

""CHUNK"" – U and K ruled out.

""CHURN"" – U and R ruled out.

I think the only valid remaining guess that satisfies all constraints is ""CHIMP"" – but H is in position 2, which was marked as wrong. So this must be invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints more carefully:

- Word must start with C
- Must contain H, I, N (each appearing exactly once)
- H cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- No letters from the excluded list

Possible positions:
C _ _ _ _

H can be in 3,4,5
I can be in 2,5
N can be in 3 (since 5 is excluded for N, and 2,4 are excluded)

But if N must be in 3, then:
C _ N _ _

Now place H and I:
H can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is N)
I can be in 2 or 5 (can't be in 3,4)

Let's try:
- C I N H _ – but then where does the 5th letter go? This is 4 letters.
We need 5 letters, so the remaining letter must be from allowed letters (D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y)

So possible forms:
C I N H ? – but that's 4 letters.
C I N ? H – 4 letters.

Wait, I think I'm miscounting. Let me list possible 5-letter words that start with C and contain H, I, N with the constraints:

Looking for:
C _ _ _ _
positions: 1 2 3 4 5

Constraints:
- H in {3,4,5}
- I in {2,5}
- N in {3} (only possible position left for N)

So N must be in position 3:
C _ N _ _

Now place H and I:
H can be in 4 or 5
I can be in 2 or 5

Option 1:
C I N H ? – but we need 5 letters, so:
C I N H ? – needs a 5th letter, but we've used C, I, N, H. The 5th must be from allowed letters.

Possible word: ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated (position 1 and 5), and we have no info on repeated letters. Also, C is already in position 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. This seems risky.

Option 2:
C _ N _ H
I must be in 2 or 5. 5 is H, so I must be in 2:
C I N _ H

Now the 4th letter must be from allowed letters: B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- C I N D H – not a valid word
- C I N G H – not valid
- C I N F H – not valid
- C I N M H – not valid
- C I N P H – not valid
- C I N B H – not valid
- C I N V H – not valid
- C I N W H – not valid
- C I N Y H – not valid

Hmm, no valid English words here. Maybe N can be in position 5? But N can't be in 5 (from feedback: N(-) in CHINK). So N must be in 3.

Alternative approach: maybe I is in 5 and N in 3:
C _ N _ I

Now place H in 4:
C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)

Possible word: ""CUNHI"" – not valid
""CFNHI"" – not valid
""CGNHI"" – not valid
""CMNHI"" – not valid
""CPNHI"" – not valid
""CVNHI"" – not valid
""CWNHI"" – not valid
""CYNHI"" – not valid

No valid words here either.

This suggests I might have made an error in assuming N must be in 3. Let me re-examine the N constraint:

From UNTIL: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 2
From CHINK: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 4
So N cannot be in positions 2 or 4
Possible positions for N: 1,3,5
But position 1 is already C, so N must be in 3 or 5

If N is in 5:
C _ _ _ N

Now place I and H:
I cannot be in 3 or 4, so I must be in 2:
C I _ _ N

Now place H:
H cannot be in 2 (already I), cannot be in 2 (from CHINK H(-) means not in position 2, but that's already satisfied), can be in 3 or 4:
C I H _ N or C I _ H N

Now fill the remaining spot with allowed letters (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)

Possible words:
- C I H D N – not valid
- C I H G N – ""CHIGN"" – not valid
- C I H M N – ""CHIMN"" – not valid
- C I H P N – ""CHPIN"" – not valid
- C I H B N – ""CHBIN"" – not valid
- C I H V N – ""CHVIN"" – not valid
- C I H W N – ""CHWIN"" – not valid
- C I H Y N – ""CHYIN"" – not valid

Similarly, C I _ H N:
C I B H N – ""CIBHN"" – not valid
C I D H N – ""CIDHN"" – not valid
C I F H N – ""CIFHN"" – not valid
C I G H N – ""CIGHN"" – not valid
C I M H N – ""CIMHN"" – not valid
C I P H N – ""CIPHN"" – not valid
C I V H N – ""CIVHN"" – not valid
C I W H N – ""CIWHN"" – not valid
C I Y H N – ""CIYHN"" – not valid

This indicates no valid English words fit these constraints. I must have missed a possibility.

Re-examizing constraints:
- C is in 1
- Must contain H and I
- N is in word, positions 2,4 excluded
- I cannot be in 3,4
- H cannot be in 2

Alternative placement:
C _ _ _ _
Let me try N in 3 again, but with different arrangement:

C _ N _ _
I must be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 2,3)

Case 1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but we've used C,I,N,H. No valid word.
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter:
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" is actually a valid word (a type of payment), though uncommon.

Case 2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – ""CBNHI"" – not valid
  C D N H I – ""CDNH I"" – not valid
  C F N H I – ""CFNHI"" – not valid
  C G N H I – ""CGNHI"" – not valid
  C M N H I – ""CMNHI"" – not valid
  C P N H I – ""CPNHI"" – not valid
  C V N H I – ""CVNHI"" – not valid
  C W N H I – ""CWNHI"" – not valid
  C Y N H I – ""CYNHI"" – not valid

The only possible valid word appears to be ""CHING"", despite its uncommon usage. Let's check:
- C in 1 ✓
- H in 3 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 – but H is in 3, so N must be elsewhere. This is invalid.

I realize now that in ""CHING"":
Letters: C,H,I,N,G
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
But:
- C in 1 ✓
- H would be in 2 – but H cannot be in 2 (from CHINK feedback)
- I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3
- N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4
So this is invalid.

This leaves me with no obvious valid English words. However, upon closer inspection, one valid word that fits all constraints is ""CYNIC"":
- C in 1 ✓
- Y (new letter)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4 (invalid)
So invalid.

Another possibility: ""CHIN?"" – but no valid 5-letter word.

Upon reflection, the only plausible word that starts with C, contains H, I, N with the given constraints is ""CHIMP"", but H would be in 2 (invalid). 

This suggests the word must be ""CHIN?"" but no such word exists. I must have missed a simpler path.

Reconstructing:
C _ _ _ _
Known letters: C, H, I, N
Excluded positions:
- H: not 2
- I: not 3,4
- N: not 2,4,5
Thus:
N must be in 3 (only option left)
C _ N _ _
I can be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5

If I is in 2:
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but we've used C,I,N,H. No valid word.
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – but this is actually ""CHING"" spelled as C-H-I-N-G, which starts with C, H in 2 (invalid), so no.

If I is in 5:
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – ""CBNHI"" – not valid
  C D N H I – ""CDNHI"" – not valid
  C F N H I – ""CFNHI"" – not valid
  C G N H I – ""CGNHI"" – not valid
  C M N H I – ""CMNHI"" – not valid
  C P N H I – ""CPNHI"" – not valid
  C V N H I – ""CVNHI"" – not valid
  C W N H I – ""CWNHI"" – not valid
  C Y N H I – ""CYNHI"" – not valid

This seems impossible. However, I realize I missed the word ""CINCH"":
- C in 1 ✓
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- C in 4 – but C is already in 1, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, H is missing.
This doesn't work.

Upon deeper reflection, the constraints appear to eliminate all possible English words. This suggests an error in earlier steps. Re-examining the feedback:

From CHINK:
- C ✓ in 1
- H is in word but not 2 (-)
- I is in word but not 3 (-)
- N is in word but not 4 (-)
- K x

Thus:
C _ _ _ _
H: in 3,4,5
I: in 2,5
N: in 2,3,5 (cannot be 4)
But N cannot be in 2 (from UNTIL: N(-) means not in 2)
Thus N must be in 3 or 5

Case 1: N in 3
C _ N _ _
I must be in 2 or 5
H must be in 4 or 5

Subcase 1.1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but no valid word forms
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N F H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – invalid as noted
  C I N M H – not valid
  C I N P H – not valid
  C I N V H – not valid
  C I N W H – not valid
  C I N Y H – not valid

Subcase 1.2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C _ N H I – needs 2nd letter:
  C B N H I – not valid
  C D N H I – not valid
  C F N H I – not valid
  C G N H I – not valid
  C M N H I – not valid
  C P N H I – not valid
  C V N H I – not valid
  C W N H I – not valid
  C Y N H I – not valid

Case 2: N in 5
C _ _ _ N
I must be in 2 (since 5 is N)
C I _ _ N
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C I H _ N – needs 4th letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I H D N – not valid
  C I H F N – not valid
  C I H G N – not valid
  C I H M N – not valid
  C I H P N – not valid
  C I H V N – not valid
  C I H W N – not valid
  C I H Y N – not valid
- C I _ H N – needs 3rd letter from allowed (D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C I D H N – not valid
  C I F H N – not valid
  C I G H N – not valid
  C I M H N – not valid
  C I P H N – not valid
  C I V H N – not valid
  C I W H N – not valid
  C I Y H N – not valid

This exhaustive search reveals no valid English 5-letter words that satisfy all constraints. This implies either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The secret word is non-standard or misspelled
3. A misstep in letter placement

However, upon recalling common 5-letter words, ""CHIMP"" comes to mind, but H is in 2 (invalid). Another is ""CHICK"" – but K is excluded.

The only possible valid word that fits is ""CHILD"" – but L is excluded.

This is perplexing. Rechecking allowed letters: the excluded letters are A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L,K. Remaining letters include B,C,D,F,G,H,I,M,N,P,V,W,Y.

Given the constraints, the word must be of form:
C _ _ _ _, containing H,I,N with specific exclusions.

The only plausible word is ""CHIMP"", but H would be in 2 (invalid). 

After careful reconsideration, the word must be ""CHIMP"" despite the H position issue, indicating possible misinterpretation. However, the constraints are clear.

Upon deeper lexical search, the correct valid word fitting all constraints is ""CHINO"" – but O is excluded. 

This suggests the word is ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated and H is missing from needed positions.

Realizing the oversight: the word ""CHINK"" feedback showed C(✓) H(-) I(-) N(-) K(x), meaning:
- C is 1
- H is in word but not 2
- I is in word but not 3
- N is in word but not 4
- K not present

Thus the correct form is C _ _ _ _, with H,I,N placed appropriately. The only valid English word satisfying these is:

""CHIMP"" – but H is in 2 (invalid per CHINK feedback).

This appears impossible, indicating an error. Rechecking CHINK positions:
C(1) H(2) I(3) N(4) K(5)
Feedback: C(✓) H(-) I(-) N(-) K(x)
Thus:
- C in 1 ✓
- H is in word but NOT in 2
- I is in word but NOT in 3
- N is in word but NOT in 4
- K not in word

Now reconstructing:
C _ _ _ _
Letters to place: H,I,N
Possible positions:
H: 3,4,5
I: 2,5
N: 2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

Case 1: N in 2
C N _ _ _
Now place H and I:
H: 3,4,5
I: 5 (only, since 2,3,4 are taken or excluded)
Thus:
C N _ _ I
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C N H _ I – needs 4th letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
  C N H B I – not valid
  C N H D I – not valid
  C N H F I – not valid
  C N H G I – ""CNHGI"" – not valid
  C N H M I – ""CNHMI"" – not valid
  C N H P I – ""CNHPI"" – not valid
  C N H V I – ""CNHVI"" – not valid
  C N H W I – ""CNHWI"" – not valid
  C N H Y I – ""CNHYI"" – not valid
- C N _ H I – needs 3rd letter from allowed
  C N B H I – not valid
  C N D H I – not valid
  C N F H I – not valid
  C N G H I – ""CNGHI"" – not valid
  C N M H I – not valid
  C N P H I – not valid
  C N V H I – not valid
  C N W H I – not valid
  C N Y H I – not valid

Case 2: N in 3
C _ N _ _
Now place H and I:
H: 4,5
I: 2,5
Subcase 2.1: I in 2
C I N _ _
H must be in 4 or 5:
- C I N H ? – needs 5th letter, but no valid word
- C I N _ H – needs 4th letter:
  C I N D H – not valid
  C I N F H – not valid
  C I N G H – ""CHING"" – invalid as H is 4, but ""CHING"" is C-H-I-N-G
  The word would need to be C-I-N-G-H (""CINGH"") – not valid
Subcase 2.2: I in 5
C _ N _ I
H must be in 4:
C _ N H I
Needs 2nd letter from allowed (B,D,F,G,M,P,V,W,Y)
Valid word: ""CINCH"" – but C is repeated (position 1 and 5), and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. This seems the closest match, despite the C repeat.

Case 3: N in 5
C _ _ _ N
I must be in 2 (since 5 is N)
C I _ _ N
H must be in 3 or 4:
- C I H _ N – needs 4th letter:
  C I H D N – ""CIHDN"" – not valid
  C I H F N – ""CIHFN"" – not valid
  C I H G N – ""CIHGN"" – not valid
  C I H M N – ""CIHMN"" – not valid
  C I H P N – ""CIHPN"" – not valid
  C I H V N – ""CIHVN"" – not valid
  C I H W N – ""CIHWN"" – not valid
  C I H Y N – ""CIHYN"" – not valid
- C I _ H N – needs 3rd letter:
  C I D H N – ""CIDHN"" – not valid
  C I F H N – not valid
  C I G H N – not valid
  C I M H N – not valid
  C I P H N – not valid
  C I V H N – not valid
  C I W H N – not valid
  C I Y H N – not valid

After exhaustive checking, the only possible valid word that fits is ""CINCH"" despite the C repetition, as it's the closest match in the dictionary.

However, ""CINCH"" has C in positions 1 and 4, which may not be invalid unless duplicates are prohibited (which isn't stated). Given the constraints, this seems acceptable.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""CINCH"".After carefully analyzing all constraints:
- C is confirmed in position 1.
- N must be in position 3 (only remaining valid spot based on feedback).
- I must be in position 2 or 5.
- H must fit in the remaining slots.

The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""CINCH"", even though it repeats the letter C.",Guess 4: CINCH -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) I(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
