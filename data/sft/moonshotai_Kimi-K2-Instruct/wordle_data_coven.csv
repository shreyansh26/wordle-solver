For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Uses common letters (vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English)
2. Doesn't repeat any letters (to test more unique letters)
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C. A good starting word would incorporate several of these.

Possible good first guesses include: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, CRONE, or RAISE. Among these, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- All letters are distinct
- It's a common, valid English word

This should give me good information about both vowels and consonants in the secret word.

Let’s interpret the feedback for arose.

Arose  →  A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)

- A, R, S are not in the word at all (x).  
- O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S.  
- Has five letters, two of which we know must be O and E.

Next, I want to test new letters while placing O and E in different positions. Good consonants to test (since R and S are out) include T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc. I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps O and E, but shifts their positions.  
- Adds new, high-frequency consonants.  
- Avoids A, R, S.

Candidate words:  
- “molten” – invalid (6 letters)  
- “lemon” – has O in position 4, E in position 2 (both allowed), and adds L, M, N.  
- “opine” – repeats E, but keeps O at 2, E at 5 (invalid for E).  
- “clone” – C, L, O, N, E; O is at 3 (invalid)  

“lemon” seems best:
- L, M, N are untested.  
- E is in position 2 (acceptable).  
- O is in position 4 (acceptable).

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, L, M.

3. O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
4. E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.
5. N is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So the final letter pattern is:
_ _ _ _ N

Letters we still need to place / test: E, O, plus three more distinct letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Valid positions for:
- O: 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is already N), so 1 or 2.
- E: 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

We also know we need three additional letters that haven’t appeared yet (not A, R, S, L, M). Common unused consonants: T, D, C, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Candidate words satisfying:
- ends with N
- contains both E and O
- positions for E and O respect earlier constraints
- uses only allowed letters

One clean candidate is “TOKEN”:
T, K are new letters; E in 3, O in 2; ends with N.

Check positions:
- O is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 3 (allowed).

- T and K are new.

Other quick checks:

lemon → L(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(✓)

Known facts
1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, L, M.
2. The word DOES contain E, O, N.
3. O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
4. E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.
5. N is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So the final letter pattern is:
_ _ _ _ N

Letters we still need to place / test: E, O, plus three more distinct letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Valid positions for:
- O: 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is already N), so 1 or 2.
- E: 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

We also know we need three additional letters that haven’t appeared yet (not A, R, S, L, M). Common unused consonants: T, D, C, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Candidate words satisfying:
- ends with N
- contains both E and O
- positions for E and O respect earlier constraints
- uses only allowed letters

One clean candidate is “TOKEN”:
T, K are new letters; E in 3, O in 2; ends with N.

Check positions:
- O is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 3 (allowed).  
- N is in 5 (matches ✓).  
- T and K are new.

Other quick checks:
- “DOPEN”: O in 2, E in 4 – allowed.  
- “BOGEN”: O in 2, E in 4 – allowed.  

But “token” uses very common letters T and K, giving more information.

Go with token.

From the three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
2. lemon → L(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(✓)
3. token → T(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(✓)

What we now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, L, M, T, K
- Letters definitely IN the word and their exact positions:
  – Position 2: O (✓)
  – Position 4: E (✓)
  – Position 5: N (✓)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ E N

Only positions 1 and 3 remain to be filled with letters that:
  – have not been tried yet (cannot be A, R, S, L, M, T, K)
  – are distinct

Still-available letters (common ones in alphabetical order):
  B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters for slots 1 and 3 that form a valid English 5-letter word.  Possible candidates:

- B, C → “BOCEN” – not valid
- B, I → “BOIEN” – not valid
- C, I → “COIEN” – not valid
- D, I → “DOIEN” – not valid
- F, I → “FOIEN” – not valid
- G, I → “GOIEN” – not valid
- H, I → “HOIEN” – not valid
- W, I → “WOIEN” – not valid
- C, O – but O already used
- B, O – already used
- P, O – already used
- V, I → “VOIEN” – not valid
- J, O – already used
- G, O – already used
- D, O – already used

Next look at consonant-vowel or consonant-consonant combinations that create real words ending in “O_E_N”.

Real words that fit:

- “woven”  (but T is already out and W hasn’t been ruled out) – but W not yet ruled out, so a candidate
- “vixen” – but X is still available, pattern _ O _ E N – no, vixen is V I X E N which doesn’t fit positions.
- “coven” – C O V E N – fits _ O _ E N because positions 2,4,5 are fixed, so C O _ E N – but we need position 3.
- “coden” – not valid
- “doven” – not valid
- “goven” – not valid
- “hoven” – not valid
- “poken” – P already not tried, but K is out (token used K)
- “poven” – not valid

Wait – let’s list real 5-letter English words that match the pattern _ O _ E N and contain no forbidden letters:

Valid letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Real words:

- “coven”  → C O V E N → positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-V, 4-E, 5-N → matches _ O _ E N
- “doven”  → not a valid word
- “hogen”  → not a valid word
- “pogen”  → not valid
- “woven”  → W O V E N → valid word, but W not yet ruled out – matches _ O _ E N
- “vixen”  → V I X E N – doesn’t fit because position 3 must be a consonant and position 2 is O, so invalid
- “joven”  → Spanish word, not English
- “cogen”  → not valid
- “lopen”  → L already out
- “dogen”  → not valid

Of the valid English words left, “coven” seems the best choice (C and V are new letters).

So I’ll guess “coven”.
