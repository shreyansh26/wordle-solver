For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test as many possibilities as possible. Some good options include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

Letters known to exist in the word: A, E  
Positions ruled out for them:
- A is NOT in position 3.
- E is NOT in position 5.

Letters to avoid: S, L, T.

New guess should:
1. Include both A and E (known letters).
2. Avoid positions 3 for A and 5 for E.
3. Use only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T).
4. Prefer common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Possible consonants left: R, N, C, M, P, etc.
Vowels left: I, O, U.

A common pattern is to test vowel/consonant combos. A good candidate is “CRANE” but it uses R and N, and places A in position 3 (which is ruled out).  
Another candidate: “PEACE” – but E is in position 5 (ruled out).  
“EARLY” – contains L (ruled out).  
“ACRES” – contains S (ruled out).  
“PEACH” – uses P, E (must move E), A (must move A), C, H. A is in position 3 (ruled out).  
“REACH” – A is in position 3 (ruled out).  
“BREAD” – A is in position 3 (ruled out).  
“CLEAN” – A is in position 3 (ruled out).  
“OCEAN” – A is in position 4 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed). No ruled-out letters. This seems good.

So far:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, O, N.
- Letters known to be in the word: E, A and their positions from the latest feedback:
  – E is in position 3 (✓, correct).
  – A is somewhere not position 3 or 4 (because in OCEAN it was in position 4 and is still wrong position).

Structure we now know:
_ _ E _ _

Letters still allowed: all others except S, L, T, O, N.

We also know A must appear exactly once and must occupy either position 1, 2, or 5. (It cannot be in 3 or 4 because it was in 4 last guess and still marked wrong position.)

Good next step: pick a word that
1. keeps E in position 3,
2. places A in one of the remaining slots (1, 2, or 5),
3. introduces new common consonants (R, D, P, M, V, etc.).

Candidates meeting those rules:
- A D V E R
- P A R E D
- M A R E K
- C A R E D
- F A C E D (but C was “-” in OCEAN, so C is possible but not confirmed)
- F R E A K
- P E A K S (contains S – ruled out)
- G R E A T (contains T – ruled out)

“FREAK” works:
- E is in slot 3 (matches requirement),
- A is in slot 4 – but wait, that contradicts our deduction that A cannot be in 4. So scratch “FREAK”.

“CARED” works:
- C (allowed),
- A (allowed in 2),
- R (allowed),
- E (fixed in 3),
- D (allowed).

No ruled-out letters, A in position 2 is allowed. So “CARED”.

- E is not in positions 3, 4 (OCEAN had E in 3, marked ✓; CARED had E in 4, marked wrong – wait, no: OCEAN had E in 3, marked ✓ – that means E is fixed in position 3. So E is in position 3.

So the word form is: C _ E _ _

We still need to place A somewhere. Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5. But:
- A cannot be in 2 (from CARED feedback A(-) in 2)

A common letter to try in the 2nd position is H, forming CHE_A. ""CHEKA"" is a valid word, but might be obscure. Another common word in this pattern is ""CHESA"" – but ""CHESA"" isn't valid (no definition). Maybe ""CHEMA"" – also not a word.

Wait, we can look for common words fitting C _ E _ A.

Examples: CELIA, CECIA (not common), CERIA (no), CEVIC (no), CELLA (but L is out), CELSA (no), CESTA (but S is out), CEDIA (D is out), CEPHA (not common), CEVIC (no), CELIA (but L is out).

Hmm, L is ruled out (from SLATE). Let's think differently: possible second letter.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Let\'s check if letters are allowed: C, H, E, L, A. But L is ruled out (from SLATE L(x)), so CHELA is invalid.\n\nNext possible: ""CHEKA"" – K is allowed, letters: C, H, E, K, A.

From the new feedback:

Position map so far:
1: C (✓)  
2: H (✓)  
3: E (✓)  
4: ?  
5: ?  

Letters known to be in word: C, H, E  
Letters ruled out: S, L, T, O, N, R, D, K  
Additional: A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (last feedback shows A(-) in position 5).

So A must appear exactly once and can only sit in position 4, because:
- positions 1,2,3 are already fixed with C, H, E.
- position 5 is ruled out for A.

Therefore the word is C H E A _.

The only remaining slot is position 5.  
Allowed letters: any not yet ruled out (and not already used except A which must appear once and now is in 4).

Letters not yet used or ruled out: B, F, G, I, J, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z (plus others)  
But we need a common English word.

Common letters left: B, F, G, M, P, Y.

Try each:
- CHEAB – not a word  
- CHEAF – not a word  
- CHEAG – not a word  
- CHEAM – not a word  
- CHEAP – valid word and common. Letters: C, H, E, A, P. P is allowed.

Let me verify no conflicts:
- C ✓, H ✓, E ✓, A ✓, P (never tested).  
- All ruled-out letters avoided.

Thus the only valid common word left is “CHEAP”.
