For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information. A good strategy is to pick a word with several vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 very common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage of the most frequently used letters in English words.

The feedback for AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So our next word must:
- Include A (but not in the first position).
- Exclude R, O, S, E entirely.

1. Puts A in a new position (say 3rd or 4th).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A is in the word but not at position 1 (and R, O, S, E are not in the word).
2. PLAID → A is still “-”, so it is in the word but not at position 3 either.  
   Also, P, L, I, D are now ruled out.

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter A exactly once.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D are all absent.

Remaining common letters (not yet tested or ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: we have A confirmed; need to test U and maybe Y as a vowel substitute.

Since positions 1 and 3 are off-limits for A, the A must sit in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Let’s try to place A in position 2 and use other common untested consonants plus the vowel U.

Candidate: “MUMMY” – but that repeats M and Y, and no A.
Better candidate: “CAULK” – but K hasn’t been ruled out, and we have C, A, U, L, K. L is already ruled out.

3. JAUNT → A(✓), J, U, N, T are out  
   (so A is at position 2, and J, U, N, T are out).

Current certainties:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, J, U, N, T.

Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus second A or Y as vowel.

Possible pattern: _ A _ _ _

We still need more information on the remaining consonants.  
Let’s pick a word that keeps A in position 2 and adds four new untested consonants that are relatively common.

Good candidate: “CABBY”
- C, B, Y are all new; the double B is acceptable if allowed, but simpler to remove duplication.
Better candidate: “CAMBY” – but M,B,Y and no duplication.
Even cleaner: “CABIN” – but I/N already excluded.
Actually, simplest: “CABER” – but E/R excluded.

Clean choice that uses four fresh letters: “GAMMA” – but A repeated and M repeated.
Instead: “BACON” – B, C, O is excluded.

Clean, unique letters, none excluded except A stays: “HACKY”
- H, C, K, Y all new, A in position 2.

1. AROSE → A(-), R, O, S, E are out  
   (so A is in the word, but not at position 1).

2. PLAID → A(-), P, L, I, D are out

3. JAUNT → A(✓), J, U, N, T are out

Current certainties:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, J, U, N, T.

Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus second A or Y as vowel.

Possible pattern: _ A _ _ _

We still need more information on the remaining consonants.  
Let’s pick a word that keeps A in position 2 and adds four new untested consonants that are relatively common.

Good candidate: “CABBY”
- C, B, Y are all new; the double B is acceptable if allowed, but simpler to remove duplication.
Better candidate: “CAMBY” – but M,B,Y and no duplication.
Even cleaner: “CABIN” – but I/N already excluded.
Actually, simplest: “CABER” – but E/R excluded.

Clean choice that uses four fresh letters: “GAMMA” – but A repeated and M repeated.
Instead: “BACON” – B, C, O is excluded.

Clean, unique letters, none excluded except A stays: “HACKY”
- H, C, K, Y all new, A in position 2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with several vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 very common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage of the most frequently used letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So our next word must:
- Include A (but not in the first position).
- Exclude R, O, S, E entirely.

To squeeze as much information as possible, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Puts A in a new position (say 3rd or 4th).
2. Introduces several other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has A in the 3rd spot.
- It introduces P, L, I, D, none of which have been tested so far.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A is in the word but not at position 1 (and R, O, S, E are not in the word).
2. PLAID → A is still “-”, so it is in the word but not at position 3 either.  
   Also, P, L, I, D are now ruled out.

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter A exactly once.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D are all absent.

Remaining common letters (not yet tested or ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: we have A confirmed; need to test U and maybe Y as a vowel substitute.

Since positions 1 and 3 are off-limits for A, the A must sit in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Let’s try to place A in position 2 and use other common untested consonants plus the vowel U.

Candidate: “MUMMY” – but that repeats M and Y, and no A.
Better candidate: “CAULK” – but K hasn’t been ruled out, and we have C, A, U, L, K. L is already ruled out.
Next candidate: “JAUNT” – J, A, U, N, T. None have been ruled out except A is allowed.

We now know:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2) and Y (somewhere).
- Letters ruled out (x): R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, J, U, N, T, H, C, K.

Available letters: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z, plus vowels A (already placed) and possibly Y.

Y must appear at least once but can’t be in position 5 (because in HACKY it got ✓, meaning it is in the word but not in position 5). So Y could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We still need three more unique letters. Among the untested ones, B, F, G, M are common.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y (but we just saw Y can’t be at 5). So Y must be at 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s place Y at position 4 and fill the rest with fresh consonants:

Pattern: B A G Y ?

We need a fifth letter. Available: F, M, V, W, X, Z. Most common: M.

So we get “BAGYM” which isn’t a valid English word.

Try moving Y to position 1:

Y A _ _ _

Then positions 3,4,5 need three fresh consonants. Choose B, F, G:

Y A B F G — not a word.

Better: use B, F, M:

Y A B F M — also not a word.

Try Y at position 3:

_ A Y _ _

Positions 1,4,5: B, F, M — again not forming a common word.

Let’s try a simpler valid English word that fits the constraints:

B A _ _ Y

We need two more unique consonants from available: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z.

B A G M Y — not a word.

B A M F Y — not a word.

Try B A V Y M — not a word.

We seem stuck forming common words. Let’s try a systematic check for valid English words fitting the pattern _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2 and Y in 1,3, or 4 and no excluded letters.

After checking, the only valid remaining common word is:

M A B Y X — not valid.

Actually, let’s think of real words:

- G A M M Y — duplicate M, but G, A, M, M, Y — M is allowed, and Y is allowed. But M is not excluded. Let’s check: M is not in any of the x lists, so it’s okay. Also, G is okay. So “GAMMY” is a valid English word.

Check letters: G, A, M, M, Y.

- G: not excluded (not in any x list).
- A: confirmed at position 2.
- M: not excluded.
- M: duplicate, but allowed.
- Y: confirmed in word.

So “GAMMY” is a valid guess.

Let’s use “GAMMY”.

</think>

<guess>GAMMY</guess>",GAMMY,"We now know:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2) and Y (somewhere).
- Letters ruled out (x): R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, J, U, N, T, H, C, K.

Available letters: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z, plus vowels A (already placed) and possibly Y.

Y must appear at least once but can’t be in position 5 (because in HACKY it got ✓, meaning it is in the word but not in position 5). So Y could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We still need three more unique letters. Among the untested ones, B, F, G, M are common.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y (but we just saw Y can’t be at 5). So Y must be at 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s place Y at position 4 and fill the rest with fresh consonants:

Pattern: B A G Y ?

We need a fifth letter. Available: F, M, V, W, X, Z. Most common: M.

So we get “BAGYM” which isn’t a valid English word.

Try moving Y to position 1:

Y A _ _ _

Then positions 3,4,5 need three fresh consonants. Choose B, F, G:

Y A B F G — not a word.

Better: use B, F, M:

Y A B F M — also not a word.

Try Y at position 3:

_ A Y _ _

Positions 1,4,5: B, F, M — again not forming a common word.

Let’s try a simpler valid English word that fits the constraints:

B A _ _ Y

We need two more unique consonants from available: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick B A M B Y — duplicate B.

B A F M Y — not a word.

B A G M Y — not a word.

B A M F Y — not a word.

Try B A V Y M — not a word.

Try B A M M Y — duplicate M.

Try B A V M Y — still not a word.

Let’s think differently: use M in position 1:

M A _ _ Y

Positions 3,4: need two fresh consonants. Available: B, F, G, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick G and B:

M A G B Y — not a word.

We have:
- Position 2: A
- Must include Y, not at position 5
- Allowed consonants: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z

We seem stuck forming common words. Let’s try a systematic check for valid English words fitting the pattern _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2 and Y in 1,3, or 4 and no excluded letters.

After checking, the only valid remaining common word is:

M A B Y X — not valid.

Actually, let’s think of real words:

- G A M M Y — duplicate M, but G, A, M, M, Y — M is allowed, and Y is allowed. But M is not excluded. Let’s check: M is not in any of the x lists, so it’s okay. Also, G is okay. So “GAMMY” is a valid English word.

Check letters: G, A, M, M, Y.

- G: not excluded (not in any x list).
- A: confirmed at position 2.
- M: not excluded.
- M: duplicate, but allowed.
- Y: confirmed in word.

So “GAMMY” is a valid guess.

Let’s use “GAMMY”.",Guess 5: GAMMY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information. A good strategy is to pick a word with several vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 very common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage of the most frequently used letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So our next word must:
- Include A (but not in the first position).
- Exclude R, O, S, E entirely.

To squeeze as much information as possible, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Puts A in a new position (say 3rd or 4th).
2. Introduces several other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- It has A in the 3rd spot.
- It introduces P, L, I, D, none of which have been tested so far.

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A is in the word but not at position 1 (and R, O, S, E are not in the word).
2. PLAID → A is still “-”, so it is in the word but not at position 3 either.  
   Also, P, L, I, D are now ruled out.

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter A exactly once.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D are all absent.

Remaining common letters (not yet tested or ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: we have A confirmed; need to test U and maybe Y as a vowel substitute.

Since positions 1 and 3 are off-limits for A, the A must sit in positions 2, 4, or 5.
Let’s try to place A in position 2 and use other common untested consonants plus the vowel U.

Candidate: “MUMMY” – but that repeats M and Y, and no A.
Better candidate: “CAULK” – but K hasn’t been ruled out, and we have C, A, U, L, K. L is already ruled out.
Next candidate: “JAUNT” – J, A, U, N, T. None have been ruled out except A is allowed.

Let’s pick “JAUNT”.

Guess 3: JAUNT -> FEEDBACK: J(x) A(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R, O, S, E are out

2. PLAID → A(-), P, L, I, D are out  
   (so A is in the word, but not at position 3 either).

3. JAUNT → A(✓), J, U, N, T are out  
   (so A is at position 2, and J, U, N, T are out).

Current certainties:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, J, U, N, T.

Still-untested common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus second A or Y as vowel.

Possible pattern: _ A _ _ _

We still need more information on the remaining consonants.  
Let’s pick a word that keeps A in position 2 and adds four new untested consonants that are relatively common.

Good candidate: “CABBY”
- C, B, Y are all new; the double B is acceptable if allowed, but simpler to remove duplication.
Better candidate: “CAMBY” – but M,B,Y and no duplication.
Even cleaner: “CABIN” – but I/N already excluded.
Actually, simplest: “CABER” – but E/R excluded.

Clean choice that uses four fresh letters: “GAMMA” – but A repeated and M repeated.
Instead: “BACON” – B, C, O is excluded.

Clean, unique letters, none excluded except A stays: “HACKY”
- H, C, K, Y all new, A in position 2.

Let’s use “HACKY”.

Available letters: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z, plus vowels A (already placed) and possibly Y.

Y must appear at least once but can’t be in position 5 (because in HACKY it got ✓, meaning it is in the word but not in position 5). So Y could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We still need three more unique letters. Among the untested ones, B, F, G, M are common.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y (but we just saw Y can’t be at 5). So Y must be at 1 or 3 or 4.

Let’s place Y at position 4 and fill the rest with fresh consonants:

Pattern: B A G Y ?

We need a fifth letter. Available: F, M, V, W, X, Z. Most common: M.

So we get “BAGYM” which isn’t a valid English word.

Try moving Y to position 1:

Y A _ _ _

Then positions 3,4,5 need three fresh consonants. Choose B, F, G:

Y A B F G — not a word.

Better: use B, F, M:

Y A B F M — also not a word.

Try Y at position 3:

_ A Y _ _

Positions 1,4,5: B, F, M — again not forming a common word.

Let’s try a simpler valid English word that fits the constraints:

B A _ _ Y

We need two more unique consonants from available: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick B A M B Y — duplicate B.

B A F M Y — not a word.

B A G M Y — not a word.

B A M F Y — not a word.

Try B A V Y M — not a word.

Try B A M M Y — duplicate M.

Try B A V M Y — still not a word.

Let’s think differently: use M in position 1:

M A _ _ Y

Positions 3,4: need two fresh consonants. Available: B, F, G, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick G and B:

Let’s try a simpler approach: use only the most common remaining consonants and form a valid English word.

We have:
- Position 2: A
- Must include Y, not at position 5
- Allowed consonants: B, F, G, M, V, W, X, Z

Real valid 5-letter English words fitting these constraints:

- M A Y B E — E excluded.

We seem stuck forming common words. Let’s try a systematic check for valid English words fitting the pattern _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2 and Y in 1,3, or 4 and no excluded letters.

After checking, the only valid remaining common word is:

M A B Y X — not valid.

Actually, let’s think of real words:

- G A M M Y — duplicate M, but G, A, M, M, Y — M is allowed, and Y is allowed. But M is not excluded. Let’s check: M is not in any of the x lists, so it’s okay. Also, G is okay. So “GAMMY” is a valid English word.

Check letters: G, A, M, M, Y.

- G: not excluded (not in any x list).
- A: confirmed at position 2.
- M: not excluded.
- M: duplicate, but allowed.
- Y: confirmed in word.

So “GAMMY” is a valid guess.

Let’s use “GAMMY”.
