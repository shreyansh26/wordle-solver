For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideally, it should:
1. Use common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include some of these. 

Possible candidates: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This seems like a strong first guess to gather maximum information.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A (x) → A is not in the word.
R (x) → R is not in the word.
O (✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
S (x) → S is not in the word.
E (✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The third letter is O.
- The fifth letter is E.
- Letters A, R, S are definitely excluded.

We need a 5-letter word whose 3rd letter is O and 5th letter is E, and that uses none of A, R, S.

Looking for common words and letters that have not yet been tested, good remaining letters are: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Z.

Let’s try to cover new common consonants and vowels. A word like “TONEY” would fit (T, O, N, E, Y), but Y isn’t super common in this spot. “VOICE” uses V, O, I, C, E – but I and C are both common and untested, and it satisfies all constraints.

Check: V is OK (not A/R/S), O is in 3rd position, I and C are new, E is in 5th position. No A, R, or S. Seems good.

Let’s extract everything we know so far.

Known positions:
- Position 5 is definitely E.

Known letters:
- E is in the word (in position 5).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in VOICE and LODGE, meaning wrong position both times; since VOICE put it at position 2 and LODGE at 3, and both were wrong, the only remaining places are 1 or 4).  
  Note: in LODGE it was position 3 and marked “-”, so O is NOT in 3.  
  In VOICE it was position 2 and marked “-”, so O is NOT in 2.  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 4.

Excluded letters so far:
A, R, S, V, I, C, L, D, G (and we also know positions 2 and 3 cannot be O).

So the pattern is:

- _ _ _ O E

Letters still allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus E and O already used).  

To maximize information, let’s try a word that puts O in position 1 and uses several unused common consonants.

Let’s try to put O in position 4 instead.

We need three consonants (positions 1, 2, 3) that are not excluded.  
Allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include some of these. 

Possible candidates: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This seems like a strong first guess to gather maximum information.

A (x) → A is not in the word.
R (x) → R is not in the word.
O (✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
S (x) → S is not in the word.
E (✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The third letter is O.
- The fifth letter is E.
- Letters A, R, S are definitely excluded.

We need a 5-letter word whose 3rd letter is O and 5th letter is E, and that uses none of A, R, S.

Looking for common words and letters that have not yet been tested, good remaining letters are: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Z.

Let’s try to cover new common consonants and vowels. A word like “TONEY” would fit (T, O, N, E, Y), but Y isn’t super common in this spot. “VOICE” uses V, O, I, C, E – but I and C are both common and untested, and it satisfies all constraints.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with O somewhere other than position 3, and containing none of the banned letters.

Popular consonants we haven’t ruled out: D, N, T, L, H, M, G, B.  
A good next guess should try several of these and keep the O in a new position.

Let’s update what we know after the four guesses.

1. Positions and letters that are **correct**:
   - Position 5 is E (✓) – confirmed in every feedback.

2. Position of O:
   - Guess 1 (AROSE): O in position 3 → ✓ (correct letter and position).  
     Wait a minute – this seems to contradict later feedback. Let’s re-examine carefully:

   - Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
     This **explicitly** says O is in the word and in the **correct position** (position 3).  
     This is the only interpretation allowed by the rules: ✓ means correct **position**.

   - Guess 2: VOICE → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
     Here O is in position 2, marked “-” (in word but wrong position).  
     But O can’t simultaneously be in position 3 (from Guess 1) and also “in the word but wrong position” when placed in position 2.  
     This contradiction implies that the feedback for Guess 1 **must mean “O is in the word and correct in position 3”**, and in Guess 2 “-” just confirms O is in the word (not in position 2). No issue.

   - Guess 3: LODGE → L(x) O(-) D(x) G(-) E(✓)  
     Again O in position 3, marked “-” (wrong position).  
     This **directly contradicts** Guess 1, which said position 3 was correct.  
     This suggests the feedback might have been mis-transcribed. However, I will take the feedback exactly as given.

   - Guess 4: OZONE → O(-) Z(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓)  
     Here the first O (position 1) is “-” (in word, wrong position), the second O (position 3) is ✓ (correct position), and E is ✓ (position 5).  
     This **explicitly** reconfirms that **position 3 is O**.

Therefore, **position 3 = O** (✓ from Guess 1 and 4), and **position 5 = E** (✓ from every guess).

3. Letters excluded so far (marked “x” in any position):
   A, R, S, V, I, C, L, D, G, Z.

4. Letters still allowed:
   B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y.

5. Pattern so far:
   _ _ O _ E

6. Letters not yet ruled in/out:
   - Position 1 and 2: any of the allowed letters.
   - Position 4: must be one of the allowed consonants (since E is already fixed at 5).

7. To maximize information, pick a word that:
   - Has O in position 3, E in position 5.
   - Uses several new consonants in positions 1, 2, 4.
   - Is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:
   - B O N E E – invalid (repeats E).
   - F O N E – invalid (needs 5 letters).
   - M O N E T – ends in T, not E.
   - B O N E D – ends in D (excluded).
   - T O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.
   - H O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.
   - P O N E Y – ends in Y.
   - P O K E R – R excluded.
   - T O K E N – ends in N, but E is correct only in position 5, so this word ends in N, not E. So invalid.
   - F O R E – R excluded.
   - C O V E – C excluded.
   - M O P E D – ends in D excluded.
   - B O X E D – ends in D excluded.
   - J O K E R – R excluded.
   - M O T E L – ends in L excluded.
   - M O P E – too short.

Wait – we need 5 letters: _ _ O _ E.

Let’s list valid words that match _ _ O _ E and exclude banned letters.

Valid common words:
   - B O N E – no, needs 5 letters.
   - C H O K E – C excluded.
   - P O K E – too short.
   - S M O K E – S excluded.
   - F O C U S – not ending in E.
   - T O N E – too short.
   - P H O N E – P, H, O, N, E.  
     Check letters: P, H, N none are excluded.  
     Pattern: P H O N E → positions 3=O ✓, 5=E ✓, and uses new letters P, H, N.

This fits all constraints and uses three new consonants.

Therefore, the next guess is PHONE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include some of these. 

Possible candidates: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" uses five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This seems like a strong first guess to gather maximum information.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A (x) → A is not in the word.
R (x) → R is not in the word.
O (✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
S (x) → S is not in the word.
E (✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The third letter is O.
- The fifth letter is E.
- Letters A, R, S are definitely excluded.

We need a 5-letter word whose 3rd letter is O and 5th letter is E, and that uses none of A, R, S.

Looking for common words and letters that have not yet been tested, good remaining letters are: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Z.

Let’s try to cover new common consonants and vowels. A word like “TONEY” would fit (T, O, N, E, Y), but Y isn’t super common in this spot. “VOICE” uses V, O, I, C, E – but I and C are both common and untested, and it satisfies all constraints.

Check: V is OK (not A/R/S), O is in 3rd position, I and C are new, E is in 5th position. No A, R, or S. Seems good.

Let’s go with VOICE.

2. Third letter IS NOT O (because in VOICE the O is marked “-”: in the word but wrong spot).

4. Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z plus O (which must appear somewhere other than position 3) and E (already fixed in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with O somewhere other than position 3, and containing none of the banned letters.

Popular consonants we haven’t ruled out: D, N, T, L, H, M, G, B.  
A good next guess should try several of these and keep the O in a new position.

Candidate word: “TONG E” – but “ton ge” isn’t a word.  
Check real words: “PHONE” has H, P, N, O, E – but P is allowed, O can slide to position 2 or 4; position 2 in PHONE is O – allowed (not 3rd).  
Another candidate: “MOTEL” – ends in L, not E.  
“GONER” – has R, banned.  
“BONEY” – ends in Y, not E.  
“LODGE” – ends in E, but has D,G; O is in position 2 – allowed.  
“LODGE” uses L, O, D, G, E – none of the banned letters, satisfies constraints.

Let’s use LODGE.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract everything we know so far.

Known positions:
- Position 5 is definitely E.

Known letters:
- E is in the word (in position 5).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in VOICE and LODGE, meaning wrong position both times; since VOICE put it at position 2 and LODGE at 3, and both were wrong, the only remaining places are 1 or 4).  
  Note: in LODGE it was position 3 and marked “-”, so O is NOT in 3.  
  In VOICE it was position 2 and marked “-”, so O is NOT in 2.  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 4.

Excluded letters so far:
A, R, S, V, I, C, L, D, G (and we also know positions 2 and 3 cannot be O).

So the pattern is:

_ _ _ _ E  
with O in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ E
- _ _ _ O E

Letters still allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus E and O already used).  

To maximize information, let’s try a word that puts O in position 1 and uses several unused common consonants.

Candidate: OMBRE  
- Starts with O (new position).  
- Uses M, B, R.  
But R is already excluded (from AROSE), so NO.

Next candidate: OLIVE – uses I and V, both excluded.

Next candidate: ONSET – uses N, S, T.  
But S is excluded.  

Next candidate: OPINE – uses P, I, N.  
I is excluded.  

Next candidate: OZONE – uses Z, N.  
Z and N are both allowed.  
Check letters: O, Z, O, N, E – but repeats O, which is allowed since we only know one O exists. However it’s not ideal to repeat letters.  

Let’s try to put O in position 4 instead.  
Pattern: _ _ _ O E.

We need three consonants (positions 1, 2, 3) that are not excluded.  
Allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting: MONEY – uses M, N, Y.  
Check: M, O, N, E, Y – positions 4 is O and 5 is E – but wait:  
M O N E Y – O is in position 2, which we know is wrong (from VOICE). So NO.

Next candidate: TONER – but R is excluded.

Next: HOMER – uses H, M, R – R excluded.

Next: BONER – uses B, N, R – R excluded.

Next: POKER – uses P, K, R – R excluded.

Next: WOKEN – uses W, K, E, N – but ends in N, not E.

Next: FOXED – uses F, X, D – D excluded.

Next: JOKER – uses J, K, R – R excluded.

Next: YOKED – uses Y, K, D – D excluded.

Next: ZONER – uses Z, N, R – R excluded.

Next: COBRA – ends in A, not E, and R excluded.

Next: TONED – ends in D, excluded.

Next: CONEY – ends in Y, not E.

Next: POKED – ends in D, excluded.

Hmm, let’s reconsider a possible word starting with O.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate: OFTEN – uses F, T, N.

But E must be in position 5, so this word ends in N, not E. So NO.

Candidate: OMBRE – already had R.

Candidate: OUTER – uses U, T, R – R excluded.

Candidate: OTTER – uses T, T, R – R excluded.

Candidate: OATER – uses A, E, T – A excluded.

Candidate: OXIDE – uses X, I, D – I and D excluded.

Candidate: ONSET – uses N, S, T – S excluded.

Candidate: OMBER – uses M, B, R – R excluded.

Candidate: OUPHE – uses U, P, H – this is obscure.

Next candidate: OMBER – R excluded.

Next candidate: OUPHE – rare.

Next candidate: OXBOW – ends in W.

Next candidate: OZONE – uses Z, N, E – letters: O, Z, O, N, E.  
O is in position 1 (allowed), Z and N are new, E in position 5.  
No excluded letters, and fits pattern O _ _ _ E.

Let’s use OZONE.

<guess>OZONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: VOICE -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: LODGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(-) D(x) G(-) E(✓)
Guess 4: OZONE -> FEEDBACK: O(-) Z(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after the four guesses.

1. Positions and letters that are **correct**:
   - Position 5 is E (✓) – confirmed in every feedback.

2. Position of O:
   - Guess 1 (AROSE): O in position 3 → ✓ (correct letter and position).  
     Wait a minute – this seems to contradict later feedback. Let’s re-examine carefully:

   - Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
     This **explicitly** says O is in the word and in the **correct position** (position 3).  
     This is the only interpretation allowed by the rules: ✓ means correct **position**.

   - Guess 2: VOICE → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
     Here O is in position 2, marked “-” (in word but wrong position).  
     But O can’t simultaneously be in position 3 (from Guess 1) and also “in the word but wrong position” when placed in position 2.  
     This contradiction implies that the feedback for Guess 1 **must mean “O is in the word and correct in position 3”**, and in Guess 2 “-” just confirms O is in the word (not in position 2). No issue.

   - Guess 3: LODGE → L(x) O(-) D(x) G(-) E(✓)  
     Again O in position 3, marked “-” (wrong position).  
     This **directly contradicts** Guess 1, which said position 3 was correct.  
     This suggests the feedback might have been mis-transcribed. However, I will take the feedback exactly as given.

   - Guess 4: OZONE → O(-) Z(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓)  
     Here the first O (position 1) is “-” (in word, wrong position), the second O (position 3) is ✓ (correct position), and E is ✓ (position 5).  
     This **explicitly** reconfirms that **position 3 is O**.

Therefore, **position 3 = O** (✓ from Guess 1 and 4), and **position 5 = E** (✓ from every guess).

3. Letters excluded so far (marked “x” in any position):
   A, R, S, V, I, C, L, D, G, Z.

4. Letters still allowed:
   B, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y.

5. Pattern so far:
   _ _ O _ E

6. Letters not yet ruled in/out:
   - Position 1 and 2: any of the allowed letters.
   - Position 4: must be one of the allowed consonants (since E is already fixed at 5).

7. To maximize information, pick a word that:
   - Has O in position 3, E in position 5.
   - Uses several new consonants in positions 1, 2, 4.
   - Is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:
   - B O N E E – invalid (repeats E).
   - F O N E – invalid (needs 5 letters).
   - M O N E T – ends in T, not E.
   - B O N E D – ends in D (excluded).
   - T O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.
   - H O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.
   - P O N E Y – ends in Y.
   - P O K E R – R excluded.
   - T O K E N – ends in N, but E is correct only in position 5, so this word ends in N, not E. So invalid.
   - F O R E – R excluded.
   - C O V E – C excluded.
   - M O P E D – ends in D excluded.
   - B O X E D – ends in D excluded.
   - J O K E R – R excluded.
   - M O T E L – ends in L excluded.
   - M O P E – too short.

Wait – we need 5 letters: _ _ O _ E.

Let’s list valid words that match _ _ O _ E and exclude banned letters.

Valid common words:
   - B O N E – no, needs 5 letters.
   - C H O K E – C excluded.
   - P O K E – too short.
   - S M O K E – S excluded.
   - F O C U S – not ending in E.
   - T O N E – too short.
   - P H O N E – P, H, O, N, E.  
     Check letters: P, H, N none are excluded.  
     Pattern: P H O N E → positions 3=O ✓, 5=E ✓, and uses new letters P, H, N.

This fits all constraints and uses three new consonants.

Therefore, the next guess is PHONE.

Consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Positions that are definitely correct:
   - Position 3 = O  (marked ✓ in three separate guesses).
   - Position 5 = E  (always ✓).

2. Letters that are NOT in the word (marked x at least once):
   A, R, S, V, I, C, L, D, G, Z, P, H

3. Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - N has appeared twice marked “-” (in OZONE and PHONE), so N is in the word but **not** in position 4.

4. Pattern so far:
   _ _ O _ E   with N somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

5. Allowed letters left (consonants & vowels not yet ruled out):
   B, F, J, K, M, Q, T, U, W, X, Y  (plus we already have O and E fixed).

6. We need a real 5-letter word matching:
   - Ends in O _ E  (positions 3-5)
   - Contains N in position 1 or 2
   - Uses only letters from the still-allowed set

Possible templates:
   N _ O _ E   or   _ N O _ E

Look for common words:

- N O O S E – repeats O.
- N O V E L – V excluded.
- N O M A D – A excluded.
- N O T E S – S excluded.
- N O B L E – B, L; L excluded.
- N O M E N – ends in N.
- K N O T S – S excluded.
- K N O W N – ends in N.
- B N O E _ – no.
- M N O … – unlikely.

A valid, common word that fits:
   M O N E Y – but ends in Y, not E.

Next word that fits:
   N O O N – too short.

Wait – a real word:  **B O N E** – too short.

Another real word: **M O N E Y** – ends in Y, not E.

Another: **T O N E** – too short.

Another: **K N O T** – too short.

Another: **B O N E** – too short.

Let me systematically list real 5-letter words ending in “_ _ O _ E” with N in 1 or 2:

- N E O N E – not a word.
- N I K E – wrong.
- N O B L E – B allowed, L excluded.
- N O M E N – ends in N.
- N O T E D – D excluded.
- N O S E D – S excluded.
- N O V E L – V excluded.

Actually, the only common remaining word that fits the template and uses allowed letters is:

   M O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.

But we need the last letter to be E.

Re-examine: _ _ O _ E with N in 1 or 2.

List of real 5-letter words fitting this exact pattern and using only still-allowed letters:

After filtering, the only common English word that satisfies:
- positions 3=O, 5=E
- contains N in 1 or 2
- uses only letters B, F, J, K, M, Q, T, U, W, X, Y plus N

is:

**M O N E Y** – but ends in Y.  Discard.

**T O N E** – too short.

**B O N E** – too short.

**C H O K E** – C, H excluded.

Wait – another possibility: **N O M E** – too short.

Finally, we find:

**N O M E N** – ends in N, not E.

Seems none left?  Let me double-check.

Actually, there is one valid, common word:

**N O M E N** – but ends in N.

Real word fitting exactly: **K N O T E** – but ends in E, uses K, N, O, T, E.

Check letters:
K, N, O, T, E – none are excluded.
Positions: N in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (correct), E in 5 (correct).

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is KNOTE.

- N O T E S – S excluded.
- N O B L E – B, L; L excluded.
- N O M E N – ends in N.
- K N O T S – S excluded.
- K N O W N – ends in N.
- B N O E _ – no.
- M N O … – unlikely.

A valid, common word that fits:
   M O N E Y – but ends in Y, not E.

Next word that fits:
   N O O N – too short.

Wait – a real word:  **B O N E** – too short.

Another real word: **M O N E Y** – ends in Y, not E.

Another: **T O N E** – too short.

Another: **K N O T** – too short.

Another: **B O N E** – too short.

Let me systematically list real 5-letter words ending in “_ _ O _ E” with N in 1 or 2:

- N E O N E – not a word.
- N I K E – wrong.
- N O B L E – B allowed, L excluded.
- N O M E N – ends in N.
- N O T E D – D excluded.
- N O S E D – S excluded.
- N O V E L – V excluded.

Actually, the only common remaining word that fits the template and uses allowed letters is:

   M O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.

But we need the last letter to be E.

Re-examine: _ _ O _ E with N in 1 or 2.

List of real 5-letter words fitting this exact pattern and using only still-allowed letters:

After filtering, the only common English word that satisfies:
- positions 3=O, 5=E
- contains N in 1 or 2
- uses only letters B, F, J, K, M, Q, T, U, W, X, Y plus N

is:

**M O N E Y** – but ends in Y.  Discard.

**T O N E** – too short.

**B O N E** – too short.

**C H O K E** – C, H excluded.

Wait – another possibility: **N O M E** – too short.

Finally, we find:

**N O M E N** – ends in N, not E.

Seems none left?  Let me double-check.

Actually, there is one valid, common word:

**N O M E N** – but ends in N.

Real word fitting exactly: **K N O T E** – but ends in E, uses K, N, O, T, E.

Check letters:
K, N, O, T, E – none are excluded.
Positions: N in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (correct), E in 5 (correct).

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is KNOTE.

<guess>KNOTE</guess>",Guess 6: KNOTE -> FEEDBACK: K(x) N(✓) O(✓) T(x) E(✓),FAIL
