For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover multiple of these letters without repeating any.

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters. However, other good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""CRANE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - hitting several high-frequency letters including the two most common vowels (A and E) and two very common consonants (R and S).

After the third guess EARLY we have new positional information:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word and IS in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- L and Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know the word:
- Has A in spot 2 ( _ A _ _ _ )
- Also contains E and R somewhere else
- Does NOT contain O, S, C, T, L, Y
- Needs two more letters (which have not been tried yet)

Possible positions for E and R:
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from prior feedback), so E can be 1, 3 or 4. But from EARLY feedback we also know E is NOT in position 1. So E must be in 3 or 4.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from prior feedback), so R must be in 4 or 5.

We need two new letters. Common consonants not yet tested: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc. Common vowel not yet tested: I, U.

Let’s try to fit:
 _ A _ _ _
 with E in 3 or 4 and R in 4 or 5.

Option 1: E in 3 and R in 5 → _ A E _ R → need one more letter in position 4.
Option 2: E in 4 and R in 5 → _ A _ E R → need one more letter in position 3.

Let’s explore Option 1: _ A E _ R → we need a consonant in position 4.
Common unused consonants: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.
Try ""N"": NAER? but that would be ""NAER_"" which isn't a word.
Try ""D"": ""EAD"" is not common.
Try ""P"": ""PAER"" – not a word.
Try ""B"": ""BAER"" – not common.
Try ""G"": ""GAER"" – not common.

Option 2: _ A _ E R → need a consonant in position 3.
We have _ A _ E R. The missing letter is position 3.
Let’s try ""D"": ""D A E E R"" – double E, unlikely.
Try ""N"": ""N A E E R"" – double E.
Wait, we only have one E in the word (since we have A, R, E as separate letters).
So the pattern is _ A _ E R with one E and one R already placed.

We need a consonant in position 3 (and position 1 is still open). But we have only 5 letters total, so the word would be: [letter] A [letter] E R.

But we have only A, R, E known, and need two more letters. Let me rephrase:

We have 3 known letters (A, R, E) and two unknown letters (from the unused set). The word has A in position 2.

Possible positions:
A is fixed in position 2.
E must be in 3 or 4 (from above).
R must be in 4 or 5 (from above).

Let’s try:
- E in 3, R in 4: _ A E R _ (need one more letter in position 1 or 5)
- E in 3, R in 5: _ A E _ R (need one more letter in position 1 or 4)
- E in 4, R in 5: _ A _ E R (need one more letter in position 1 or 3)

Let’s pick E in 4 and R in 5: _ A _ E R
We need a consonant in position 3 and a consonant in position 1 (or same consonant twice, but unlikely).
Common consonants left: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.
Try ""P"" in position 3: _ A P E R – ""PAPER"" but that has two P's and we haven't used P yet.
Wait, no, ""PAPER"" is 5 letters: P A P E R – but we have A in position 2, so P A P E R would have A in 2, but we don't know if P is in word.
But we need to introduce new letters. Let’s try ""B"" in position 3: _ A B E R – ""BABER""? Not common.
Try ""D"" in position 3: _ A D E R – ""DADER""? Not common.
Try ""N"" in position 3: _ A N E R – ""NANER""? Not common.
Try ""M"" in position 3: _ A M E R – ""MAMER""? Not common.
Try ""H"" in position 3: _ A H E R – ""HAHER""? Not common.

Alternative approach: E in 3, R in 5: _ A E _ R
We need a consonant in position 4 and possibly position 1.
Let’s try ""D"" in position 4: _ A E D R – ""AEDR"" not a word.
Try ""N"" in position 4: _ A E N R – ""AENR"" not a word.
Try ""P"" in position 4: _ A E P R – ""AEPR"" not a word.
Try ""B"" in position 4: _ A E B R – ""AEBR"" not a word.

Wait, we can have both new letters at once. Let’s try:
Pattern: [Consonant] A [Consonant] E R
Let’s pick consonants: N and D.
""N A D E R"" – ""NADER"" – but that has D in 3, E in 4, R in 5, A in 2, N in 1.
Check if all letters are allowed: N, A, D, E, R – none of O,S,C,T,L,Y are present.
This seems possible.

Let’s test ""NADER"":
- N is new
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY)
- D is new
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E cannot be 2 or 5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be 1,2,3)

This seems like a valid and common word.

With A locked in position 2, and the constraints that:
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (not 1,2,5)
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1,2,3)

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover multiple of these letters without repeating any.

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters. However, other good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""CRANE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - hitting several high-frequency letters including the two most common vowels (A and E) and two very common consonants (R and S).

- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E appears in the word but is in the wrong position (not 5th).

- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.
- We still need to find two more letters (since we have 3 letters confirmed and need 5 total).

Looking for a new word that:

Summary of what we know for sure:

- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A: not 1 or 3
  – R: not 1 or 2
  – E: not 2 or 5
- We still need two more distinct letters (the word is 5 letters long).

Looking for common consonants not yet tested: N, D, L, H, M, P, etc.
We also need a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out (I and U are still possible).

A good next word should:
- contain A, R, E in the remaining possible positions
- introduce at least one new letter from the set {N,D,L,H,M,P,I,U}
- avoid any of the forbidden letters (O,S,C,T)

Candidate positions for A, R, E:
- A can be 2, 4, 5
- R can be 3, 4, 5
- E can be 1, 3, 4

Let’s test “EARLY”:
E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- Uses A, R, E in new positions
- Introduces L and Y
- Avoids O, S, C, T
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y

Check constraints:
- A in position 2: allowed (only excluded from 1 and 3)
- R in position 3: allowed (only excluded from 1 and 2)

Try ""D"" in position 3: _ A D E R – ""DADER""? Not common.
Try ""N"" in position 3: _ A N E R – ""NANER""? Not common.
Try ""M"" in position 3: _ A M E R – ""MAMER""? Not common.
Try ""H"" in position 3: _ A H E R – ""HAHER""? Not common.

Alternative approach: E in 3, R in 5: _ A E _ R
We need a consonant in position 4 and possibly position 1.
Let’s try ""D"" in position 4: _ A E D R – ""AEDR"" not a word.
Try ""N"" in position 4: _ A E N R – ""AENR"" not a word.
Try ""P"" in position 4: _ A E P R – ""AEPR"" not a word.
Try ""B"" in position 4: _ A E B R – ""AEBR"" not a word.

Wait, we can have both new letters at once. Let’s try:
Pattern: [Consonant] A [Consonant] E R
Let’s pick consonants: N and D.
""N A D E R"" – ""NADER"" – but that has D in 3, E in 4, R in 5, A in 2, N in 1.
Check if all letters are allowed: N, A, D, E, R – none of O,S,C,T,L,Y are present.
This seems possible.

Let’s test ""NADER"":
- N is new
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY)
- D is new
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E cannot be 2 or 5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be 1,2,3)

This seems like a valid and common word.With A locked in position 2, and the constraints that:
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (not 1,2,5)
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1,2,3)
- We need two new consonants (from N, D, H, M, P, B, G)

A word that fits is NADER:

3. R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓) (from NADER feedback).

So the known pattern is:

We still need two more letters:

- Letters used so far: A, E, R – all others from the alphabet are still possible except the ones we’ve ruled out (O,S,C,T,L,Y,N,D).
- Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U.

Let’s try to pick uncommon but still valid letters to fill positions 1 and 3. Let’s try:
- Position 1: F
- Position 3: G
This gives us the word F A G E R – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next, let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: G
This gives B A G E R – which is a valid English word (a type of animal, or someone who bags things).

Check constraints:
- B and G are new letters, not previously ruled out.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover multiple of these letters without repeating any.

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters. However, other good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""CRANE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - hitting several high-frequency letters including the two most common vowels (A and E) and two very common consonants (R and S).

Summary of what we know for sure:

- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – A: not 1 or 3
  – R: not 1 or 2
  – E: not 2 or 5
- We still need two more distinct letters (the word is 5 letters long).

Looking for common consonants not yet tested: N, D, L, H, M, P, etc.
We also need a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out (I and U are still possible).

A good next word should:
- contain A, R, E in the remaining possible positions
- introduce at least one new letter from the set {N,D,L,H,M,P,I,U}
- avoid any of the forbidden letters (O,S,C,T)

Candidate positions for A, R, E:
- A can be 2, 4, 5
- R can be 3, 4, 5
- E can be 1, 3, 4

Let’s test “EARLY”:
E(1), A(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5)
- Uses A, R, E in new positions
- Introduces L and Y
- Avoids O, S, C, T
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y

Check constraints:
- A in position 2: allowed (only excluded from 1 and 3)
- R in position 3: allowed (only excluded from 1 and 2)
- E in position 1: allowed (only excluded from 2 and 5)
- L and Y have not been tested yet

So far we know the word:
- Has A in spot 2 ( _ A _ _ _ )
- Also contains E and R somewhere else
- Does NOT contain O, S, C, T, L, Y
- Needs two more letters (which have not been tried yet)

Possible positions for E and R:
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from prior feedback), so E can be 1, 3 or 4. But from EARLY feedback we also know E is NOT in position 1. So E must be in 3 or 4.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from prior feedback), so R must be in 4 or 5.

We need two new letters. Common consonants not yet tested: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc. Common vowel not yet tested: I, U.

Let’s try to fit:
 _ A _ _ _
 with E in 3 or 4 and R in 4 or 5.

Option 1: E in 3 and R in 5 → _ A E _ R → need one more letter in position 4.
Option 2: E in 4 and R in 5 → _ A _ E R → need one more letter in position 3.

Let’s explore Option 1: _ A E _ R → we need a consonant in position 4.
Common unused consonants: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.
Try ""N"": NAER? but that would be ""NAER_"" which isn't a word.
Try ""D"": ""EAD"" is not common.
Try ""P"": ""PAER"" – not a word.
Try ""B"": ""BAER"" – not common.
Try ""G"": ""GAER"" – not common.

Option 2: _ A _ E R → need a consonant in position 3.
We have _ A _ E R. The missing letter is position 3.
Let’s try ""D"": ""D A E E R"" – double E, unlikely.
Try ""N"": ""N A E E R"" – double E.
Wait, we only have one E in the word (since we have A, R, E as separate letters).
So the pattern is _ A _ E R with one E and one R already placed.

We need a consonant in position 3 (and position 1 is still open). But we have only 5 letters total, so the word would be: [letter] A [letter] E R.

But we have only A, R, E known, and need two more letters. Let me rephrase:

We have 3 known letters (A, R, E) and two unknown letters (from the unused set). The word has A in position 2.

Possible positions:
A is fixed in position 2.
E must be in 3 or 4 (from above).
R must be in 4 or 5 (from above).

Let’s try:
- E in 3, R in 4: _ A E R _ (need one more letter in position 1 or 5)
- E in 3, R in 5: _ A E _ R (need one more letter in position 1 or 4)
- E in 4, R in 5: _ A _ E R (need one more letter in position 1 or 3)

Let’s pick E in 4 and R in 5: _ A _ E R
We need a consonant in position 3 and a consonant in position 1 (or same consonant twice, but unlikely).
Common consonants left: N, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.
Try ""P"" in position 3: _ A P E R – ""PAPER"" but that has two P's and we haven't used P yet.
Wait, no, ""PAPER"" is 5 letters: P A P E R – but we have A in position 2, so P A P E R would have A in 2, but we don't know if P is in word.
But we need to introduce new letters. Let’s try ""B"" in position 3: _ A B E R – ""BABER""? Not common.
Try ""D"" in position 3: _ A D E R – ""DADER""? Not common.
Try ""N"" in position 3: _ A N E R – ""NANER""? Not common.
Try ""M"" in position 3: _ A M E R – ""MAMER""? Not common.
Try ""H"" in position 3: _ A H E R – ""HAHER""? Not common.

Alternative approach: E in 3, R in 5: _ A E _ R
We need a consonant in position 4 and possibly position 1.
Let’s try ""D"" in position 4: _ A E D R – ""AEDR"" not a word.
Try ""N"" in position 4: _ A E N R – ""AENR"" not a word.
Try ""P"" in position 4: _ A E P R – ""AEPR"" not a word.
Try ""B"" in position 4: _ A E B R – ""AEBR"" not a word.

Wait, we can have both new letters at once. Let’s try:
Pattern: [Consonant] A [Consonant] E R
Let’s pick consonants: N and D.
""N A D E R"" – ""NADER"" – but that has D in 3, E in 4, R in 5, A in 2, N in 1.
Check if all letters are allowed: N, A, D, E, R – none of O,S,C,T,L,Y are present.
This seems possible.

Let’s test ""NADER"":
- N is new
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY)
- D is new
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E cannot be 2 or 5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be 1,2,3)

This seems like a valid and common word.With A locked in position 2, and the constraints that:
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (not 1,2,5)
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (not 1,2,3)
- We need two new consonants (from N, D, H, M, P, B, G)

A word that fits is NADER:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
Guess 3: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: NADER -> FEEDBACK: N(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list everything we now know.

1. A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
2. E is in the word and is in position 4 (✓) (from NADER feedback).
3. R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓) (from NADER feedback).
4. Letters we have ruled out so far: O, S, C, T, L, Y, N, D.

So the known pattern is:
 _  A  _  E  R

We still need two more letters:
- Position 1 and position 3.
- Letters used so far: A, E, R – all others from the alphabet are still possible except the ones we’ve ruled out (O,S,C,T,L,Y,N,D).
- Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U.

Let’s try to pick uncommon but still valid letters to fill positions 1 and 3. Let’s try:
- Position 1: F
- Position 3: G
This gives us the word F A G E R – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next, let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: G
This gives B A G E R – which is a valid English word (a type of animal, or someone who bags things).

Check constraints:
- B and G are new letters, not previously ruled out.
- Positions:
  - 1: B (allowed)
  - 2: A (✓)
  - 3: G (allowed)
  - 4: E (✓)
  - 5: R (✓)

This seems perfect.
