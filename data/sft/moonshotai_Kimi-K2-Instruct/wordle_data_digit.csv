- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize letter coverage
3. Include vowels (especially common ones like A, E, I)

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels and two very common consonants (R and S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From Guess 1 (ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)) we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, E  
2. Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong position (-): I  
3. Letters we have no info on yet: any letters not in A,R,I,S,E

Since I is in the word but not in position 3, I need a word that:
- has I in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5)
- avoids A, R, S, E
- contains as many other common letters as possible to maximize information

Good candidates:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – but L is not super common
- UNITY (U, N, I, T, Y) – Y is a vowel-like letter
- UNTIL vs UNITY: UNITY uses Y (a vowel alternative) and gives info on N,T,U,Y

I'll choose UNITY because it tests N, T, U, Y and places I in position 3 (though it was originally in position 3, I need to move it elsewhere - let's double check)

Wait - in ARISE, I was in position 3 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So UNITY places I in position 3 again, which violates the feedback. Let me pick a word where I is NOT in position 3.

Better options:
- LIMIT (but has M and T, but repeats I)
- PINTO (but has R and S excluded)
- CIVIL (has L and V, but repeats I)
- QUICK (Q is too rare)
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – I is position 3 again
- BIKER (has E,R excluded)
- VINYL (V, I, N, Y, L) – I is position 2 (good, not 3)

VINYL looks good:
- Contains I in position 2 (not 3)
- Avoids A,R,S,E
- Tests V, N, Y, L

Another option: DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – but H is less common
Going with VINYL as it tests more distinct letters.

But let me check if VINYL is a good choice - V and Y are less common. Maybe DITCH is better with high frequency consonants D,T,C,H and I moved to position 2.

Actually, better: INPUT
- I in position 1 (not position 3)
- Tests N, P, U, T
- Avoids A,R,S,E

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize letter coverage
3. Include vowels (especially common ones like A, E, I)

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels and two very common consonants (R and S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)) we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, E  
2. Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong position (-): I  
3. Letters we have no info on yet: any letters not in A,R,I,S,E

Since I is in the word but not in position 3, I need a word that:
- has I in a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5)
- avoids A, R, S, E
- contains as many other common letters as possible to maximize information

Good candidates:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – but L is not super common
- UNITY (U, N, I, T, Y) – Y is a vowel-like letter
- UNTIL vs UNITY: UNITY uses Y (a vowel alternative) and gives info on N,T,U,Y

I'll choose UNITY because it tests N, T, U, Y and places I in position 3 (though it was originally in position 3, I need to move it elsewhere - let's double check)

Wait - in ARISE, I was in position 3 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So UNITY places I in position 3 again, which violates the feedback. Let me pick a word where I is NOT in position 3.

Better options:
- LIMIT (but has M and T, but repeats I)
- PINTO (but has R and S excluded)
- CIVIL (has L and V, but repeats I)
- QUICK (Q is too rare)
- BUILT (B, U, I, L, T) – I is position 3 again
- BIKER (has E,R excluded)
- VINYL (V, I, N, Y, L) – I is position 2 (good, not 3)

VINYL looks good:
- Contains I in position 2 (not 3)
- Avoids A,R,S,E
- Tests V, N, Y, L

Another option: DITCH (D, I, T, C, H) – but H is less common
Going with VINYL as it tests more distinct letters.

But let me check if VINYL is a good choice - V and Y are less common. Maybe DITCH is better with high frequency consonants D,T,C,H and I moved to position 2.

Actually, better: INPUT
- I in position 1 (not position 3)
- Tests N, P, U, T
- Avoids A,R,S,E

This seems optimal.

- : I (Guess 1 and 2 showed I in wrong positions, Guess 3 nailed it at position 2)

Therefore the secret word has the pattern:  
_ I G _ T  
with the remaining letters drawn from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ I G _ T.

Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct position  
✓ : I in position 2, G in position 3, T in position 5  

Letters that appear but are not yet in the correct position  
- : T (in Guess 3 it appears in position 1, and we already know T is correct in position 5, so this simply confirms T is only in position 5)  
- : I (Guess 1 and 2 showed I in wrong positions, Guess 3 nailed it at position 2)

Therefore the secret word has the pattern:  
_ I G _ T  
with the remaining letters drawn from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ I G _ T.  
Obvious candidates:  
DIGIT – D, I, G, I, T … but repeats I (and we have no evidence of a second I)  
FIGHT – F, I, G, H, T … H is already ruled out  
LIGHT – L, I, G, H, T … H is ruled out  
MIGHT – M, I, G, H, T … H is ruled out  
WIGHT – W ruled out (H already out)  
VIGIL – ends with L not T  
BIGOT – B, I, G, O, T … O is still allowed  
CIGAR – ends with R, R is out  
The only remaining common word that fits is BIGOT.

Check:  
B (not ruled out)  
I (correct at 2)  
G (correct at 3)  
O (not ruled out)  
T (correct at 5)

So the next logical guess is BIGOT.
