For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common and uses frequent letters to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice as it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. These letters appear frequently in English words and cover both vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S). Using this as my starting point will help eliminate or confirm many possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.
- R(✓) – the letter R is in the word and already in its correct (second) position.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _

We need to try a word that:
1. Contains R in the second position (already satisfied).
2. Uses none of the already-eliminated letters A, O, S, E.
3. Introduces new, common letters to find the remaining four positions.

Good consonants to test next include T, N, L, C, D and good vowels include I, U.  
A straightforward word satisfying these rules is “TRIED”: T, R, I, E, D.  
However, E is already ruled out, so “TRIED” is invalid.  
“TRUCK” has U and C, but we’ve already ruled out U (no, we haven’t—only A, O, S, E are out).  
Let’s pick “TRI” as the start and find a valid ending.  
A valid word that keeps R in position 2 and avoids A, O, S, E is “TRIP” (too short).  
Another candidate: “DRIFT” – but it has an F and uses D, R, I, F, T.  
Wait, that’s 5 letters; it avoids A, O, S, E and keeps R in position 2? No, R is in position 1.  

Instead, let’s build something like “FRUIT” – but U and I are fine, F, R, U, I, T.  
However, R is not in position 2 here.  

Let’s list possible patterns: _ R _ _ _  
We need 5-letter words with R in the second spot, excluding A, O, S, E.  
Examples:  
- BRIEF (E eliminated) – no  
- CRISP (S eliminated) – no  
- DRIFT – R is in position 2, letters D, R, I, F, T. None of these (aside from R) are ruled out.  

So “DRIFT” fits.  

Another: “GRIND” (G, R, I, N, D) – also fits.  

Between these, “DRIFT” is more common. I’ll go with that.

Current confirmed information:
1. Word pattern: _ R I _ _ (R at position 2 ✓, I at position 3 ✓).
2. Eliminated letters: A, O, S, E (from #1) + D, F, T (from #2) + K (from #3).
3. New info from PRICK:
   - P: in word but wrong position (must appear somewhere else, not position 1).
   - C: in word but wrong position (must appear somewhere else, not position 4).

Possible positions for P and C:
- P can be at 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is I, so P is at 4 or 5.
- C can be at 1, 4, or 5. But 2 and 3 are R and I, so C is at 1, 4, or 5.

But P and C cannot both be at 4 or 5 simultaneously (since they must each occupy distinct positions).

Let’s list possible words matching _ R I _ _ with remaining letters (excluding eliminated ones):
Valid remaining letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Candidate words:
1. PRIM_: P must be elsewhere (not pos 1), so PRIM_ is invalid (P at pos 1).
2. CRIMP: C at pos 1, P at pos 5 – fits (P is at pos 5, not 1; C is at pos 1, not 4).
   - C is allowed at pos 1 (no restriction).
   - P is allowed at pos 5 (no restriction).
   - Letters: C, R, I, M, P – all valid.

Check for other options:
- GRIME: G at 1, but E is eliminated.
- BRINY: B, R, I, N, Y – but where would P and C fit? No, this doesn’t include P or C.
- PRIMY: P at pos 1 again, invalid.

Thus, ""CRIMP"" is the best candidate as it includes both P and C, and fits all constraints.
