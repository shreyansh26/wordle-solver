For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to contain common letters in the English language. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains four very common vowels (A, O, E) and a common consonant (S). However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - hitting several high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter overall
This combination gives good coverage of frequently used letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R, A, N are in the word but in wrong positions.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the form: C _ _ _ _
and must contain R, A, N somewhere after the first letter, each in a different place from their original spots. Also cannot have E.

We can now look for 5-letter words that start with C and include R, A, N in the remaining four positions. 

Possible arrangements:
- C R _ _ _ (move R to 2nd, but original R was 2nd and marked -, so R can't be 2nd)
Wait no, R was 2nd in CRANE and marked -, meaning it's in the word but not 2nd spot.
Similarly A was 3rd and marked -, so A can't be 3rd.
N was 4th and marked -, so N can't be 4th.

So we need:
C _ _ _ _
with R, A, N appearing in positions 2,3,4,5 but not in their original positions (R≠2, A≠3, N≠4), and no E anywhere.

Possible words:
- CRANE is invalid (already used and has E)
- CRA_N: but N can't be 4th
- C_R_A_N: like C R A N _ but A would be 3rd which is invalid
- C A N _ R: like CANER but has E
- C A _ N R: but R would be 5th which is okay, A is 2nd (not 3rd), N is 4th - but N can't be 4th
- C _ R A N: R is 3rd (not 2nd), A is 4th (not 3rd), N is 5th (not 4th) - this works
Looking for C _ R A N words: ""CRAN"" is prefix, but need 5-letter. ""CRANK"" has K not in our letters yet, but possible.

Wait, let's think systematically. We need to place R, A, N in positions 2-5 with restrictions:
R≠2, A≠3, N≠4
Possible permutations of R,A,N in 4 spots (positions 2-5) with these restrictions.

One valid placement is:
C _ R A N
This has:
R in 3 (not 2) ✔
A in 4 (not 3) ✔
N in 5 (not 4) ✔
And no E.

""CRAN_"" - ""CRANK"" is valid, contains K which is new but acceptable since we're testing new letters.

Another option: C A R N _ - but A would be 2nd (ok), R 3rd (ok), N 4th (invalid - was 4th in CRANE)
C N A R _ - N 2nd (ok), A 3rd (invalid - was 3rd in CRANE)
C N _ A R - N 2nd (ok), A 4th (ok), R 5th (ok)
Possible word: CN?AR - ""CIGAR"" but lacks N. ""CYNAR"" is obscure. ""CLNAR"" invalid.

""CRANK"" seems best among these.

Alternatively, could try ""CRONY"" but has E? No, but lacks A. Not good.

Another approach: Since we know C is first and need R,A,N in other positions, another possible word is ""CRAWN"" but R is 2nd which is invalid.

Let me think of common words starting with C containing R,A,N:
- CRANE (used)
- CRANK (valid placement)
- CRAWN (invalid R position)
- CN?AR - nothing common
- CR?AN - CRANE used, CRANK is option

""CRANK"" seems the most reasonable next guess given the constraints.

Let's update what we now know.

1. C is fixed in position 1 (✓ both times).
2. R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because it was “-” both times it appeared in position 2).
3. A is in the word but **not** in position 3.
4. N is in the word but **not** in position 4.
5. E and K are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _

with R, A, N appearing somewhere in positions 2-5 but never in the spots they were tried:
- R ≠ 2
- A ≠ 3
- N ≠ 4

Also, we can rule out letters already used in positions that didn’t match: E, K, and so far C in 1st is the only certainty.

We need a common 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Contains R, A, N (each exactly once)
- Does NOT contain E or K
- Places each of R, A, N in valid positions

Let’s find permutations of R, A, N for positions 2-5 that satisfy the restrictions.

Valid placements of R, A, N (order matters, no repeats):

- R cannot be 2
- A cannot be 3
- N cannot be 4

We have 4 slots after C. We must place R, A, N in 3 of these 4 slots, leaving one slot for another letter (from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding E, K).

Let’s list every permutation of R,A,N in positions 2-5 and check constraints:

1. R A N _ - R is 2 (invalid)
2. R A _ N - R is 2 (invalid)
3. R N A _ - R is 2 (invalid)
4. R N _ A - R is 2 (invalid)
5. R _ A N - R is 2 (invalid)
6. R _ N A - R is 2 (invalid)

7. A R N _ - A is 2 (ok), R is 3 (ok), N is 4 (invalid)
8. A R _ N - A is 2, R is 3, N is 5 (ok) → possible word: C A R _ N → CAR?N
   Need a letter not yet used: C A R ? N → CARON, CARIN, CAR?N
   CARON is a name, CARIN is a name; CARON is acceptable as a word.
   Let’s check: CARON
   - C ✓, A in 2 (ok, wasn’t 3), R in 3 (ok, wasn’t 2), O in 4 (new), N in 5 (ok, wasn’t 4)
   And no E or K.
   This seems valid.

9. A N R _ - A is 2, N is 3, R is 4 (ok), but need to fill last slot. Not obvious common word.
10. A N _ R - A is 2, N is 3, R is 5 (ok) → CAN?R → CANAR, CANER (invalid E), nothing common.
11. A _ R N - A is 2, R is 3, N is 5 (ok) → CA?RN → CABRN invalid, CAIRN (but A is 2 ok, I new, R 3 ok, N 4 ok? Wait N must be 5 here: CAIRN has N in 5, ok. CAIRN is valid.
12. A _ N R - A is 2, N is 3, R is 5 → CA?NR → CABNR invalid, nothing common.

13. N A R _ - N is 2 (ok), A is 3 (invalid)
14. N A _ R - N is 2, A is 3 (invalid)
15. N R A _ - N is 2 (ok), R is 3 (ok), A is 4 (ok) → CNR?A → CNRA? no
16. N R _ A - N is 2, R is 3, A is 5 (ok) → CNR?A → CNRA? no
17. N _ A R - N is 2, A is 3 (invalid)
18. N _ R A - N is 2, R is 3 (ok), A is 4 (ok) → CN?RA → CNTRA invalid, nothing common.

19. _ R A N - first slot after C is 2, so:
   - C _ R A N → CR?AN, but we already tried CRANK (invalid K)
   - So C?RAN → but C is fixed first, so C ? R A N → needs 5 letters. CRAN? CRANE used, CRANK used. No common.

20. _ R N A - C ? R N A → CR?NA → CRINA, CRONA, etc. Not common.

21. _ A R N - C ? A R N → C?ARN → CARN? but need 5 letters: C O A R N invalid, C A A R N invalid, C A R N _ used.

22. _ A N R - C ? A N R → C?ANR → CANAR, CANOR invalid.

23. _ N A R - C ? N A R → C?NAR → CINAR, CONAR invalid.

24. _ N R A - C ? N R A → C?NRA → CNTRA invalid.

Thus the only common, valid words seem:
- CARON (from 8)
- CAIRN (from 11)

Both satisfy:
- Start with C
- Contain R, A, N once each
- R, A, N not in invalid positions
- No E or K

Between them, CAIRN is a more widely recognized English word (a pile of stones as a landmark).

Let’s go with CAIRN.

</think>

<guess>CAIRN</guess>",CAIRN,"Let's update what we now know.

1. C is fixed in position 1 (✓ both times).
2. R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because it was “-” both times it appeared in position 2).
3. A is in the word but **not** in position 3.
4. N is in the word but **not** in position 4.
5. E and K are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _

with R, A, N appearing somewhere in positions 2-5 but never in the spots they were tried:
- R ≠ 2
- A ≠ 3
- N ≠ 4

Also, we can rule out letters already used in positions that didn’t match: E, K, and so far C in 1st is the only certainty.

We need a common 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Contains R, A, N (each exactly once)
- Does NOT contain E or K
- Places each of R, A, N in valid positions

Let’s find permutations of R, A, N for positions 2-5 that satisfy the restrictions.

Valid placements of R, A, N (order matters, no repeats):

- R cannot be 2
- A cannot be 3
- N cannot be 4

We have 4 slots after C. We must place R, A, N in 3 of these 4 slots, leaving one slot for another letter (from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding E, K).

Let’s list every permutation of R,A,N in positions 2-5 and check constraints:

1. R A N _ - R is 2 (invalid)
2. R A _ N - R is 2 (invalid)
3. R N A _ - R is 2 (invalid)
4. R N _ A - R is 2 (invalid)
5. R _ A N - R is 2 (invalid)
6. R _ N A - R is 2 (invalid)

7. A R N _ - A is 2 (ok), R is 3 (ok), N is 4 (invalid)
8. A R _ N - A is 2, R is 3, N is 5 (ok) → possible word: C A R _ N → CAR?N
   Need a letter not yet used: C A R ? N → CARON, CARIN, CAR?N
   CARON is a name, CARIN is a name; CARON is acceptable as a word.
   Let’s check: CARON
   - C ✓, A in 2 (ok, wasn’t 3), R in 3 (ok, wasn’t 2), O in 4 (new), N in 5 (ok, wasn’t 4)
   And no E or K.
   This seems valid.

9. A N R _ - A is 2, N is 3, R is 4 (ok), but need to fill last slot. Not obvious common word.
10. A N _ R - A is 2, N is 3, R is 5 (ok) → CAN?R → CANAR, CANER (invalid E), nothing common.
11. A _ R N - A is 2, R is 3, N is 5 (ok) → CA?RN → CABRN invalid, CAIRN (but A is 2 ok, I new, R 3 ok, N 4 ok? Wait N must be 5 here: CAIRN has N in 5, ok. CAIRN is valid.
12. A _ N R - A is 2, N is 3, R is 5 → CA?NR → CABNR invalid, nothing common.

13. N A R _ - N is 2 (ok), A is 3 (invalid)
14. N A _ R - N is 2, A is 3 (invalid)
15. N R A _ - N is 2 (ok), R is 3 (ok), A is 4 (ok) → CNR?A → CNRA? no
16. N R _ A - N is 2, R is 3, A is 5 (ok) → CNR?A → CNRA? no
17. N _ A R - N is 2, A is 3 (invalid)
18. N _ R A - N is 2, R is 3 (ok), A is 4 (ok) → CN?RA → CNTRA invalid, nothing common.

19. _ R A N - first slot after C is 2, so:
   - C _ R A N → CR?AN, but we already tried CRANK (invalid K)
   - So C?RAN → but C is fixed first, so C ? R A N → needs 5 letters. CRAN? CRANE used, CRANK used. No common.

20. _ R N A - C ? R N A → CR?NA → CRINA, CRONA, etc. Not common.

21. _ A R N - C ? A R N → C?ARN → CARN? but need 5 letters: C O A R N invalid, C A A R N invalid, C A R N _ used.

22. _ A N R - C ? A N R → C?ANR → CANAR, CANOR invalid.

23. _ N A R - C ? N A R → C?NAR → CINAR, CONAR invalid.

24. _ N R A - C ? N R A → C?NRA → CNTRA invalid.

Thus the only common, valid words seem:
- CARON (from 8)
- CAIRN (from 11)

Both satisfy:
- Start with C
- Contain R, A, N once each
- R, A, N not in invalid positions
- No E or K

Between them, CAIRN is a more widely recognized English word (a pile of stones as a landmark).

Let’s go with CAIRN.",Guess 3: CAIRN -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
