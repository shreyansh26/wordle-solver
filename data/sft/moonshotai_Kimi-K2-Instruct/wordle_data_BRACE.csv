For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that appears in many potential answers. This helps maximize the information gained. A commonly recommended opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very frequent letters: A, R, O, S, E. These letters are all vowels or high-frequency consonants, giving us good coverage for elimination or confirmation in the secret word.

Another strong choice is ""SLATE"" - but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opening that tests multiple vowels and the common consonant S.

From the feedback:

- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R(✓): R is in the word AND correctly placed in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word AND correctly placed in position 5.

So we have:
- Known pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters excluded: O, S  
- Additional letters that must appear (from A(-)): A is somewhere in positions 2–5 (but 2 is already R, 5 is E), so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- No repeated letters indicated so far.

Good next guesses should:
1. Fix R in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Place A in position 3 or 4.
3. Avoid O and S.
4. Use new common consonants (like T, N, D, L, C, etc.) to test more positions.

Possible candidates:
- CRATE (but S is excluded, T is good)
- GRATE (G is less common, but possible)
- BRAVE (but V is less common)
- CRANE (C, N are good consonants; A in position 3, N in 4)
- DRAIN (but I is untested)

I’ll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3 (consistent with feedback).
- Uses new common consonants C and N in positions 1 and 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This helps maximize the information gained. A commonly recommended opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very frequent letters: A, R, O, S, E. These letters are all vowels or high-frequency consonants, giving us good coverage for elimination or confirmation in the secret word.

Another strong choice is ""SLATE"" - but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic opening that tests multiple vowels and the common consonant S.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R(✓): R is in the word AND correctly placed in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word AND correctly placed in position 5.

So we have:
- Known pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters excluded: O, S  
- Additional letters that must appear (from A(-)): A is somewhere in positions 2–5 (but 2 is already R, 5 is E), so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- No repeated letters indicated so far.

Good next guesses should:
1. Fix R in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Place A in position 3 or 4.
3. Avoid O and S.
4. Use new common consonants (like T, N, D, L, C, etc.) to test more positions.

Possible candidates:
- CRATE (but S is excluded, T is good)
- GRATE (G is less common, but possible)
- BRAVE (but V is less common)
- CRANE (C, N are good consonants; A in position 3, N in 4)
- DRAIN (but I is untested)

I’ll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3 (consistent with feedback).
- Uses new common consonants C and N in positions 1 and 4.
- Keeps R and E fixed.
- Avoids O and S.

I’ll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3 (consistent with feedback).
- Uses new common consonants C and N in positions 1 and 4.
- Keeps R and E fixed.
- Avoids O and S.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E  (positions 2-3-5 locked in)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, A, E (and from A(-) in guess 1, A was already confirmed elsewhere)
- Letters excluded so far: O, S, C, N
- Still unused common consonants: T, L, D, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- We need to place another consonant in positions 1 and 4 (but 4 is already E, no wait – positions are 1 and 4. Actually, the pattern is:
  - Position 1: ?
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: A
  - Position 4: ?
  - Position 5: E

So we're looking for words fitting: ? R A ? E

Common words fitting this pattern:
- BRAVE (B, V – but V is less common)
- CRATE (but C is out)
- GRATE (G is possible)
- FRATE (not a word)
- PRATE (P is possible)
- DRATE (not a word)
- BRACE (but C is out)
- BRANE (N is out)
- TRACE (C is out)
- GRADE (but we need to end with E)
- GRAVE (V possible but less common)

Best candidates among these:
- GRATE: G R A T E
- BRATE: B R A T E
- PRATE: P R A T E

""GRATE"" seems most likely as G and T are both reasonably common.

Letters confirmed present: R, A, E  
Letters confirmed absent: O, S, C, N, G, T  

We need a consonant for position 1 and another consonant for position 4.
Remaining common consonants not yet excluded: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Possible consonant pairs for positions 1 and 4 (avoiding exclusions):
- B and D: BRADE (not a standard word)
- B and L: BRA LE (need 5 letters)
- B and M: BRAME (not a word)
- D and B: DRABE (not a word)

- DRAKE

Both are valid 5-letter words. Between them, B and D are both common. I'll choose BRAKE.

Common 5-letter words of the form “BRA _ E”:

- BRAKE – already tried, K rejected  
- BRACE – C rejected  
- BRAVE – V still possible  
- BRAZE – Z uncommon, but possible  
- BRADE – uncommon spelling of “braid”  
- BRAHE – proper noun (Tycho Brahe), not usually accepted  
- BRAME – not a standard word  

Among the remaining standard words, the most common is “BRAVE.”  
Test it.

(If it’s wrong, the only other likely candidate left is BRAZE, but BRAVE is more common.)
