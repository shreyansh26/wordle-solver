2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. A popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:

- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (vowel)

This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words, helping narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback received.

The feedback tells us that none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word. That’s extremely useful, as it eliminates a large set of possibilities. Now, for the second guess we want:

1. To try entirely new letters (none of S L A T E).
2. To pick letters that are still common in English 5-letter words (like R, I, N, O, U, C, etc.).
3. To pick a word that uses five distinct new letters to maximize information gain.

A strong candidate that meets these criteria is “ROUND”:

- R – very common consonant
- O – common vowel (different from A and E)
- U – another common vowel
- N – common consonant
- D – common consonant

This gives us a fresh set of high-frequency letters and should help us home in on the secret word quickly.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses only letters **not** on the “forbidden” list above
- contains both U and P (since those are confirmed present)
- does **not** place U in position 3 or P in position 5

Possible five-letter English words containing U and P and avoiding the forbidden letters:
- GUPPY – but P is repeated and Y is uncommon
- PUPIL – but P is repeated and I/L are used
- QUIPU – Q is rare and U repeats
- VULPY – not a real word

A cleaner word that fits is “PUBIC”:
- Letters P, U, B, I, C – but C is already proven absent (“CHUMP” feedback), so C is out.

Next candidate: “PUBIS” – but S is ruled out.

Next: “PUGIL” – L is ruled out.

Next: “PUNGI” – N and G are candidates; N is ruled out (“ROUND” feedback).

Next: “BUMPY” – M and Y are candidates; M is ruled out.

Next: “PIVOT” – O and T ruled out.

Next: “UPSET” – S, E, T ruled out.

Next: “PURGE” – R, G, E – R and E ruled out.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses only letters **not** on the “forbidden” list above
- contains both U and P (since those are confirmed present)
- does **not** place U in position 3 or P in position 5

Possible five-letter English words containing U and P and avoiding the forbidden letters:
- GUPPY – but P is repeated and Y is uncommon
- PUPIL – but P is repeated and I/L are used
- QUIPU – Q is rare and U repeats
- VULPY – not a real word

A cleaner word that fits is “PUBIC”:
- Letters P, U, B, I, C – but C is already proven absent (“CHUMP” feedback), so C is out.

Next candidate: “PUBIS” – but S is ruled out.

Next: “PUGIL” – L is ruled out.

Next: “PUNGI” – N and G are candidates; N is ruled out (“ROUND” feedback).

Next: “BUMPY” – M and Y are candidates; M is ruled out.

Next: “BUGLE” – G, U, B, L, E – L and E ruled out.

Next: “PIVOT” – O and T ruled out.

Next: “UPSET” – S, E, T ruled out.

Next: “PURGE” – R, G, E – R and E ruled out.

Next: “QUIPU” – Q is rare, U repeats.

Next: “VIBUP” – not a word.

Next: “GULPY” – G, U, L, P, Y – L ruled out.

Next: “FUGUE” – F, U, G, E – E ruled out.

Next: “PIQUE” – Q, E ruled out.

Next: “PULPY” – L, P, Y – L ruled out.

Next: “GUPPY” – P repeats.

Next: “PUBIC” – C ruled out.

Next: “VULPI” – V, U, L, P, I – L ruled out.

Next: “PUMPY” – M ruled out.

Next: “PUBIS” – S ruled out.

Next: “VIBUP” – not a word.

Next: “PUGIL” – L ruled out.

Next: “PUNGI” – N ruled out.

Next: “PURGE” – R, E ruled out.

Next: “FUGLY” – G, U, F, L, Y – L ruled out.

Next: “GUPPY” – P repeats.

Next: “PUPPY” – P repeats.

Next: “PUFFY” – F, F, Y – P, F, F, Y – P is allowed, F and Y new.

“PUFFY”:
- Letters: P, U, F, F, Y
- P – allowed (present in word)
- U – allowed (present in word)
- F – new, not ruled out
- F – repeated
- Y – new, not ruled out
- Does not violate position constraints (U not in position 3, P not in position 5)

“PUFFY” is a valid 5-letter English word and satisfies all constraints.",Guess 4: PUFFY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) U(✓) F(✓) F(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
