For the first guess, we want to use a word that covers common letters and is a good starting point to gather information. There are several strategies, but a popular one is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Good first choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Among these, ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel (along with A)

This gives a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting hits early.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, S are NOT in the word (x).
- I and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
1. Contains the letters I and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain R, A, or S.

Next, we need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses I and E in different positions than 3 and 5.
- Avoids R, A, S.

I need a word that includes I and E, and preferably other common consonants. Since we don’t know positions yet, let’s try shifting I and E to other spots.

Possible new word: ""TIDEL"" – but L is in position 4, and E is still in position 5 (same as before), which is blocked. Not good.

Another word: ""ELITE"" – E is in position 1 (new), L, I in position 2 (new), T in position 4 (new), E in position 5 (blocked). So E is in 5 again – no.

Another: ""PIECE"" – C and P are new consonants, I is in 2, E in 3 and 5. E in 5 is blocked, so no.

Another: ""WIELD"" – W, L, D are new consonants, I in 2, E in 4. Both I and E are in new positions (2 and 4). No R, A, or S. This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- WIELD: W, I, E, L, D
- I is in 2 (not 3) – ok
- E is in 4 (not 5) – ok
- No R, A, S – ok

So far:
- Letters not in the word: R, A, S, L
- Letters known to be in the word: W (correct position 1), I (correct position 2), E (somewhere, but not position 4), D (somewhere, but not position 5)

Current pattern: W I _ _ _  
Third letter can be anything except R, A, S, L  
Fourth letter can be anything except R, A, S, L (and not E)  
Fifth letter can be anything except R, A, S, L, D (and not E)

We still need to place E and D somewhere inside.  
E is known to be in the word but not in position 4.  
D is known to be in the word but not in position 5.

So E can be in position 3 or 5.  
D can be in positions 3 or 4.

Let’s try:
E in position 3 and D in position 4:  
letters: W I E D ?  
The last letter must not be in R, A, S, L, D.  
Let’s check common consonants: W I E D N → W I E D N → ""W I E D N"" isn't a valid word.  
""W I N E D"" – D must be in 3 or 4, so 4 is ok, but then E is in 3. This gives W I N E D. That’s not right.

Wait, let's try placing E in position 5 and D in position 3 or 4.  
E in position 5: W I _ _ E  
Then D must be in 3 or 4.  
Let’s try W I D E ? – but E is at 5, so W I D E is only 4 letters.  
Let’s try W I D G E – W I D G E. This is valid. Check letters: W ✓, I ✓, D, G, E. We know W and I are correct positions, E is in the word but not in 4, so 5 is ok. D is in 3, which is allowed. G is new. No R, A, S, L. This fits.

So ""WIDGE"" – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try another: W I D E N – WIDEN. That is a valid word.  
Check: W I D E N  
- W is in position 1 ✓  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- D in position 3 (allowed, since D is somewhere but not position 5)

No R, A, S, L. This fits all constraints.
