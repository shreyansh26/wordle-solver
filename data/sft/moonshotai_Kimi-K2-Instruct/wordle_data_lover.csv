For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Has a good balance of vowels and consonants

Popular starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" - uses common letters S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""ADIEU"" - uses many vowels
- ""RAISE"" - uses common letters

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word has L and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
2. The word has no S, A, or T.

We need a word that:
- Contains L and E
- Does NOT contain S, A, or T
- Has 5 letters

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, Z
Common vowels still available: E (already known to be present), I, O, U

Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, and L is in the word but not in the 2nd position, a good next guess would be a word like:
- OLDER (but has D which is okay, but L is 2nd position - that's the position it can't be)
- LEMON (but has M which is okay, E is 2nd - okay, L is 1st - okay)
- ELBOW (but has W which is okay, B is okay)
- RELIC (but C is okay, I is okay)

Looking at these, ""ELBOW"" seems good because it has:
- E in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- L in position 2 (but feedback says L is in wrong position in SLATE, where it was position 2 - so this might not be ideal)
Wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got ""-"", so L is NOT in position 2.

Alternative: ""ROBLE"" - but that's 5 letters, has L and E, and no S/A/T
But ""ROBLE"" is less common.

""LEMON"" - L is position 1 (okay, since in SLATE it was position 2), E is position 2 (okay), M,O,N are all new letters.

""CRUEL"" - has C,R,U,E,L - no S/A/T, E is position 4 (new), L is position 5 (but E was in 5 and got ""-"", so 5 could be L - but E was wrong in 5, not necessarily L)

Actually, let's think more systematically:
We know letters: L and E exist, positions unknown except L≠2, E≠5
Letters to exclude: S, A, T
Need 5-letter word with L and E, no S,A,T, and positions respect constraints.

Possible good choices: ""ELBOW"" (but L is position 2, which was the position it was wrong in SLATE - so no)
""PLUMB"" - has L, no E
""WORLD"" - no E
""FLEER"" - but has double E, and F,E,R are new, but double E is a bit specific

""CRUEL"" looks good:
- C, R, U, E, L
- No S, A, T
- E is position 4 (not 5 - okay)
- L is position 5 (not 2 - okay)
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must contain L and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively), and cannot contain S, A, or T. A good next guess that fits these constraints is ""CRUEL"".

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,lover,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Has a good balance of vowels and consonants

Popular starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" - uses common letters S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""ADIEU"" - uses many vowels
- ""RAISE"" - uses common letters

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word has L and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
2. The word has no S, A, or T.

We need a word that:
- Contains L and E
- Does NOT contain S, A, or T
- Has 5 letters

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, Z
Common vowels still available: E (already known to be present), I, O, U

Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, and L is in the word but not in the 2nd position, a good next guess would be a word like:
- OLDER (but has D which is okay, but L is 2nd position - that's the position it can't be)
- LEMON (but has M which is okay, E is 2nd - okay, L is 1st - okay)
- ELBOW (but has W which is okay, B is okay)
- RELIC (but C is okay, I is okay)

Looking at these, ""ELBOW"" seems good because it has:
- E in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- L in position 2 (but feedback says L is in wrong position in SLATE, where it was position 2 - so this might not be ideal)
Wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got ""-"", so L is NOT in position 2.

Alternative: ""ROBLE"" - but that's 5 letters, has L and E, and no S/A/T
But ""ROBLE"" is less common.

""LEMON"" - L is position 1 (okay, since in SLATE it was position 2), E is position 2 (okay), M,O,N are all new letters.

""CRUEL"" - has C,R,U,E,L - no S/A/T, E is position 4 (new), L is position 5 (but E was in 5 and got ""-"", so 5 could be L - but E was wrong in 5, not necessarily L)

Actually, let's think more systematically:
We know letters: L and E exist, positions unknown except L≠2, E≠5
Letters to exclude: S, A, T
Need 5-letter word with L and E, no S,A,T, and positions respect constraints.

Possible good choices: ""ELBOW"" (but L is position 2, which was the position it was wrong in SLATE - so no)
""PLUMB"" - has L, no E
""WORLD"" - no E
""FLEER"" - but has double E, and F,E,R are new, but double E is a bit specific

""CRUEL"" looks good:
- C, R, U, E, L
- No S, A, T
- E is position 4 (not 5 - okay)
- L is position 5 (not 2 - okay)Based on the feedback, the word must contain L and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively), and cannot contain S, A, or T. A good next guess that fits these constraints is ""CRUEL"".

2. Letters NOT in the word:

3. Letter positions we know:
   - E is in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback E(✓) in 4th spot)
   - L is not in position 2 (from SLATE feedback)
   - R is somewhere but not in position 2 (from CRUEL feedback)

4. Letters still possible:
   B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4
- Contains L and R somewhere (but L ≠ 2, R ≠ 2)
- Uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated
- Uses fresh consonants where possible

Good options to test:
- OLDER – but D is okay, O is okay, L would be 3 (allowed), E is 4 (correct), R is 5 (allowed)
- BLOWN – but B, L, O, W, N are all unused; L in position 3 (okay), E is missing (can’t be)
- WORLD – but D is okay, W/O/R/L are okay; R in position 2 (forbidden, CRUEL showed R(-) so R ≠ 2)

The best seems “OLDER”:
- Letters: O, L, D, E, R
- E is fixed in position 4 ✓
- L and R are both present and placed in new positions (L in 3, R in 5) that were not ruled out
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, C, U)
- Tests new letters O and D

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses:

Letters known to be in the word  
- E is in position 4. (✓ in OLDER position 4)  
- R is in position 5. (✓ in OLDER position 5)  

Letters still in the word but whose positions are unknown  
- L and O both showed “-” in OLDER:  
  – L was in position 3 in OLDER → L ≠ 3  
  – O was in position 1 in OLDER → O ≠ 1  
  – Additionally, from SLATE, L ≠ 2.  
  – Therefore L can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But 4 is E and 5 is R, so L must be in position 1.  
- O also showed “-” in OLDER (position 1) → O ≠ 1. O could be in positions 2 or 3 (4 and 5 are taken by E and R).

Letters definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, T, C, U, D (from the x’s so far).

So the pattern so far is:
1: L  
2: ? (must be O or another unused letter)  
3: ? (must be O or another unused letter, but O can’t be in both 2 and 3)  
4: E  
5: R

Unused letters that are still available: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Since O must appear somewhere (because it got “-”), and the only remaining slots are 2 and 3, we have two basic skeletons:
- L O _ E R   (O in position 2)  
- L _ O E R   (O in position 3)

We need one more consonant for the blank. Good, common unused consonants are B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc. Let’s pick a simple consonant for the blank that makes a valid word.

Candidate:  
- LOWER → L O W E R (W is unused, word is valid)

LOWER fits every constraint:
- L in position 1 (allowed)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- W unused so far  
- E in position 4 (correct)

So the pattern so far is:
1: L  
2: ? (must be O or another unused letter)  
3: ? (must be O or another unused letter, but O can’t be in both 2 and 3)  
4: E  
5: R

Unused letters that are still available: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Since O must appear somewhere (because it got “-”), and the only remaining slots are 2 and 3, we have two basic skeletons:
- L O _ E R   (O in position 2)  
- L _ O E R   (O in position 3)

We need one more consonant for the blank. Good, common unused consonants are B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc. Let’s pick a simple consonant for the blank that makes a valid word.

Candidate:  
- LOWER → L O W E R (W is unused, word is valid)

LOWER fits every constraint:
- L in position 1 (allowed)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- W unused so far  
- E in position 4 (correct)  
- R in position 5 (correct)  
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, C, U, D) appear.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Has a good balance of vowels and consonants

Popular starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" - uses common letters S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""ADIEU"" - uses many vowels
- ""RAISE"" - uses common letters

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word has L and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
2. The word has no S, A, or T.

We need a word that:
- Contains L and E
- Does NOT contain S, A, or T
- Has 5 letters

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, Z
Common vowels still available: E (already known to be present), I, O, U

Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, and L is in the word but not in the 2nd position, a good next guess would be a word like:
- OLDER (but has D which is okay, but L is 2nd position - that's the position it can't be)
- LEMON (but has M which is okay, E is 2nd - okay, L is 1st - okay)
- ELBOW (but has W which is okay, B is okay)
- RELIC (but C is okay, I is okay)

Looking at these, ""ELBOW"" seems good because it has:
- E in position 1 (new position, not 5)
- L in position 2 (but feedback says L is in wrong position in SLATE, where it was position 2 - so this might not be ideal)
Wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got ""-"", so L is NOT in position 2.

Alternative: ""ROBLE"" - but that's 5 letters, has L and E, and no S/A/T
But ""ROBLE"" is less common.

""LEMON"" - L is position 1 (okay, since in SLATE it was position 2), E is position 2 (okay), M,O,N are all new letters.

""CRUEL"" - has C,R,U,E,L - no S/A/T, E is position 4 (new), L is position 5 (but E was in 5 and got ""-"", so 5 could be L - but E was wrong in 5, not necessarily L)

Actually, let's think more systematically:
We know letters: L and E exist, positions unknown except L≠2, E≠5
Letters to exclude: S, A, T
Need 5-letter word with L and E, no S,A,T, and positions respect constraints.

Possible good choices: ""ELBOW"" (but L is position 2, which was the position it was wrong in SLATE - so no)
""PLUMB"" - has L, no E
""WORLD"" - no E
""FLEER"" - but has double E, and F,E,R are new, but double E is a bit specific

""CRUEL"" looks good:
- C, R, U, E, L
- No S, A, T
- E is position 4 (not 5 - okay)
- L is position 5 (not 2 - okay)Based on the feedback, the word must contain L and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively), and cannot contain S, A, or T. A good next guess that fits these constraints is ""CRUEL"".

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters in the word (exact positions unknown yet):
   - E, L, R  
   (from CRUEL: E(✓) in position 4, R(-) and L(-) somewhere in the word)

2. Letters NOT in the word:
   - S, A, T, C, U

3. Letter positions we know:
   - E is in position 4 (from CRUEL feedback E(✓) in 4th spot)
   - L is not in position 2 (from SLATE feedback)
   - R is somewhere but not in position 2 (from CRUEL feedback)

4. Letters still possible:
   B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4
- Contains L and R somewhere (but L ≠ 2, R ≠ 2)
- Uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated
- Uses fresh consonants where possible

Good options to test:
- OLDER – but D is okay, O is okay, L would be 3 (allowed), E is 4 (correct), R is 5 (allowed)
- BLOWN – but B, L, O, W, N are all unused; L in position 3 (okay), E is missing (can’t be)
- WORLD – but D is okay, W/O/R/L are okay; R in position 2 (forbidden, CRUEL showed R(-) so R ≠ 2)

The best seems “OLDER”:
- Letters: O, L, D, E, R
- E is fixed in position 4 ✓
- L and R are both present and placed in new positions (L in 3, R in 5) that were not ruled out
- No forbidden letters (S, A, T, C, U)
- Tests new letters O and D

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses:

Letters known to be in the word  
- E is in position 4. (✓ in OLDER position 4)  
- R is in position 5. (✓ in OLDER position 5)  

Letters still in the word but whose positions are unknown  
- L and O both showed “-” in OLDER:  
  – L was in position 3 in OLDER → L ≠ 3  
  – O was in position 1 in OLDER → O ≠ 1  
  – Additionally, from SLATE, L ≠ 2.  
  – Therefore L can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But 4 is E and 5 is R, so L must be in position 1.  
- O also showed “-” in OLDER (position 1) → O ≠ 1. O could be in positions 2 or 3 (4 and 5 are taken by E and R).

Letters definitely NOT in the word  
S, A, T, C, U, D (from the x’s so far).

So the pattern so far is:
1: L  
2: ? (must be O or another unused letter)  
3: ? (must be O or another unused letter, but O can’t be in both 2 and 3)  
4: E  
5: R

Unused letters that are still available: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Since O must appear somewhere (because it got “-”), and the only remaining slots are 2 and 3, we have two basic skeletons:
- L O _ E R   (O in position 2)  
- L _ O E R   (O in position 3)

We need one more consonant for the blank. Good, common unused consonants are B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc. Let’s pick a simple consonant for the blank that makes a valid word.

Candidate:  
- LOWER → L O W E R (W is unused, word is valid)

LOWER fits every constraint:
- L in position 1 (allowed)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- W unused so far  
- E in position 4 (correct)  
- R in position 5 (correct)

Real English words that fit L O _ E R:

Since LONER failed and LOVER is the last obvious candidate, we must try it now (we have one guess left).
