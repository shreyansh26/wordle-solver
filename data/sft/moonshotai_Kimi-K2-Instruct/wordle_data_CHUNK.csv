For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common, frequently occurring letters in English to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with five distinct letters, including both vowels and consonants, and avoiding less common letters like Q, X, or Z.

Some strong opening words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A (common vowel)
- N, E (very common letters)
This should give good initial coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the first feedback (CRANE → C✓ R× A× N✓ E×):
- C is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 4.
- R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
C _ _ N _

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 and 5 with letters that haven’t been ruled out (no R, A, E). Also, no repeated letters yet.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, G, B, M, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Keeps C and N fixed.
- Uses new letters for the blanks.
- Uses an O or I or U for a vowel.
- Uses common consonants for the rest.

Candidate words:
- COINS → C O I N S → but E is out, S is in.
- CLOWN → C L O W N → but W isn’t ruled out, L is fine, O is fine.
- COLON → C O L O N → but O repeats.
- CHINO → C H I N O → but H is fine, I and O are fine.

“CHINO”:
- C ✓ (1st)
- H (new)
- I (new vowel)
- N ✓ (4th)
- O (new vowel)

But it has two vowels (I and O) in middle positions. Let’s see if it fits the pattern: C H I N O. All letters are unused except C and N which are confirmed.

“CLINK”:
C L I N K → but K is unused, I is unused, L is unused. K is a good consonant.

Between CHINO and CLINK, CLINK has more distinct consonants and a new vowel (I) but only one vowel. Let’s go with CLINK.

Check: C L I N K → C✓, N✓, L I K are new, not ruled out. Seems good.
