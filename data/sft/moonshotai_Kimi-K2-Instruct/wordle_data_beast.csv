For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage to help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage. However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes even more common letters (S, L, A, T, E) while maintaining good vowel/consonant balance.

The letters in SLATE appear in many words, so this should give us good information about what letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- L is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct third position.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Positions: _ _ A _ _
- Required letters: S, T, E (all in wrong positions in SLATE, so none of them are in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively)
- Forbidden letter: L

Also, since A is fixed in position 3, we need to find a 5-letter word with A in the middle and containing S, T, E elsewhere.

Possible positions for S, T, E:
- Position 1: could be S or T (since E was in position 5 in SLATE and is wrong, E can't be here)
- Position 2: could be any of S, T, E (but E was in position 5, so possible)
- Position 4: could be S, T, or E
- Position 5: could be S or T (E was here and is wrong)

Looking for common 5-letter words with pattern _ _ A _ _ containing S, T, E:
- PASTE: has P,A,S,T,E - but T is in position 4 which matches SLATE's T in position 4 (but feedback said T is in wrong position in SLATE, so T can't be in position 4)
- STARE: S,T,A,R,E - R wasn't tested yet, and positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5)
  - S was in position 1 in SLATE and is wrong, so can't be here
- TASER: T,A,S,E,R - positions: T(1), A(2) but A needs to be in position 3
- CRATE: C,R,A,T,E - but T is in position 4 (same as SLATE)
- FEAST: F,E,A,S,T - positions: F(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)
  - E was in position 5 originally and is wrong, so E in position 2 is okay
  - S was in position 1 originally and is wrong, so S in position 4 is okay
  - T was in position 4 originally and is wrong, so T in position 5 is okay
This seems valid.
