For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategically best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. The word should ideally contain multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). It covers a good range of frequently used letters without repeating any, giving us the best chance to narrow down possible letters early on.

From the first guess SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)

- No S, A, T, E
- The remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

2. Use new common letters (especially vowels since we eliminated A and E)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The word should ideally contain multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it includes three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). It covers a good range of frequently used letters without repeating any, giving us the best chance to narrow down possible letters early on.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A, T, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _L _ _ _ (L is fixed in position 2)
- No S, A, T, E
- The remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good next words should:
1. Keep L in position 2
2. Use new common letters (especially vowels since we eliminated A and E)
3. Avoid S, T, A, E

Possible vowels left: I, O, U, Y
Common consonants left: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _L O _ _ (using O)
- _L I _ _ (using I)
- _L U _ _ (using U)

Good candidate words:
- BLOWN (but W and N are common)
- CLOUD (but D is less common)
- FLING (but G is less common)
- GLOOM (but repeats O)
- PLUMB (but B is less common)

The strongest seems to be BLOWN as it uses common letters B, L, O, W, N and keeps L in position 2.

Remaining common letters:  
Vowels left: I, U, Y  
Consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, X, Z  

Good strategy: pick a word that
1. keeps L in position 2,
2. introduces two new vowels (or Y as vowel) and three new consonants,
3. uses the most common remaining letters.

Candidate patterns:
- _ L I _ _
- _ L U _ _

Possible words:
- CLINK (C, I, N, K) – but N is already ruled out.
- FLICK (F, L, I, C, K) – uses I, C, F, K.
- PLUCK (P, L, U, C, K) – uses U, C, P, K.

Among these, FLICK is attractive because:
– all its letters (F, L, I, C, K) are still allowed,
– it places I in a common spot (3rd),
– it introduces four new consonants (F, C, K) plus the vowel I.
