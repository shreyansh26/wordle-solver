- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate as many possibilities as early as possible. A good opening word typically contains vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are often good choices. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular opening guess because it uses three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This combination helps maximize the information gained about letter positions and presence in the target word.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" which also covers key letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better letter frequency distribution according to word game analysis.

From the two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
- A, R, O are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- S and E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: RATIO → R(✓) A(✓) T(x) I(✓) O(✓)
- R is now in the correct position (position 1).
- A is now in the correct position (position 2).
- O is now in the correct position (position 5).
- T is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: R A _ _ O
- I must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (it can’t be in position 4 from the last feedback, so it must be in position 3).
- The missing letter must be a new consonant (not S, E, T).

Thus the pattern is exactly: R A I _ O

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RAI and ends with O. The only common English word that fits is ""RADIO"". Let’s check:
- R ✓ (position 1)
- A ✓ (position 2)
- I ✓ (position 3)
- D (new letter, not yet tested)
- O ✓ (position 5)
