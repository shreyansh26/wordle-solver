For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word typically has a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possible letters for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere in positions 2–5).  
- R is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.  

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _  
and we know the remaining letters must include A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and cannot be O, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, L, N, C, D, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is known to be present later, and O, E are out).

I want a word that:
- keeps R in position 2,
- places A in positions 3, 4, or 5,
- adds new, common consonants and vowels.

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, N are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- A is tried in position 3, satisfying the “A is in the word but wrong position” clue.

3. I is fixed in position 4.
4. Letters T, N, O, S, E are NOT in the word.
5. We still need a first and fifth letter that haven’t been ruled out.

So the pattern is: _ R A I _

Possible first–letter choices that are common and haven’t been used: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible last–letter choices that are common and haven’t been used: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus we must allow repeats of A, I, R as long as they fit the pattern.

One very common ending is “D” (e.g., BRAID, GRAID), but “GRAID” isn’t a valid word. “BRAID” is valid and uses all the constraints we have. Let’s try BRAID.

- First letter: B (new, not yet ruled out)

- Word pattern: _ R A I _
- Letters NOT in the word at all: B, D, E, N, O, S, T
- Letters definitely in the word: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), I (pos 4)

We need a first and fifth letter that:
1. Are not any of the ruled-out letters.
2. Are not R, A, or I (since they already appear in their correct positions).
3. Must form a valid English 5-letter word with the fixed pattern _ R A I _.

Available unused letters for first or fifth positions:
Common consonants left: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus vowels U and Y (since A, I are used).

Possible candidates matching _ R A I _:
- F (first) → FRAIx … but FRAID rejected (D is out), FRAIM? Not a word.
- C (first) → CRAIx … CRAID (D out), CRAIC (a word, but C at end is allowed)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word typically has a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possible letters for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere in positions 2–5).  
- R is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.  

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _  
and we know the remaining letters must include A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and cannot be O, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, L, N, C, D, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is known to be present later, and O, E are out).

I want a word that:
- keeps R in position 2,
- places A in positions 3, 4, or 5,
- adds new, common consonants and vowels.

A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, N are new consonants.
- I is a new vowel.
- A is tried in position 3, satisfying the “A is in the word but wrong position” clue.

Let’s go with TRAIN.

<guess>TRAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

1. R is fixed in position 2.
2. A is fixed in position 3.
3. I is fixed in position 4.
4. Letters T, N, O, S, E are NOT in the word.
5. We still need a first and fifth letter that haven’t been ruled out.

So the pattern is: _ R A I _

Possible first–letter choices that are common and haven’t been used: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible last–letter choices that are common and haven’t been used: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus we must allow repeats of A, I, R as long as they fit the pattern.

One very common ending is “D” (e.g., BRAID, GRAID), but “GRAID” isn’t a valid word. “BRAID” is valid and uses all the constraints we have. Let’s try BRAID.

Pattern check:
- First letter: B (new, not yet ruled out)
- Second: R (✓ fixed)
- Third: A (✓ fixed)
- Fourth: I (✓ fixed)
- Fifth: D (new, not yet ruled out)

This satisfies everything we know so far.
