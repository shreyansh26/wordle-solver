For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
- No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRATE, TRACE, and ADIEU. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
- The letters S, L, T are completely absent.
- The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain S, L, T.
3. Has A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is “CRANE” because:
- It contains A and E.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- A is in position 3 in CRANE, but we know A is not in position 3. So we must shift A to a different position.

Instead, let’s use “CRANE” but adjust the positions. However, CRANE itself has A in position 3, which contradicts the feedback. Let’s pick another word.

“REACH” is a good candidate:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 3 (which is allowed since we only know E isn’t in position 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

But we can do better—let’s choose “HEARD”:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (not 3).
- E is in position 2 (not 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Tests new consonants H, R, D.

However, HEARD is 5 letters and fits all criteria. Let’s verify:
- H, E, A, R, D – none are S, L, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

This seems good.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, H, R, D  
Letters confirmed to be in the word but with positions still unknown: A, E  
Positions still unknown for A and E, except:
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

So the mystery word contains A and E and is built only from the remaining letters:  
A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a fresh 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the still-allowed letters (no S, L, T, H, R, D).
2. Contains both A and E.
3. Puts A somewhere other than position 3, and E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should also introduce several new consonants to narrow things quickly.  
Looking at the remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Among common 5-letter words, “BEACH” would be ruled out (contains H).  
“PECAN” contains N and C (both new), uses A and E, and satisfies:
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is NOT in position 3.  
So PECAN is invalid.

“PEACE”:
- Letters: P, E, A, C, E  
- Contains A (pos 3) – again invalid.

“CAGE” – too short.

“FAKER” – contains R (ruled out).

“NAIVE” – contains V and N (both new) and I (new vowel), plus A and E.  
Positions: N A I V E  
- A is in position 2 (not 3) ✔  
- E is in position 5 – but feedback says E is NOT in position 5 ✖

- All letters still allowed (no S, L, T, H, R, D).  
- Contains both A and E.  
- Positions: C A N O E

- Positions: O C E A N  
  – A is in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E is in position 3 (allowed, since only restriction was “not in position 5”)

Popular strong starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRATE, TRACE, and ADIEU. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
- The letters S, L, T are completely absent.
- The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain S, L, T.
3. Has A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is “CRANE” because:
- It contains A and E.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- A is in position 3 in CRANE, but we know A is not in position 3. So we must shift A to a different position.

Instead, let’s use “CRANE” but adjust the positions. However, CRANE itself has A in position 3, which contradicts the feedback. Let’s pick another word.

“REACH” is a good candidate:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 3 (which is allowed since we only know E isn’t in position 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

But we can do better—let’s choose “HEARD”:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (not 3).
- E is in position 2 (not 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Tests new consonants H, R, D.

However, HEARD is 5 letters and fits all criteria. Let’s verify:
- H, E, A, R, D – none are S, L, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

This seems good.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, H, R, D  
Letters confirmed to be in the word but with positions still unknown: A, E  
Positions still unknown for A and E, except:
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

So the mystery word contains A and E and is built only from the remaining letters:  
A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a fresh 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the still-allowed letters (no S, L, T, H, R, D).
2. Contains both A and E.
3. Puts A somewhere other than position 3, and E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should also introduce several new consonants to narrow things quickly.  
Looking at the remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Among common 5-letter words, “BEACH” would be ruled out (contains H).  
“PECAN” contains N and C (both new), uses A and E, and satisfies:
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is NOT in position 3.  
So PECAN is invalid.

“PEACE”:
- Letters: P, E, A, C, E  
- Contains A (pos 3) – again invalid.

“CAGE” – too short.

“FAKER” – contains R (ruled out).

“NAIVE” – contains V and N (both new) and I (new vowel), plus A and E.  
Positions: N A I V E  
- A is in position 2 (not 3) ✔  
- E is in position 5 – but feedback says E is NOT in position 5 ✖  

So NAIVE is invalid.

“PANEL” – contains L (ruled out).

“CANOE”:
- Letters: C, A, N, O, E  
- All letters still allowed (no S, L, T, H, R, D).  
- Contains both A and E.  
- Positions: C A N O E  
  – A is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – E is in position 5 (forbidden) ✖

So CANOE is invalid.

“PECAN” again – same issue with A in 3.

“OCEAN”:
- Letters: O, C, E, A, N  
- All letters allowed.  
- Contains A and E.  
- Positions: O C E A N  
  – A is in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E is in position 3 (allowed, since only restriction was “not in position 5”)  
This meets every requirement and introduces three new consonants (O, C, N) plus tests E in position 3 and A in position 4.

Therefore, OCEAN is the best next guess.

  – A in position 2 (allowed)  
  – E in position 5 (forbidden) ✖

“GAMBE” fails.

“JAMBE” – same issue as above.

“PAKEY” – P, A, K, E, Y – allowed letters.
- Positions: P A K E Y  
  – A in 2 (allowed)  
  – E in 4 (allowed)  
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, “PAKEY” is a valid next guess, introducing three new consonants P, K, Y while placing A in position 2 and E in position 4.

Let’s summarize the solid information we now have.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x-feedback so far):
   S, L, T, H, R, D, O, C, N, P, K, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - A  (still floating, not yet locked to a position)
   - E  (now locked to position 4, from Guess 4: E in slot 4 got ✓).

3. Positional constraints:
   - A cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 1).
   - E must be in position 4.

So the word looks like:  _ _ _ E _  with an A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).

Allowed unused letters (have not appeared yet):
B, F, G, I, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E fixed in position 4.
- One A placed in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining three slots filled only from the unused letters above.

Possible patterns:
A _ _ E _
_ A _ E _
_ _ _ E A

Candidate words:
- AMBER  – M and B are still allowed; A is in position 1, E in 4.
- GAMER  – G, M, R; but R is already ruled out.
- FABLE  – B and F allowed; L is ruled out.
- JAMBE  – J, M, B allowed; E in 4, A in 2. (JAMBE is a valid Scrabble word.)
- MAVEN  – V, M, N allowed; but N is ruled out.
- VAGUE  – V, G, U allowed; but U hasn’t been ruled out and we need A in 1, E in 4.

Among these, “AMBER” and “JAMBE” are both valid. “AMBER” uses more common letters and will test three new consonants (A, M, B, E, R) but R is already out. So JAMBE is better because it uses J, M, B, none of which have been tested yet.

J A M B E
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (required)
- J, M, B are new untested consonants.

Hence, JAMBE is the optimal next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
- No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRATE, TRACE, and ADIEU. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters while being a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 respectively.
- The letters S, L, T are completely absent.
- The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain S, L, T.
3. Has A not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is “CRANE” because:
- It contains A and E.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- A is in position 3 in CRANE, but we know A is not in position 3. So we must shift A to a different position.

Instead, let’s use “CRANE” but adjust the positions. However, CRANE itself has A in position 3, which contradicts the feedback. Let’s pick another word.

“REACH” is a good candidate:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 3 (which is allowed since we only know E isn’t in position 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

But we can do better—let’s choose “HEARD”:
- Contains A and E.
- A is in position 4 (not 3).
- E is in position 2 (not 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Tests new consonants H, R, D.

However, HEARD is 5 letters and fits all criteria. Let’s verify:
- H, E, A, R, D – none are S, L, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

This seems good.

Letters confirmed to be in the word but with positions still unknown: A, E  
Positions still unknown for A and E, except:
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

So the mystery word contains A and E and is built only from the remaining letters:  
A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a fresh 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the still-allowed letters (no S, L, T, H, R, D).
2. Contains both A and E.
3. Puts A somewhere other than position 3, and E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess should also introduce several new consonants to narrow things quickly.  
Looking at the remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Among common 5-letter words, “BEACH” would be ruled out (contains H).  
“PECAN” contains N and C (both new), uses A and E, and satisfies:
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is NOT in position 3.  
So PECAN is invalid.

“PEACE”:
- Letters: P, E, A, C, E  
- Contains A (pos 3) – again invalid.

“CAGE” – too short.

“FAKER” – contains R (ruled out).

“NAIVE” – contains V and N (both new) and I (new vowel), plus A and E.  
Positions: N A I V E  
- A is in position 2 (not 3) ✔  
- E is in position 5 – but feedback says E is NOT in position 5 ✖  

So NAIVE is invalid.

“PANEL” – contains L (ruled out).

“CANOE”:
- Letters: C, A, N, O, E  
- All letters still allowed (no S, L, T, H, R, D).  
- Contains both A and E.  
- Positions: C A N O E  
  – A is in position 2 (allowed)  
  – E is in position 5 (forbidden) ✖

So CANOE is invalid.

“PECAN” again – same issue with A in 3.

“OCEAN”:
- Letters: O, C, E, A, N  
- All letters allowed.  
- Contains A and E.  
- Positions: O C E A N  
  – A is in position 4 (allowed)  
  – E is in position 3 (allowed, since only restriction was “not in position 5”)  
This meets every requirement and introduces three new consonants (O, C, N) plus tests E in position 3 and A in position 4.

A good word is “BEAGY” which fits, but “BEAGY” is unusual.  
“GAMBE” isn’t common either.  
“PEAKY” contains P, K, Y, A, E – all allowed, and positions:

Among these, “AMBER” and “JAMBE” are both valid. “AMBER” uses more common letters and will test three new consonants (A, M, B, E, R) but R is already out. So JAMBE is better because it uses J, M, B, none of which have been tested yet.

J A M B E
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (required)
- J, M, B are new untested consonants.

Hence, JAMBE is the optimal next guess.

Let's distill every constraint we now have:

Letters that are definitely OUT:
S, L, T, H, R, D, O, C, N, P, K, Y, J, M, B

Letters that are definitely IN:
- E (locked in position 4, from PAKEY E(✓))
- A (still floating; not in position 3, 2 or 5 from JAMBE feedback shows A(-) in position 2, so A is NOT in 2)

Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5, and E is fixed in position 4.

Unused letters that are still possible (never appeared or been ruled out):
F, G, I, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the word pattern is:
- A _ _ E _  OR  _ _ _ E A
- The blanks must be filled only with letters from F, G, I, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- No repeats allowed.

Possible 5-letter words fitting these rules:
1. A G I V E  (""AGIVE"" – valid, though uncommon)
2. A F I R E – R is out.
3. A U G E – too short.
4. U V E A – too short and letters don’t fit.

- A in position 1 (allowed)
- G, I, V untested consonants
- E in position 4 (required)
