For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants are in the word while potentially getting early position matches.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So:
- Valid letters we now know are in the word: O, E
- Invalid letters (cannot be used again): A, R, S
- Positions to avoid for O: 3
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, S
2. Contains both O and E, placed anywhere except the positions noted above.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is out and we already have O and E).

A balanced choice that tests new common letters while placing O and E in allowed spots is ""TONED"":
- T – new consonant to test
- O – in position 2 (allowed, not 3)
- N – new consonant
- E – in position 4 (allowed, not 5)
- D – new consonant

This adheres to all constraints and gives us more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, T, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): O, E  

Positions still forbidden for each of those two letters:
- O cannot be in position 3 (per AROSE feedback) or position 2 (per TONED feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (per AROSE feedback) or position 4 (per TONED feedback).

So the word must:
1. Contain both O and E, somewhere other than the banned positions above.
2. Use only letters outside the forbidden set {A,R,S,T,N,D}.
3. Try other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining high-frequency consonants: L, C, M, B, F, G, H, Y  
Remaining vowels we’ve not tested: I, U (we already have O and E).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places O somewhere other than positions 2 or 3 (possible: 1, 4, 5)  
- Places E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5 (possible: 1, 2, 3)  
- Adds new common letters to test (e.g., M, I, U, C…).

Candidate: “COBIE”
- C (new consonant)  
- O in position 2 → banned (from TONED), so reject.

Candidate: “MOVIE”
- M (new), O (allowed in position 2? no – banned at 2), so reject.

Candidate: “OCELO” – has repeated O, but 5 unique letters preferred.

Candidate: “LOUIE”
- L (new), O in position 2 → banned. Reject.

Candidate: “HOMIE”
- H (new), O in position 2 → banned. Reject.

Candidate: “ELBOW”
- E in position 1 (allowed)  
- L (new)  
- B (new)  
- O in position 4 (allowed)  
- W (new)  

This satisfies all constraints and introduces four entirely new letters (E,L,B,W) plus confirms O in a legal spot.

So our next guess is “ELBOW”.
