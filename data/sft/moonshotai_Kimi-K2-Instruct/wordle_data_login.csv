Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common English letters to maximize the chance of discovering correct letters
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these high-frequency letters.

Common starter words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me maximum information potential for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains L, but not in position 2.
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses L in a position other than 2 (positions 1,3,4,5).
2. Avoids S, A, T, E entirely
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels

Looking at remaining high-frequency letters: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y

Possible consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Possible vowels: O, I, U, Y

Good candidate words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) - uses L? No, but has common letters. Wait, I need to include L.
- CLONK (C, L, O, N, K) - L is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.
- BLOND (B, L, O, N, D) - L in position 2 again, wrong.
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) - L in position 2, wrong.
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) - L in position 4 (acceptable), and uses O, R, D which are common.

WORLD:
- Contains L in position 4 (not 2, so acceptable)
- Letters W, O, R, L, D - none are S, A, T, E

2. O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at second letter).
3. Forbidden letters so far: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.

We have the pattern:
_ O _ _ _

Remaining possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5.

High-frequency remaining letters (not yet ruled out): N, I, C, U, M, Y, F, G, H, K, B.

I want a word that:
- Places O in position 2.
- Places L somewhere else (1, 3, or 5).
- Uses other high-frequency letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- LONER – R is eliminated, so NO.
- LIONS – S is eliminated, so NO.
- LUMPY – L at 1, M, P, Y – good letters, but P is lower frequency.
- FUNGI – N, F, G, I, U – no L.
- CLOUD – C, L, O, U, D – D is eliminated, so NO.
- BOUND – B, O, U, N, D – D eliminated, so NO.
- FOULS – S eliminated.
- HOLLY – H, O, L, L, Y – L is repeated, but valid 5-letter word. Uses H, L, Y.
- JOLLY – J, O, L, L, Y – J is lower frequency.
- MOLLY – M, O, L, L, Y – M is good, Y is good.

MOLLY:
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- L appears twice (positions 3 and 4), but we only know one L exists. However, it's still possible the word has two L's (like MOLLY itself).
- Letters: M (allowed), O (correct position), L (must appear at least once), L (second L), Y (allowed).
- All letters are from allowed set (none of S,A,T,E,W,R,D).

Another candidate:
LUMBO – L at 1, U, M, B, O – but B is lower frequency.

MOLLY seems better as it maximizes common letters (M, Y) and keeps O in position 2 while placing L in positions 3/4 (both allowed for L).

- In round 3 (MOLLY) L appeared in positions 3 and 4 → both wrong places  
Therefore L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Uses common English letters to maximize the chance of discovering correct letters
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these high-frequency letters.

Common starter words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving me maximum information potential for the first guess.

- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains L, but not in position 2.
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses L in a position other than 2 (positions 1,3,4,5).
2. Avoids S, A, T, E entirely
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels

Looking at remaining high-frequency letters: R, O, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y

Possible consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Possible vowels: O, I, U, Y

Good candidate words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) - uses L? No, but has common letters. Wait, I need to include L.
- CLONK (C, L, O, N, K) - L is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.
- BLOND (B, L, O, N, D) - L in position 2 again, wrong.
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) - L in position 2, wrong.
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) - L in position 4 (acceptable), and uses O, R, D which are common.

WORLD:
- Contains L in position 4 (not 2, so acceptable)
- Letters W, O, R, L, D - none are S, A, T, E
- Uses common letters O, R, L, D

Let’s summarize the hard information we have after four guesses.

1. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _   (O is fixed in position 2).
2. Letter L is in the word but has now been tried in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 and always marked “-” (wrong place).  
   That exhausts every possible position for L, which is impossible — the only explanation is that L appears twice and one of the two copies is still in an untested spot.  
   However, in COBOL we placed L in position 5 and got “-”, so L cannot be in 5.  
   Recap of L placements:
   - SLATE pos 2 → -  
   - WORLD pos 4 → -  
   - MOLLY pos 3 & 4 → both -  
   - COBOL pos 5 → -  

   Every single slot (2,3,4,5) has now been marked “-” for L.  
   This means the word must contain the letter L exactly once and it must be in position **1**, because that is the only place we have never tried it.

Hence the pattern is now: L O _ _ _

Forbidden letters accumulated: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, M, Y, C, B.

Allowed letters (common ones left): N, I, U, F, G, H, K, P, V, J, Q, X, Z (but we’ll stick to high-frequency).

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Starts with LO  
- Contains none of the forbidden letters  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters

Candidate words:
1. LOGIN – G, I, N are allowed.  
2. LOVIN – slang spelling “lovin’”, but not standard.  
3. LOFTY – T is forbidden.  
4. LOOPY – P, Y – Y is forbidden.  
5. LUNGI – N, G, I – U in position 3 is allowed, but “lungi” starts with L U, not L O.

The only clean, common word is LOGIN.

Check its letters:
L (position 1) – never tried here, so possible ✓  
O (position 2) – already ✓  
G, I, N – none are in the forbidden set.
