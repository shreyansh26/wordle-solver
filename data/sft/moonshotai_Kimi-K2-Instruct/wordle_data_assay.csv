For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about what letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at frequency analysis for 5-letter words, some of the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y. 

I want to pick a word that contains several of these common letters. Some good starting options include:
- AROSE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE
- EARTH

Among these, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong choice because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Let's break down the feedback from the first guess:

- A is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the 4th letter in AROSE, so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Contains S (not in 4th position)
- Does not contain R, O, E

Now I need to think of 5-letter words starting with A that contain S but don't have R, O, or E. Possible letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, E).

Since S is somewhere in positions 2-5, let's think of possibilities:
- If S is in position 2: AS___
- If S is in position 3: A_S__
- If S is in position 5: A___S

Looking at common words:
- ASH (but need 5 letters)
- ASKS (need 5 letters)
- ASPIC (too long)
- AMISS (has S in position 4, but that's where it was in AROSE - but feedback said S was wrong position, so 4 is wrong, but 5 could be right)
- AMISS has S in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid for first S)
- ANGST (has S in position 4 - invalid)
- ABYSS (S in position 4 and 5 - position 4 is invalid)
- AGAST (has S in position 4 - invalid)
- ALOES (has O and E - invalid)
- AURAS (has U and A, but A is already used correctly)
- AVAST (has S in position 4 - invalid)
- AWASH (has H and S - S in position 4 invalid)
- AXIOM (no S)
- ABRIS (but R is invalid)

Actually, looking more carefully, we need words starting with A, containing S not in position 4, and no R/O/E.

Possible candidates:
- AMISS (S in position 4 is invalid, but position 5 is valid)
- ABASE (has E - invalid)
- ABUSE (has E - invalid)
- AMISS is A M I S S - but S is in position 4 (invalid) and 5 (valid)
- ANGST (has N, G, T, S - but S is position 4 invalid)
- AXIOM (no S)
- ALIAS (has L, I, A, S - S is position 5 which is valid)

ALIAS fits:
- Starts with A
- Contains S in position 5 (valid)
- Doesn't have R, O, E
- Uses common letters L, I

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is correct in the first position.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5 (it was 4th in AROSE and 5th in ALIAS, both wrong).

Therefore:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere among positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, L, I (because L and I were just shown to be absent).

Permitted letters left (aside from S and the fixed A) are basically anything not yet eliminated. Common choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word starting with A, with S in either position 2 or 3, and using only the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
- A S _ _ _ : ASHY_, ASKS_, etc.  But we need 5 letters.
- A _ S _ _ : AMBUSH is too long; ABBAS (double B, double A) but A is already fixed in 1st and we don’t need another A; ANGST (but G, N, T allowed) – but N, G, T are allowed, and T hasn’t been eliminated.

Wait, ANGST has:
A N G S T – fits:
- A in position 1 ✓
- S in position 4 – but we just learned S cannot be in position 4 or 5, so invalid.

Next possible:
- A B S _ _ : ABSIT (valid word but uncommon)
- A H S _ _ : AHSAN (but has N, A again)
- A D S _ _ : ADSUM (rare)
- A M S _ _ : AMSIN (rare)

Look for more common words:
- A B S E N T – but E is banned.
- A S K _ _ : ASKED has E (banned); ASKER has E/R (banned); ASKEW has E (banned).
- A S P _ _ : ASPIC has I/C (I is banned).
- A S T _ _ : ASTER has E/R (both banned); ASTIR has I/R (banned).
- A S H _ _ : ASHEN has E/N (E banned); ASHES has E/S (E banned).
- A S C _ _ : ASCOT has O/T (O banned).
- A S S _ _ : ASSET has E (banned).
- A T S _ _ : ATSIN (not a word).
- A M U S S – not a word.

Hmm, the only common-ish word left that looks valid is:
A B S U T – no, not a word.

Wait, there’s:
A B U S E – but E banned.

Actually, let’s consider A C S _ _ or A N S _ _ with remaining letters.

Another candidate:
A N S E L – but E, L banned.

A N S A R – not a word.

A N S A S – not a word.

A B S I S – not a word.

Let me step back and list valid English words that:
1. Start with A
2. Have S in position 2 or 3
3. No R, O, E, L, I
4. No A in positions 2–5 (since the last guess ALIAS showed an extra A in position 4 which was marked correct, but that would imply a double A, which we didn’t see any indication of; the feedback simply marked the 4th letter A as ✓. But the secret word might have A in position 1 only. So we should avoid extra A’s unless necessary.)

Wait, the feedback for ALIAS was:
A(✓) L(x) I(x) A(✓) S(-)
This implies:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 4: A ✓
So the secret word is A _ _ A _ and has an S somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Forbidden letters now: R, O, E, L, I
Forbidden positions for S: 4, 5
So S must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus the pattern is:
A S _ A _  or  A _ S A _

We need valid 5-letter words of those two patterns using allowed letters.

Let’s try A S _ A _:
- A S K A N – not a word
- A S P A N – not a word
- A S D A N – not a word
- A S M A N – not a word
- A S T A N – not a word

Next, A _ S A _:
- A B S A L – not a word
- A D S A N – not a word
- A G S A N – not a word
- A M S A N – not a word
- A N S A R – not a word
- A N S A T – not a word
- A T S A M – not a word

Wait, is there a word A S K A T – no.

Actually, looking up, there’s the word:
A S K A T – not valid.

But there’s:
A S T A N – not valid.

This is tough. Perhaps A D S A N – no.

Another angle: maybe the word is A X S A Y – no.

I think the only valid word that fits is:
A S S A Y – but S is in positions 2 and 3, and position 4 is A, position 5 is Y. Let’s check:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (allowed), A in position 4 (matches), no R, O, E, L, I.
- ASSAY is indeed a valid word meaning to test or evaluate.

Let’s go with ASSAY.

<guess>ASSAY</guess>",ASSAY,"Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is correct in the first position.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5 (it was 4th in AROSE and 5th in ALIAS, both wrong).

Therefore:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere among positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, L, I (because L and I were just shown to be absent).

Permitted letters left (aside from S and the fixed A) are basically anything not yet eliminated. Common choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word starting with A, with S in either position 2 or 3, and using only the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
- A S _ _ _ : ASHY_, ASKS_, etc.  But we need 5 letters.
- A _ S _ _ : AMBUSH is too long; ABBAS (double B, double A) but A is already fixed in 1st and we don’t need another A; ANGST (but G, N, T allowed) – but N, G, T are allowed, and T hasn’t been eliminated.

Wait, ANGST has:
A N G S T – fits:
- A in position 1 ✓
- S in position 4 – but we just learned S cannot be in position 4 or 5, so invalid.

Next possible:
- A B S _ _ : ABSIT (valid word but uncommon)
- A H S _ _ : AHSAN (but has N, A again)
- A D S _ _ : ADSUM (rare)
- A M S _ _ : AMSIN (rare)

Look for more common words:
- A B S E N T – but E is banned.
- A S K _ _ : ASKED has E (banned); ASKER has E/R (banned); ASKEW has E (banned).
- A S P _ _ : ASPIC has I/C (I is banned).
- A S T _ _ : ASTER has E/R (both banned); ASTIR has I/R (banned).
- A S H _ _ : ASHEN has E/N (E banned); ASHES has E/S (E banned).
- A S C _ _ : ASCOT has O/T (O banned).
- A S S _ _ : ASSET has E (banned).
- A T S _ _ : ATSIN (not a word).
- A M U S S – not a word.

Hmm, the only common-ish word left that looks valid is:
A B S U T – no, not a word.

Wait, there’s:
A B U S E – but E banned.

Actually, let’s consider A C S _ _ or A N S _ _ with remaining letters.

Another candidate:
A N S E L – but E, L banned.

A N S A R – not a word.

A N S A S – not a word.

A B S I S – not a word.

Let me step back and list valid English words that:
1. Start with A
2. Have S in position 2 or 3
3. No R, O, E, L, I
4. No A in positions 2–5 (since the last guess ALIAS showed an extra A in position 4 which was marked correct, but that would imply a double A, which we didn’t see any indication of; the feedback simply marked the 4th letter A as ✓. But the secret word might have A in position 1 only. So we should avoid extra A’s unless necessary.)

Wait, the feedback for ALIAS was:
A(✓) L(x) I(x) A(✓) S(-)
This implies:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 4: A ✓
So the secret word is A _ _ A _ and has an S somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Forbidden letters now: R, O, E, L, I
Forbidden positions for S: 4, 5
So S must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus the pattern is:
A S _ A _  or  A _ S A _

We need valid 5-letter words of those two patterns using allowed letters.

Let’s try A S _ A _:
- A S K A N – not a word
- A S P A N – not a word
- A S D A N – not a word
- A S M A N – not a word
- A S T A N – not a word

Next, A _ S A _:
- A B S A L – not a word
- A D S A N – not a word
- A G S A N – not a word
- A M S A N – not a word
- A N S A R – not a word
- A N S A T – not a word
- A T S A M – not a word

Wait, is there a word A S K A T – no.

Actually, looking up, there’s the word:
A S K A T – not valid.

But there’s:
A S T A N – not valid.

This is tough. Perhaps A D S A N – no.

Another angle: maybe the word is A X S A Y – no.

I think the only valid word that fits is:
A S S A Y – but S is in positions 2 and 3, and position 4 is A, position 5 is Y. Let’s check:
- A(✓) S in position 2 (allowed), A in position 4 (matches), no R, O, E, L, I.
- ASSAY is indeed a valid word meaning to test or evaluate.

Let’s go with ASSAY.",Guess 3: ASSAY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
