For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words typically include several vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at the options, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It has common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are commonly used in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far:
- 1st letter: A (locked)
- 2nd letter: not R, O, S, E
- 3rd letter: not O, S, E
- 4th letter: not O, S, E
- 5th letter: not O, S, E

We also know the remaining letters must include R somewhere (but not in 2nd place) and cannot use O, S, E.

I need a word that starts with A, contains R (but not in position 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""ACRID"":
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains R in 3rd position (not violating the ""not 2nd"" rule)
- Uses C, I, D - none of which have been ruled out

Summary of what we know after two guesses:

Pattern locked so far:
- Position 1: A (correct)
Positions 2–5: cannot contain any of O, S, E, C, I, D.

Additional facts:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in both AROSE and ACRID it was merely “in the word but wrong position”).
- Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (which we know is in the word).

Need a valid 5-letter English word:
- Starts with A
- Uses R once, in position 4 or 5
- Uses only remaining allowed letters in the other three spots.

Possible candidates:
1) A B R _ _ – but “ABR…” possibilities are limited.
2) A _ _ R _ – e.g., AFRIT (I & T ruled out), AGRIN (I ruled out) …
3) A _ _ _ R – many more options.

Let’s choose a common pattern that fits the constraints and uses high-frequency remaining consonants.  
The word “ANGER” satisfies:
- A in first position (locked)
- R in last position (allowed)
- Letters N, G, E: but E was ruled out in guess 1.
Oops, E is disallowed.

Next candidate: “ANKER” – again E is out.

Next: “ARBOR” – but B, O are okay? O is ruled out.

Next: “ARMOR” – O and R acceptable? O is out.

Try “APART” – P, A, R, T – but A already locked in 1st; second A would be duplicate, which is fine but we want to test new letters.

Next idea: “ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – letters allowed (L, A, M, R not in excluded list), and R appears in position 4 (allowed).

Check exclusions for ALARM:
- Letters used: A, L, A, R, M
- None of O, S, E, C, I, D appear – good.
- R is in position 4 – allowed (not 2nd or 3rd).

Hence “ALARM” is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Looking at the options, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It has common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are commonly used in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far:
- 1st letter: A (locked)
- 2nd letter: not R, O, S, E
- 3rd letter: not O, S, E
- 4th letter: not O, S, E
- 5th letter: not O, S, E

We also know the remaining letters must include R somewhere (but not in 2nd place) and cannot use O, S, E.

I need a word that starts with A, contains R (but not in position 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""ACRID"":
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains R in 3rd position (not violating the ""not 2nd"" rule)
- Uses C, I, D - none of which have been ruled out

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after two guesses:

Pattern locked so far:
- Position 1: A (correct)
Positions 2–5: cannot contain any of O, S, E, C, I, D.

Additional facts:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in both AROSE and ACRID it was merely “in the word but wrong position”).
- Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (which we know is in the word).

Need a valid 5-letter English word:
- Starts with A
- Uses R once, in position 4 or 5
- Uses only remaining allowed letters in the other three spots.

Possible candidates:
1) A B R _ _ – but “ABR…” possibilities are limited.
2) A _ _ R _ – e.g., AFRIT (I & T ruled out), AGRIN (I ruled out) …
3) A _ _ _ R – many more options.

Let’s choose a common pattern that fits the constraints and uses high-frequency remaining consonants.  
The word “ANGER” satisfies:
- A in first position (locked)
- R in last position (allowed)
- Letters N, G, E: but E was ruled out in guess 1.
Oops, E is disallowed.

Next candidate: “ANKER” – again E is out.

Next: “ARBOR” – but B, O are okay? O is ruled out.

Next: “ARMOR” – O and R acceptable? O is out.

Try “APART” – P, A, R, T – but A already locked in 1st; second A would be duplicate, which is fine but we want to test new letters.

Next idea: “ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – letters allowed (L, A, M, R not in excluded list), and R appears in position 4 (allowed).

Check exclusions for ALARM:
- Letters used: A, L, A, R, M
- None of O, S, E, C, I, D appear – good.
- R is in position 4 – allowed (not 2nd or 3rd).

Hence “ALARM” is a strong next guess.

Good starting words typically include several vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at the options, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It has common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are commonly used in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far:
- 1st letter: A (locked)
- 2nd letter: not R, O, S, E
- 3rd letter: not O, S, E
- 4th letter: not O, S, E
- 5th letter: not O, S, E

We also know the remaining letters must include R somewhere (but not in 2nd place) and cannot use O, S, E.

I need a word that starts with A, contains R (but not in position 2), and avoids O, S, E.

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""ACRID"":
- Starts with A (✓)
- Contains R in 3rd position (not violating the ""not 2nd"" rule)
- Uses C, I, D - none of which have been ruled out
- Avoids O, S, E

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ACRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) R(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after two guesses:

Pattern locked so far:
- Position 1: A (correct)
Positions 2–5: cannot contain any of O, S, E, C, I, D.

Additional facts:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in both AROSE and ACRID it was merely “in the word but wrong position”).
- Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (which we know is in the word).

Need a valid 5-letter English word:
- Starts with A
- Uses R once, in position 4 or 5
- Uses only remaining allowed letters in the other three spots.

Possible candidates:
1) A B R _ _ – but “ABR…” possibilities are limited.
2) A _ _ R _ – e.g., AFRIT (I & T ruled out), AGRIN (I ruled out) …
3) A _ _ _ R – many more options.

Let’s choose a common pattern that fits the constraints and uses high-frequency remaining consonants.  
The word “ANGER” satisfies:
- A in first position (locked)
- R in last position (allowed)
- Letters N, G, E: but E was ruled out in guess 1.
Oops, E is disallowed.

Next candidate: “ANKER” – again E is out.

Next: “ARBOR” – but B, O are okay? O is ruled out.

Next: “ARMOR” – O and R acceptable? O is out.

Try “APART” – P, A, R, T – but A already locked in 1st; second A would be duplicate, which is fine but we want to test new letters.

Next idea: “ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – letters allowed (L, A, M, R not in excluded list), and R appears in position 4 (allowed).

Check exclusions for ALARM:
- Letters used: A, L, A, R, M
- None of O, S, E, C, I, D appear – good.
- R is in position 4 – allowed (not 2nd or 3rd).

Hence “ALARM” is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ACRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) R(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: ALARM -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) A(-) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. A(✓) – still locked in 1st position.
2. L(✓) – locked in 2nd position.
3. A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (we already have A in 1st, so duplicate A is possible but not here).
4. R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in the 4th position; earlier we learned it is also not in 2nd or 3rd. Therefore R must be in 5th position.
5. M(x) – M is not in the word.

Current certainty:
- Positions 1-2: A L _ _ _
- Position 5: must be R
So the word shape is A L _ _ R

Letters that cannot appear anywhere: O, S, E, C, I, D, M
Letters still allowed (besides the fixed A, L, R): B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form AL _ _ R with only the allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words:
- ALGAR – but G, A, R are allowed (A already used twice, allowed)
- ALGAR is valid (variant of alder, a tree)
- ALGAR uses G and A again, both allowed.

Another candidate: ALTHR – not a word.
- ALGAR seems the only common pattern left.

Therefore: ALGAR

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: A (✓)
   - Position 2: L (✓)
   - Position 5: R (✓)

2. From Guess 4 (ALGAR): G(x) → G is NOT in the word at all.

3. From Guess 4: A(✓) in position 4 → the 4th letter is A.

4. Word pattern so far:
   A L _ A R

5. Letters already used: A, L, R  
   Letters ruled out: O, S, E, C, I, D, M, G

6. Remaining allowed letters for position 3:  
   B, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

7. Need a common 5-letter English word of the form AL _ A R.

Scanning the dictionary:
- ALBAR – but B is allowed.
- ALFAR – F is allowed.
- ALKAR – K is allowed.
- ALVAR – V is allowed.
- ALFAR is a legitimate word (a type of Islamic scholar), but ALBAR seems simpler and more common (an Arabic name/measure).

Between ALBAR and ALFAR, ALBAR uses B which is a common consonant.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALBAR.
