- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in the English language. Some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

Looking at these, a strong starting word would be one that includes several of these high-frequency letters. ""ARISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination of letters should help me identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions. If none of these letters appear, that would also be very informative as it would narrow down the possibilities significantly.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E, but not A or I.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter English word that uses R, S, E (with the above positional constraints), plus two other letters (not A or I).

Common letters still available: T, N, L, D, C, O, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R, S, E in new positions and introduces T and O.

A good candidate is “STORE”.
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since it couldn’t be in 4).
- T is new.
- O is new.
- R is now in position 3 (allowed, since it couldn’t be in 2).
- E is now in position 5 (disallowed, since E can’t be in 5 per feedback). So “STORE” is invalid because E would be in position 5.

Next candidate: “ROTES”.
- R in 1 (allowed).
- O new.
- T new.
- E in 4 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed, since it couldn’t be in 4).

This looks valid.

Let’s tabulate everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (so far):
A, I, O

Letters that ARE in the word (but in unknown positions):
R, S, T, E

Positional information so far:
- R is not in position 1 (from ROTES feedback) and not in position 2 (from ARISE feedback)
- S is not in position 4 (from ARISE feedback) and not in position 5 (from ROTES feedback)
- T is somewhere in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTES feedback)
- E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5 (from ARISE feedback) and not in position 4 (from ROTES feedback)

So R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
S can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
T can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a word that contains R, S, T, E and one additional legal letter (no A, I, O).

Common additional letters we haven’t used yet: N, L, D, U, C, H, etc.

We want to arrange R, S, T, E plus one new letter so that the positional constraints above are satisfied.

Possible candidates:
- N, L, D, U, C, H, etc.

Let’s try a word that uses U as the extra letter and see if we can place R, S, T, E legally.

One candidate is “UTERS”. But U is in position 1, T in 2, E in 3, R in 4, S in 5. Let’s check constraints:
- R is allowed in position 4 (was barred from 1 and 2) ✓
- S is in 5, but S cannot be in 5 (from ROTES) ✗

So “UTERS” is invalid.

Another candidate: “TREES”.
- T in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (barred from 2) ✗

Invalid.

Next: “STERN”.
- S in 1 (allowed)
- T in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (allowed)
- R in 4 (allowed)
- N is new.

Check constraints:
- R not in 1,2 → 4 is ok ✓
- S not in 4,5 → 1 is ok ✓
- T not in 3 → 2 is ok ✓
- E not in 4,5 → 3 is ok ✓

“STERN” uses S, T, E, R plus N, satisfies all constraints, and is a valid English word.
