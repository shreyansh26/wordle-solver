Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback to work with, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include a good mix of vowels and consonants

Common high-frequency letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C
Good vowels to test early: A, E, I, O, U

Looking at these criteria, ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters without repeats, maximizing our chances of hitting letters in the secret word.

- Position 4 is E (E ✓ in guess 2).
- T must be somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
- We still need three more letters, none of which are S, L, A, I, M, R.

Available letters (that are common and not yet ruled out):
   B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
   - Has E in position 4.
   - Has T in 2, 3, or 5.
   - Introduces several new common letters to maximize info.

Candidate words:
   - TOKEN (T in pos 1 – already bad, skip)
   - WROTE (R already out)
   - COTED (D is new, but O and D are okay; position 4 is E; T is in pos 3 – fits all rules)
   - PONTE (N, O, P new; T in pos 4 conflicts with E, so no)
   - COTED is valid and only uses new letters C, O, D plus T, E in allowed positions.

Let’s go with COTED:
   positions: 1=C, 2=O, 3=T, 4=E, 5=D
   T is in position 3 (allowed)
   E is in position 4 (exactly correct)
   letters C, O, D are new and common.

Consolidating all feedback:

Known facts
1. The word must contain T and E.
2. Position 4 is E (✓ from TIMER).
3. Position 3 is T (✓ from COTED).
4. T may not be in positions 1, 4, 5 and now we know it is in position 3, so that is fixed.
5. E may not be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 and now we know it is in position 4, so that is fixed.
6. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, I, M, R, C, D, plus O is now known to be in the word but not at position 2 (it got “-” in COTED).

Current pattern
 _ _ T E _  (positions 3 and 4 are locked)

We need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.  
Eliminated letters: S L A I M R C D  
O is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (already occupied by T), so O must be in position 1 or 5.

Common remaining consonants and vowels: B, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, W, Y, plus O.

Let’s test O in position 1:  
O _ T E _  → needs a final consonant.  
Good candidates: B, N, P, F.

Example word: ONTEN – but N is okay, but ONTEN is not a valid English word.  
Let’s pick a real word: OTTER – but R is already eliminated.  
OFTER – invalid.  
OPTEN – invalid.  
ONSET – S is out, N is okay but S is out.  
OBTEN – invalid.  
OUTER – R is out.  
OPTEH – invalid.  
OPTEG – invalid.  
OFTEN – letters O, F, T, E, N.  All constraints are met:
   – O is allowed in position 1 (not eliminated and may be anywhere except 2).  
   – F and N are new letters.  
   – Word is valid English.

Therefore OFTEN is a perfect next guess.
