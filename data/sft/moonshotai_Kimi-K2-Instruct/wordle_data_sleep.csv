For my first 5-letter word guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can provide good initial information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good starting word should use several of these. 

""STONE"" is a good choice because it contains S, T, O, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on STONE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T, O, and N are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and contains E somewhere after position 1.  
Letters to avoid: T, O, N.  
Letters still possible everywhere except positions 2-3-4-5 for E.

I need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has an E not in position 5, and avoids T, O, N.  
Good candidates: SLEEP, SHEET, SPEAR, STEAL (but STEAL uses T), SHEEP, etc.

I'll try ""SHEEP"" next – it starts with S, contains E in position 2 (new spot), and avoids T, O, N.

So far we know:
- First letter is S (✓ from both guesses).
- Letters present: S, E, E, P (from SHEEP feedback: second E and P are marked ✓, meaning they are in the correct positions).
- Letters absent: T, O, N (from STONE), H (from SHEEP).

From SHEEP:
- Position 2: H is absent (x).
- Position 3: E is in the correct position (✓).
- Position 4: E is in the correct position (✓).
- Position 5: P is in the correct position (✓).

So the word must be: S _ E E P, where the blank (position 2) can be any letter except T, O, N, H.

Possible letters for position 2 (must form a valid 5-letter word): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words in the pattern S _ E E P:
- SLEEP (but E is already in position 3, so SLEEP would have E in positions 2,3,4,5 - but position 2 must be a new letter)
- SPEER (but P is in position 5, not 2)
- SBEEP - invalid
- SKEEP - invalid
- SCREEP - invalid
- SWEEP - W is allowed, and SWEEP is valid.

SWEEP fits the pattern: S-W-E-E-P, with W in position 2 (not excluded), and all other positions match the ✓ marks from SHEEP.

Let me verify:
- S (✓) - matches position 1.
- W - new letter, allowed in position 2.
- E (✓) - matches position 3.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good starting word should use several of these. \n\n""STONE"" is a good choice because it contains S, T, O, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many words.

From the feedback so far:
- The word must start with S and end with EEP (positions 1,3,4,5 are all ✓).
- Position 2 is the only unknown; letters ruled out so far from any position: T, O, N, H, W.
- Therefore the second letter must be one of the remaining 21 letters.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ E E P where the blank is not T, O, N, H, W.

Some possibilities:
- SLEEP (but that would have two E’s in a row at positions 2–3, giving the word SLEPE which is invalid)
- SBEEP → invalid
- SGEEP → invalid
- SJEEP → invalid
- SKEET → invalid
- SMEEP → invalid
- SREEP → invalid
- SUEEP → invalid
- SVEEP → invalid

The only common English word fitting these constraints is “SLEEP.”
