For the first word, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give me good information about what letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. To maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word, I'll use a word that contains several of these common letters. 

A good starting word is often one that uses 5 distinct common letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ROAST
- STARE
- RAINS

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses R, A, I, S, E - five very common letters. This gives me a good chance to get hits on letters and their positions.

From the first guess (RAISE) we now know:
- A is in the word and is in the 2nd position (✓).
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓).
- R, I, and S are NOT in the word (x).

Next, I want to test several new common consonants while preserving the known A and E. Good choices to test now are D, N, T, L, M, etc., to maximize coverage of likely letters while avoiding R, I, S.

A word that uses new common letters and fits the pattern _ A _ _ E is “PLANE” (P, L, N tested; A and E fixed). Another option is “TAMED,” but it re-uses D less common. “GLADE” uses G, L, D. Among these, “PLANE” tests three new consonants P, L, N while leaving A and E in their confirmed positions.

From the three guesses we have so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - A is fixed at position 2 and E at position 5.  
   - Eliminated letters: R, I, S.

2. PLANE → P(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)  
   - P is fixed at position 1 and E at position 5 (confirming the earlier E).  
   - Eliminated letters: L, N (and still R, I, S).

3. PACED → P(✓) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) D(x)  
   - Confirms P–A–_–_–E pattern.  
   - Eliminates C and D.

So we now know:

Structure: P A _ _ E  
Eliminated letters: R, I, S, L, N, C, D

Remaining common consonants that can fit positions 3 & 4: B, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y.

Possible pairs:  
- B and M → P A B M E (not a word)  
- B and G → P A B G E (not a word)  
- G and M → P A G M E (not a word)  
- M and B → P A M B E (not a word)  
- M and E (already fixed)  
- G and E (already fixed)  
- H and M → P A H M E (not a word)  
- K and E (already fixed)  
- T and H → P A T H E (path is a valid word)  
- V and E (already fixed)  
- W and E (already fixed)  
- Y and E (already fixed)

The only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern P A _ _ E and uses remaining letters is “PATHE” or “P AG??” but “PATH” is only 4 letters, so “PATHE” isn’t a common word. Wait, “PAG…E” – what about “PAGLE”? Not a word. “PAB…E” – no. Let me consider “PAG…E” again: “PAGER”? Yes, PAGER is a 5-letter word that fits P A _ _ E with G in position 3 and R in position 4. But R was eliminated in guess 1. So R is out.

Next alternative: “PAM…E”? PAMPE is not a word. “PAG…E” with G and then another letter? “PAG…E” with the remaining valid letters: G and T? PAGTE isn’t a word. Let me check “PAT…E” – we have P A T _ E, with remaining letters: B, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y. The only valid English word is P A T H E (pathe) but that’s not common. Next, “P A T T E” – not valid. “P A T C H” – but C is eliminated. 

Wait, another possibility: “P A G E D” – but D is eliminated. “P A G E R” – but R is eliminated. “P A G E S” – but S is eliminated. 

Let me list all valid English words with pattern P A _ _ E and check against eliminated letters (R, I, S, L, N, C, D):

- P A B L E – PABLE (not a word)  
- P A C K E – PACK E (invalid)  
- P A C E R – PACER (C and R eliminated)  
- P A D D E – PADRE (D eliminated)  
- P A G E R – PAGER (R eliminated)  
- P A H O E – PAHOE (not a word)  
- P A I N E – PAINE (I eliminated)  
- P A K E D – PAKED (KED combo often invalid)  
- P A M E L – PAMEL (invalid)  
- P A M P E – PAMPE (invalid)  
- P A N E L – PANEL (N eliminated)  
- P A P E R – PAPER (R eliminated)  
- P A R E D – PARED (R eliminated)  
- P A R E S – PARES (R, S eliminated)  
- P A S S E – PASSE (S eliminated)  
- P A T T E – PATTE (rare)  
- P A V E D – PAVED (D eliminated)  
- P A V E R – PAVER (R eliminated)  
- P A W E D – PAWED (D eliminated)  
- P A W E R – PAWER (R eliminated)  
- P A Y E E – PAYEE (valid word, fits, uses Y and another E – but E already fixed)

No valid common word except “PAYEE” and “PATTE”. PATTE is rare. PAYEE is valid and fits P A _ _ E with Y in position 3 and E in 4. E in 4 is allowed since E is in the word (position 5), and the feedback for E in guess 3 (PACED) shows E(✓) at position 5, so position 4 can also be E (it would just be a repeat letter).

Let me confirm: PAYEE – P A Y E E.  
- P and A are fixed.  
- Y and E are new letters to test (except E is already known).  
- No excluded letters used.  

PAYEE is a valid 5-letter word.  

Hence, the next best guess is PAYEE.
