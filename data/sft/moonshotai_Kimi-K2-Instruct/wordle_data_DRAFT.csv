Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. Common strategies for Wordle's first guess include:
1. Using words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize information
3. Choosing words with high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities

Good options include:
- ""RAISE"" (3 vowels + R, S)
- ""AROSE"" (4 vowels + R, S)
- ""SLATE"" (common consonants + 2 vowels)
- ""CRANE"" (good consonant coverage + 2 vowels)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, providing good coverage for the first guess.

R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
I(x), S(x), E(x) – I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and A, each somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain I, S, E.

Letters left: R and A must be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5.
We need three more letters from the remaining 21 (excluding I, S, E).

Let’s look for a word that:
- Uses R and A in positions 3–5.
- Uses three other distinct letters (not I, S, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter word.

A good candidate is ""TORCH"":
- T – new, high-frequency letter.
- O – new vowel.
- R – in position 3, satisfying R(-) (not in position 1).
- C – new consonant.
- H – new consonant.

This tests T, O, C, H and keeps R in position 3 while avoiding A for now (since A must not be in position 2 and we don’t know where it goes yet).

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" – but I is forbidden.
Alternative: ""RATIO"" – I and O conflict (I is forbidden) and A in position 2 is invalid.

""TORCH"" is the better choice here as it introduces 4 new letters while respecting the constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

1. Using words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize information
3. Choosing words with high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities

Good options include:
- ""RAISE"" (3 vowels + R, S)
- ""AROSE"" (4 vowels + R, S)
- ""SLATE"" (common consonants + 2 vowels)
- ""CRANE"" (good consonant coverage + 2 vowels)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, providing good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
I(x), S(x), E(x) – I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and A, each somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain I, S, E.

Letters left: R and A must be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5.
We need three more letters from the remaining 21 (excluding I, S, E).

Common remaining letters: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, etc.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Uses R and A in positions 3–5.
- Uses three other distinct letters (not I, S, E).
- Is a valid 5-letter word.

A good candidate is ""TORCH"":
- T – new, high-frequency letter.
- O – new vowel.
- R – in position 3, satisfying R(-) (not in position 1).
- C – new consonant.
- H – new consonant.

This tests T, O, C, H and keeps R in position 3 while avoiding A for now (since A must not be in position 2 and we don’t know where it goes yet).

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" – but I is forbidden.
Alternative: ""RATIO"" – I and O conflict (I is forbidden) and A in position 2 is invalid.

""TORCH"" is the better choice here as it introduces 4 new letters while respecting the constraints.

- B R A F T → ""BRAFT"" – valid word.
- D R A F T → ""DRAFT"" – valid word.
- M R A F T → ""MRAFT"" – not a word.

Between ""BRAFT"" and ""DRAFT"":
- ""DRAFT"" is a more common word and fits perfectly: D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5).
- Letters are all allowed: D and F are new and not forbidden.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""DRAFT"".

<guess>DRAFT</guess>",DRAFT,"From the feedback on GRANT:
- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in position 2 and is correct.
- A(✓) – A is in position 3 and is correct.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(✓) – T is in position 5 and is correct.

So the current known structure is:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: T
- Forbidden letters so far: I, S, E, O, C, H, U, L, G, N

Letters we still need for positions 1 and 4 must come from the remaining alphabet, excluding all forbidden letters.

Allowed letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc. (consonants and the already-used vowel A which is already placed).

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4 from this remaining set. 

Looking for common combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, M, P
- Position 4: B, D, F, M, P, etc., but must be different from position 1.
