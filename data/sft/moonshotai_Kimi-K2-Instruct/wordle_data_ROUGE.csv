For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common, high-frequency letters to maximize the information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with five unique letters that cover a broad range of common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. My goal is to eliminate or confirm as many of these as possible in one guess. 

A classic and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓)

So the secret word is of the form ???E?. The letters R and O are present somewhere but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. The letters A and S are absent.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency consonants I haven't tried yet include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc. The vowels I haven't confirmed are I and U.

A strong second guess should test several of these new letters while respecting what we already know. A good candidate is ""TILER"" because:
- It keeps E in the correct last position.
- It tests T, I, L which are new letters.
- It reuses R but places it in a different position (5 instead of 2) to check if R belongs here.
- It avoids A, O, S which we know are either absent or misplaced.

This gives us new information about T, I, L while also checking another possible position for R.

1. From AROSE:

   – R (-) → present, but not in position 2  
   – O (-) → present, but not in position 3  
   – S (x) → absent  
   – E (✓) → present and must be in position 5  

2. From TILER:

   – L (x) → absent  
   – E (-) → present, but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in 5)  
   – R (-) → present, but not in position 5  

So the word is _ _ _ _ E, and the letters we know are:
- Definitely included: R, O, E  
- Definitely excluded: A, S, T, I, L  

We need five-letter words that:
- End with E  
- Contain both R and O somewhere in the first four positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out  

Good remaining common consonants to test: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: only U is still possible besides the already known O.

A strong candidate is “CRONE” because:
- Ends with E ✔  
- Contains R and O ✔  
- Places R in position 3 and O in position 2, neither of which have been ruled out for those letters  
- Introduces C and N which we haven’t tested yet

Let's summarize everything we know so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E is fixed in position 5).
2. Letters known to be in the word: R, O (from AROSE) and E (position 5).
3. Letters known to be absent: A, S, T, I, L, C, N.

From feedback:
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from CRONE). So R must be in position 1 or 4.
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from CRONE). So O must be in position 1 or 4.

Given that both R and O must appear in positions 1 or 4, and they cannot both be in the same position, the possibilities are:
- R in 1 and O in 4 → R _ _ O E
- O in 1 and R in 4 → O _ _ R E

Now, we need to find valid 5-letter words matching one of these two patterns using letters not yet ruled out (remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.).

Looking at the first pattern (R _ _ O E), possible words include:
- RODEO (but D is not ruled out yet, and two O's would make it R O D E O which has the correct pattern)
- ROGUE (R O G U E) - but we don't know about G and U yet
- ROWER (but has two R's)
- ROUGE (R O U G E) - but G and U are untested

Looking at the second pattern (O _ _ R E), possible words include:
- OMBRE (O M B R E) - but M and B are untested
- OCHRE (O C H R E) - but C is already ruled out
- OUTRE (O U T R E) - but T is ruled out
- ODOUR - but has O in position 1 and 4, which conflicts with needing R in 4
- ORDER - but D is untested and R would be in position 4 which is allowed

""ORDER"" seems promising because:
- Fits O _ _ R E pattern
- Uses D (untested) and R in position 4 (allowed)
- Only uses letters not yet ruled out (O, R, D, E)
- It's a common word

Let me consider if any other better options exist, but ""ORDER"" appears to be the most logical next guess based on current information.

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word ends with E
- Must contain both R and O (but not in positions tested)
- R and O must be in positions 1 or 4 (since other positions are ruled out)
- Letters C, N, A, S, T, I, L are definitely out

The possible patterns are R _ _ O E or O _ _ R E. Among valid words fitting these constraints, ""ORDER"" is a strong candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

A good strategy is to pick a word with five unique letters that cover a broad range of common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. My goal is to eliminate or confirm as many of these as possible in one guess. 

A classic and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓)

So the secret word is of the form ???E?. The letters R and O are present somewhere but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. The letters A and S are absent.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency consonants I haven't tried yet include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc. The vowels I haven't confirmed are I and U.

A strong second guess should test several of these new letters while respecting what we already know. A good candidate is ""TILER"" because:
- It keeps E in the correct last position.
- It tests T, I, L which are new letters.
- It reuses R but places it in a different position (5 instead of 2) to check if R belongs here.
- It avoids A, O, S which we know are either absent or misplaced.

This gives us new information about T, I, L while also checking another possible position for R.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   – A (x) → absent  
   – R (-) → present, but not in position 2  
   – O (-) → present, but not in position 3  
   – S (x) → absent  
   – E (✓) → present and must be in position 5  

2. From TILER:
   – T (x) → absent  
   – I (x) → absent  
   – L (x) → absent  
   – E (-) → present, but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in 5)  
   – R (-) → present, but not in position 5  

So the word is _ _ _ _ E, and the letters we know are:
- Definitely included: R, O, E  
- Definitely excluded: A, S, T, I, L  

We need five-letter words that:
- End with E  
- Contain both R and O somewhere in the first four positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out  

Good remaining common consonants to test: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: only U is still possible besides the already known O.

A strong candidate is “CRONE” because:
- Ends with E ✔  
- Contains R and O ✔  
- Places R in position 3 and O in position 2, neither of which have been ruled out for those letters  
- Introduces C and N which we haven’t tested yet  

Therefore, CRONE is a logical next guess.

2. Letters known to be in the word: R, O (from AROSE) and E (position 5).
3. Letters known to be absent: A, S, T, I, L, C, N.

From feedback:
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from CRONE). So R must be in position 1 or 4.
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from CRONE). So O must be in position 1 or 4.

Given that both R and O must appear in positions 1 or 4, and they cannot both be in the same position, the possibilities are:
- R in 1 and O in 4 → R _ _ O E
- O in 1 and R in 4 → O _ _ R E

Now, we need to find valid 5-letter words matching one of these two patterns using letters not yet ruled out (remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.).

Looking at the first pattern (R _ _ O E), possible words include:
- RODEO (but D is not ruled out yet, and two O's would make it R O D E O which has the correct pattern)
- ROGUE (R O G U E) - but we don't know about G and U yet
- ROWER (but has two R's)
- ROUGE (R O U G E) - but G and U are untested

Looking at the second pattern (O _ _ R E), possible words include:
- OMBRE (O M B R E) - but M and B are untested
- OCHRE (O C H R E) - but C is already ruled out
- OUTRE (O U T R E) - but T is ruled out
- ODOUR - but has O in position 1 and 4, which conflicts with needing R in 4
- ORDER - but D is untested and R would be in position 4 which is allowed

""ORDER"" seems promising because:
- Fits O _ _ R E pattern
- Uses D (untested) and R in position 4 (allowed)
- Only uses letters not yet ruled out (O, R, D, E)
- It's a common word

Let me consider if any other better options exist, but ""ORDER"" appears to be the most logical next guess based on current information.Based on the feedback so far, we know:

From the latest feedback on ORDER:

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2  
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word  
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4  
- R(-) – the second R is also not in position 5 (but we already know E must be in position 5 anyway)

Key facts updated:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (position 5 is fixed as E).  
2. Must contain both O and R somewhere in positions 1-4.  
3. From earlier guesses, we already ruled out: A, S, T, I, L, C, N, D.  
4. From CRONE we know R is not in position 3, from ORDER we know it’s not in 2 or 5, so R must be in position 1 or 4.  
5. From AROSE we know O is not in position 3, from ORDER we know it’s not in position 1, so O must be in position 2 or 4.  

Since both R and O must appear and can’t both occupy position 4, we have exactly two possible patterns left:

- R O _ _ E  
- _ O _ R E  

We need a valid 5-letter word matching one of these that uses only the remaining allowed letters (B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.).

Looking at the first pattern R O _ _ E:

- R O B E E – invalid (double E).  
- R O M E O – invalid (ends with O).

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2  
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word  
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4  
- R(-) – the second R is also not in position 5 (but we already know E must be in position 5 anyway)

Key facts updated:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (position 5 is fixed as E).  
2. Must contain both O and R somewhere in positions 1-4.  
3. From earlier guesses, we already ruled out: A, S, T, I, L, C, N, D.  
4. From CRONE we know R is not in position 3, from ORDER we know it’s not in 2 or 5, so R must be in position 1 or 4.  
5. From AROSE we know O is not in position 3, from ORDER we know it’s not in position 1, so O must be in position 2 or 4.  

Since both R and O must appear and can’t both occupy position 4, we have exactly two possible patterns left:

- R O _ _ E  
- _ O _ R E  

We need a valid 5-letter word matching one of these that uses only the remaining allowed letters (B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.).

Looking at the first pattern R O _ _ E:

- R O B E E – invalid (double E).  
- R O M E O – invalid (ends with O).

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common, high-frequency letters to maximize the information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with five unique letters that cover a broad range of common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. My goal is to eliminate or confirm as many of these as possible in one guess. 

A classic and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓)

So the secret word is of the form ???E?. The letters R and O are present somewhere but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. The letters A and S are absent.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency consonants I haven't tried yet include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc. The vowels I haven't confirmed are I and U.

A strong second guess should test several of these new letters while respecting what we already know. A good candidate is ""TILER"" because:
- It keeps E in the correct last position.
- It tests T, I, L which are new letters.
- It reuses R but places it in a different position (5 instead of 2) to check if R belongs here.
- It avoids A, O, S which we know are either absent or misplaced.

This gives us new information about T, I, L while also checking another possible position for R.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TILER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) L(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   – A (x) → absent  
   – R (-) → present, but not in position 2  
   – O (-) → present, but not in position 3  
   – S (x) → absent  
   – E (✓) → present and must be in position 5  

2. From TILER:
   – T (x) → absent  
   – I (x) → absent  
   – L (x) → absent  
   – E (-) → present, but not in position 4 (we already know it’s in 5)  
   – R (-) → present, but not in position 5  

So the word is _ _ _ _ E, and the letters we know are:
- Definitely included: R, O, E  
- Definitely excluded: A, S, T, I, L  

We need five-letter words that:
- End with E  
- Contain both R and O somewhere in the first four positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out  

Good remaining common consonants to test: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: only U is still possible besides the already known O.

A strong candidate is “CRONE” because:
- Ends with E ✔  
- Contains R and O ✔  
- Places R in position 3 and O in position 2, neither of which have been ruled out for those letters  
- Introduces C and N which we haven’t tested yet  

Therefore, CRONE is a logical next guess.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TILER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) L(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize everything we know so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E is fixed in position 5).
2. Letters known to be in the word: R, O (from AROSE) and E (position 5).
3. Letters known to be absent: A, S, T, I, L, C, N.

From feedback:
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from CRONE). So R must be in position 1 or 4.
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from CRONE). So O must be in position 1 or 4.

Given that both R and O must appear in positions 1 or 4, and they cannot both be in the same position, the possibilities are:
- R in 1 and O in 4 → R _ _ O E
- O in 1 and R in 4 → O _ _ R E

Now, we need to find valid 5-letter words matching one of these two patterns using letters not yet ruled out (remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.).

Looking at the first pattern (R _ _ O E), possible words include:
- RODEO (but D is not ruled out yet, and two O's would make it R O D E O which has the correct pattern)
- ROGUE (R O G U E) - but we don't know about G and U yet
- ROWER (but has two R's)
- ROUGE (R O U G E) - but G and U are untested

Looking at the second pattern (O _ _ R E), possible words include:
- OMBRE (O M B R E) - but M and B are untested
- OCHRE (O C H R E) - but C is already ruled out
- OUTRE (O U T R E) - but T is ruled out
- ODOUR - but has O in position 1 and 4, which conflicts with needing R in 4
- ORDER - but D is untested and R would be in position 4 which is allowed

""ORDER"" seems promising because:
- Fits O _ _ R E pattern
- Uses D (untested) and R in position 4 (allowed)
- Only uses letters not yet ruled out (O, R, D, E)
- It's a common word

Let me consider if any other better options exist, but ""ORDER"" appears to be the most logical next guess based on current information.Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word ends with E
- Must contain both R and O (but not in positions tested)
- R and O must be in positions 1 or 4 (since other positions are ruled out)
- Letters C, N, A, S, T, I, L are definitely out

The possible patterns are R _ _ O E or O _ _ R E. Among valid words fitting these constraints, ""ORDER"" is a strong candidate.

Looking at the first pattern R O _ _ E:

- R O B E E – invalid (double E).  
- R O M E O – invalid (ends with O).  
- R O G U E – R O G U E fits (positions 1,2,3,4,5) and all letters are allowed.
