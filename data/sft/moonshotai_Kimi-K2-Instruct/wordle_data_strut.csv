For my first guess in Wordle, I want a word that contains common English letters and avoids rare ones to maximize the chance of getting feedback. A good first guess should ideally have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like T, N, S, R, L)
3. No duplicate letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (most common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of high-frequency letters across different positions.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S✓ Lx Ax T- Ex) we now know:

2. T is in the word but not in position 4 (must be in 2, 3, or 5).
3. L, A, E are not in the word at all.

Constraints so far:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains T somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Cannot contain L, A, E.

Next I want to test new common consonants and vowels while respecting these constraints. Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P. Good vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess that fits:
- Starts with S
- Uses new high-frequency letters
- Places T in a different position from 4
- Avoids L, A, E

""STORY"" looks good:
- S fixed at position 1
- T placed in position 2 (different from position 4)
- Uses new letters R, O, Y (Y sometimes acts as vowel)
- Avoids L, A, E.

This will give info about R, O, Y and confirm T's position.

Looking for a word that starts with ""STR"" and uses new common letters for positions 4 and 5. Good candidates would be ""STRUM"" or ""STRUN"" but these aren't valid words.

Valid options:
- STRUD (not a word)
- STRUT (valid word, uses U and T - but T is already used)
- STRUNK (too long)
- STRUNG (valid, uses U, N, G - but G hasn't been tested much)

""STRUNG"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Starts with STR
- Uses U and N (new letters)
- Uses G (new letter)
- All letters are in the allowed set

But since we only need to fill positions 4 and 5, and we have 3 tries left, we can be more strategic. ""STRUM"" is invalid (5 letters but not a common word). 

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with STR:
- STRUT (valid, but T is already used in position 2)
- STRAW (invalid - A is eliminated)
- STREP (invalid - E is eliminated)
- STRIP (already tried)
- STRUT is actually valid despite T repetition - but we might prefer to avoid letter repetition at this stage

Better option: ""STRUN"" isn't valid, but ""STRUM"" is questionable. Actually, ""STRUM"" is a valid word (as in strum a guitar).

But let's think differently - perhaps ""STRUCK"" is too long. 

Actually, looking back at valid 5-letter words starting with STR:
- STRUT (S T R U T) - uses U
- STRUM (S T R U M) - uses U and M

""STRUM"" uses two new letters (U and M) without repeating any, which is more informative.

Therefore, STRUM is the better choice as it tests two new letters (U and M) in positions 4 and 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good first guess should ideally have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like T, N, S, R, L)
3. No duplicate letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (most common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of high-frequency letters across different positions.

3. L, A, E are not in the word at all.

- Cannot contain L, A, E.

Next I want to test new common consonants and vowels while respecting these constraints. Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P. Good vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess that fits:
- Starts with S
- Uses new high-frequency letters
- Places T in a different position from 4
- Avoids L, A, E

""STORY"" looks good:
- S fixed at position 1
- T placed in position 2 (different from position 4)
- Uses new letters R, O, Y (Y sometimes acts as vowel)
- Avoids L, A, E.

This will give info about R, O, Y and confirm T's position.
