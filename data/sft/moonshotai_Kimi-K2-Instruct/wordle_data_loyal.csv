For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters. 

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a high chance of identifying at least some correct letters and their positions.

From the feedback on “AROSE”:
- A(-): letter A is in the word but NOT in the first position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but NOT in the third position.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. Word contains A (but not at position 1) and O (but not at position 3).
2. Word does NOT contain R, S, or E.

We now look for a five-letter word that:
- Uses A and O elsewhere than positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- Avoids R, S, E.

A common five-letter word that fits these constraints is “ALONG”:
- A is in position 2 (not 1) → satisfies the (-) feedback for A.
- O is in position 3 → but feedback said O is NOT in position 3, so “ALONG” fails.

Next candidate: “ABOUT”
- A(2), B(1), O(3) → O in position 3 again → fails.

Candidate: “ADOPT”
- A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5) → A is in position 1 (forbidden by feedback) → fails.

Candidate: “AVOID”
- A(1) → position 1 again → fails.

Candidate: “COBIA” (a type of fish)
- C(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), A(5)
  - A is in position 5 → satisfies (-) for A (not position 1).
  - O is in position 2 → satisfies (-) for O (not position 3).
  - No R, S, E → meets all constraints.

Another simpler, more common word: “COBRA” – but it contains R → disallowed.

Another word: “TOADY”
- T(1), O(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5)
  - A in position 3 → satisfies (-).
  - O in position 2 → satisfies (-).
  - No R, S, E → meets all constraints.

Between “COBIA” and “TOADY”, “TOADY” is more common and uses distinct letters to gather more information.

Thus, I choose “TOADY”.

Summarizing the information so far:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all: R, S, E, T, D.
2. Letters definitely **in** the word:
   - O (now confirmed to be in the **correct** position, position 2).
   - A (somewhere **other** than position 1 or 3).
   - Y (somewhere **other** than position 5).

Therefore, the word looks like: _  O  _  _  _

Known letters still to place: A, Y  
Unknown letters so far: we need two more consonants that are **not** R, S, T, D, and one more vowel that is **not** O, A, or E (since E is already excluded).

Valid vowels left: I, U  
Valid consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

We also know:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3, so A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Y cannot be in position 5, so Y must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters.  
We’ll test **COY** as a prefix, but that’s only three letters.  
A five-letter word that fits: **COY** needs two more letters.

How about **COYLY**?  
- C (1) → allowed.  
- O (2) ✓ – known correct.  
- Y (3) – allowed.  
- L (4) – allowed.  
- Y (5) – but Y can’t be in position 5, so **COYLY** fails.

- O (2) ✓ – correct.  
- Y (3) – allowed.  
- A (4) – allowed (A is allowed here).

No excluded letters are used, and all constraints are met.

Another possibility: **LOYAL**  
But L is repeated (L twice), and we have no information about L yet.  
Also, **LOYAL** has L in position 1 and 5, but we don’t know if L is in the word.  

Let’s go with **FOYAL** as it uses new letters and satisfies all constraints.

But wait, is **FOYAL** a valid English word?  
Upon checking, **LOYAL** is common, but **FOYAL** is uncommon or obscure.  

A better common word: **ROYAL** – but R is excluded.

- L (1) – allowed.  
- O (2) ✓ – correct.
