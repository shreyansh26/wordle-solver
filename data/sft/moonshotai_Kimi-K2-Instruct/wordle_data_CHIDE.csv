For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained about the secret word's letters and their possible positions. A word like ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)

This combination should give us solid initial feedback to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

- Letters R, A, and N are NOT in the word at all.

Thus the pattern is:

We need a 5-letter word that starts with C, ends with E, and does NOT contain R, A, or N.

Let’s think of common letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- CHIDE (contains H, I, D) – but has an I, which is fine.
- CLOSE – but has an O, L, and S.
- COMBE – but has an O and M.
- CRIME – has an R (invalid).
- CIVET – ends in T (invalid).
- CHOSE – has an H and S.

- CHIDE  – but D is okay, yet I is already used in CHIME
- CHILE  – L is okay, but we have not checked this yet
