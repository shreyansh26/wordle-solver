For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often contain vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L, etc. 

After considering common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
2. It has common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English
3. It follows a common letter pattern

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" provides good coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- Letters A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- Only the letter E is confirmed to be in the word, and it is at the last position (✓).

Since we now know:
- E is the fifth letter.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word.

We need a new word that ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S. Good letters to try next include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and vowels like I, U.

Possible candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – uses U, N, T, I, E, but ends in E (good) and avoids A, R, O, S. However, the E is already confirmed at the last position, so this is valid.
- ""UNTIE"" is actually a valid word and fits the constraints. Another option is ""UNTIL"" but it doesn't end in E.

Wait, let's think of other valid 5-letter words ending in E that exclude A, R, O, S:
- ""UNTIE"" ends in E, no A, R, O, S.
- ""UNTIE"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""INURE"" – but it has R, which is excluded.
""UNDUE"" – has U, N, D, U, E – no A, R, O, S, and ends in E. This is a valid word.

""UNDUE"" seems better as it tests U, N, D.

Another consideration: we want to test new common letters not yet tried. From AROSE, we've tested A, R, O, S, E. Remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, etc.

""UNTIE"" is valid, but ""UNDUE"" is also valid. Let's go with ""UNDUE"".

The best starting words often contain vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L, etc. 

After considering common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
2. It has common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English
3. It follows a common letter pattern

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" provides good coverage of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- Letters A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- Only the letter E is confirmed to be in the word, and it is at the last position (✓).

Since we now know:
- E is the fifth letter.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word.

We need a new word that ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S. Good letters to try next include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and vowels like I, U.

Possible candidates:
- ""UNTIE"" – uses U, N, T, I, E, but ends in E (good) and avoids A, R, O, S. However, the E is already confirmed at the last position, so this is valid.
- ""UNTIE"" is actually a valid word and fits the constraints. Another option is ""UNTIL"" but it doesn't end in E.

Wait, let's think of other valid 5-letter words ending in E that exclude A, R, O, S:
- ""UNTIE"" ends in E, no A, R, O, S.
- ""UNTIE"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""INURE"" – but it has R, which is excluded.
""UNDUE"" – has U, N, D, U, E – no A, R, O, S, and ends in E. This is a valid word.

""UNDUE"" seems better as it tests U, N, D.

Another consideration: we want to test new common letters not yet tried. From AROSE, we've tested A, R, O, S, E. Remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, etc.

""UNTIE"" is valid, but ""UNDUE"" is also valid. Let's go with ""UNDUE"".

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N  
2. Letter E is confirmed in the final position (slot 5).  
3. Letter D is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in slot 3, so it must appear in slot 1, 2, or 4).

So we need a five-letter word ending with E that:
- contains D exactly once (and not in slot 3).  
- does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N.

Possible remaining common consonants: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Possible remaining vowels: I, and possibly Y.

We want a word that:
- ends in E.  
- contains D in slot 1, 2, or 4.  
- avoids all excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- DITTE – but it has T twice and might be uncommon.  
- DILIE – not a real word.  
- TIDLE – not real.  
- PIXIE – lacks D.  
- BIDET – ends in T, not E.  
- PIXIE – no D.  
- MIDGE – ends in E, uses M, I, D, G, E. Let’s check:  
  – Letters: M, I, D, G, E  
  – No excluded letters (A, R, O, S, U, N).  
  – D is in slot 3 again, which contradicts feedback (D must move).  
- PIXIE – again no D.  
- PIXIE – not helpful.  
- Let’s try:  
  – ""PIXIE"" lacks D.  
  – ""PIXIE"" again lacks D.  

Better approach: construct a valid word with D in slot 1, 2, or 4, ending in E, using only allowed letters.

Consider:
- DRIVE – invalid, has R and V not yet tested but R is excluded.  
- PIXIE – again no D.  
- Let’s list allowed letters:  
  Allowed: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form real word).

Real candidate: ""PIXIE"" – no D.  
Another: ""PIXIE"" – no D.  

Wait, think of ""PIXIE"" – no D.  

Actually, let’s think systematically:  
We need a 5-letter word ending with E, with D in position 1, 2, or 4.  
No A, R, O, S, U, N.

Possible positions for D:  
1. D _ _ _ E  
2. _ D _ _ E  
4. _ _ _ D E  

Let’s brainstorm:

1. D _ _ _ E:  
   – DITTE – uncommon.  
   – DILIE – not a word.  
   – DIXIE – has X, I, E. Check exclusions: X is allowed.  
     ""DIXIE"" is a real word. Letters: D, I, X, I, E.  
     – No excluded letters (A, R, O, S, U, N).  
     – D is in slot 1, which satisfies ""D is in word but not slot 3"".  
     – E is in slot 5, confirmed correct.  
     – Uses new letters: D, I, X.

2. _ D _ _ E:  
   – PIDLE – not a word.  
   – TIDLE – not a word.  
   – BIDLE – not a word.  

3. _ _ _ D E:  
   – PIXDE – not a word.  
   – MIDGE – D is slot 3 again, invalid.  
   – BEDGE – B, E, D, G, E – but D is in slot 3.  

""DIXIE"" seems the best fit among real words.

Possible positions for D:  
1. D _ _ _ E  
2. _ D _ _ E  
4. _ _ _ D E  

Let’s brainstorm:

1. D _ _ _ E:  
   – DITTE – uncommon.  
   – DILIE – not a word.  
   – DIXIE – has X, I, E. Check exclusions: X is allowed.  
     ""DIXIE"" is a real word. Letters: D, I, X, I, E.  
     – No excluded letters (A, R, O, S, U, N).  
     – D is in slot 1, which satisfies ""D is in word but not slot 3"".  
     – E is in slot 5, confirmed correct.  
     – Uses new letters: D, I, X.

2. _ D _ _ E:  
   – PIDLE – not a word.  
   – TIDLE – not a word.  
   – BIDLE – not a word.  

3. _ _ _ D E:  
   – PIXDE – not a word.  
   – MIDGE – D is slot 3 again, invalid.  
   – BEDGE – B, E, D, G, E – but D is in slot 3.  

""DIXIE"" seems the best fit among real words.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Gathering what we know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, U, N, X

Letters confirmed to be in the word (✓ or –):  
- E is in the 5th position (fixed).  
- D is in the word but NOT in slot 1, 3 (from DIXIE and UNDUE).  
- I is in the word but NOT in slot 2, 4 (from DIXIE).

So far we have:

Slot 5 = E  
Slots 1 & 3 cannot be D (so D must be in 2 or 4)  
Slots 2 & 4 cannot be I (so I must be in 1 or 3)

Allowed letters: anything not in {A,R,O,S,U,N,X} plus the constraints above.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- ends in E  
- contains both D and I exactly once each  
- D is in 2 or 4  
- I is in 1 or 3  
- contains none of A,R,O,S,U,N,X  

Simple pattern enumeration:

Case 1) I _ D _ E  (I-1, D-3) — but D can’t be in 3, so skip.  
Case 2) I _ _ D E  (I-1, D-4)  → I _ _ D E  
Case 3) _ I D _ E  (I-2, D-3) — D can’t be in 3, so skip.  
Case 4) _ _ I D E  (I-3, D-4) → _ _ I D E  
Case 5) D I _ _ E  (D-1, I-2) — D can’t be in 1, so skip.  
Case 6) D _ I _ E  (D-1, I-3) — D can’t be in 1, so skip.  
Case 7) _ D I _ E  (D-2, I-3) → _ D I _ E  
Case 8) _ D _ I E  (D-2, I-4) — I can’t be in 4, so skip.  

Viable patterns left:
- I _ _ D E  
- _ _ I D E  
- _ D I _ E  

Need real words fitting any of these.

Pattern 1: I _ _ D E  
Possible: IMBED, IMPED  

Pattern 2: _ _ I D E  
Possible: GLIDE, PRIDE (but P,R not allowed), so GLIDE fits (G,L,I,D,E).  
But L is allowed, G is allowed, etc.

Pattern 3: _ D I _ E  
Possible: EDILE (not common), IDILE (not a word), BDICE (invalid), etc.  
Closest common word: “EDILE” but not really used.

Best real, common words:
- GLIDE (letters G,L,I,D,E; none forbidden)  
- IMBED (letters I,M,B,E,D; none forbidden)

GLIDE uses new letters G, L and fits the constraints perfectly.

Check GLIDE against constraints:
- ends in E ✔  
- contains D (position 4) ✔  
- contains I (position 3) ✔  
- no forbidden letters ✔  

Therefore guess GLIDE.

- D is in the word but NOT in slot 1, 3 (from DIXIE and UNDUE).  
- I is in the word but NOT in slot 2, 4 (from DIXIE).

So far we have:

Slot 5 = E  
Slots 1 & 3 cannot be D (so D must be in 2 or 4)  
Slots 2 & 4 cannot be I (so I must be in 1 or 3)

Allowed letters: anything not in {A,R,O,S,U,N,X} plus the constraints above.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- ends in E  
- contains both D and I exactly once each  
- D is in 2 or 4  
- I is in 1 or 3  
- contains none of A,R,O,S,U,N,X  

Simple pattern enumeration:

Case 1) I _ D _ E  (I-1, D-3) — but D can’t be in 3, so skip.  
Case 2) I _ _ D E  (I-1, D-4)  → I _ _ D E  
Case 3) _ I D _ E  (I-2, D-3) — D can’t be in 3, so skip.  
Case 4) _ _ I D E  (I-3, D-4) → _ _ I D E  
Case 5) D I _ _ E  (D-1, I-2) — D can’t be in 1, so skip.  
Case 6) D _ I _ E  (D-1, I-3) — D can’t be in 1, so skip.  
Case 7) _ D I _ E  (D-2, I-3) → _ D I _ E  
Case 8) _ D _ I E  (D-2, I-4) — I can’t be in 4, so skip.  

Viable patterns left:
- I _ _ D E  
- _ _ I D E  
- _ D I _ E  

Need real words fitting any of these.

Pattern 1: I _ _ D E  
Possible: IMBED, IMPED  

Pattern 2: _ _ I D E  
Possible: GLIDE, PRIDE (but P,R not allowed), so GLIDE fits (G,L,I,D,E).  
But L is allowed, G is allowed, etc.

Pattern 3: _ D I _ E  
Possible: EDILE (not common), IDILE (not a word), BDICE (invalid), etc.  
Closest common word: “EDILE” but not really used.

Best real, common words:
- GLIDE (letters G,L,I,D,E; none forbidden)  
- IMBED (letters I,M,B,E,D; none forbidden)

GLIDE uses new letters G, L and fits the constraints perfectly.

Check GLIDE against constraints:
- ends in E ✔  
- contains D (position 4) ✔  
- contains I (position 3) ✔  
- no forbidden letters ✔  

Therefore guess GLIDE.

Looking for real 5-letter words matching ??IDE.

A quick scan of common words:  
BIDE, CIDE (not real), FIDE (not common), HIDE, JIDE (no), KIDE (no), MIDE (no), PIDE (no), QIDE (no), RIDE (R excluded), SIDE (S excluded), TIDE, VIDE, WIDE, YIDE (no), ZIDE (no).

Valid, allowable options:
- BIDE  
- HIDE  
- TIDE  
- VIDE  
- WIDE

Any of these will meet all constraints. Choosing the most common letter in remaining slots, let’s start with BIDE.

Check: B and I are allowed, I is fixed, D is fixed, E is fixed. No forbidden letters appear.
