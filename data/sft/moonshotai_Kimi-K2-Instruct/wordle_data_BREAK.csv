For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

A classic and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels to quickly narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

Letters not in the word: S, L, T  
Letters that ARE somewhere in the word, but not in those positions: A, E  

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.  
- Does contain A and E, but A is not in the 3rd position and E is not in the 5th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions (A ≠ 3, E ≠ 5).
2. Avoids S, L, T entirely.
3. Introduces fresh, common letters to squeeze more information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, B, M, P, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A balanced word that uses A and E without their old positions, while adding several fresh consonants, is “REACT”.

Check:
- R, E, A, C, T  
- T appears here, but we already know T is not in the word (feedback for SLATE showed T(x)).  
So “REACT” is invalid because it contains T.

Next candidate: “PEACH”
Contains P, E, A, C, H  
- E is now in position 2 (allowed)  
- A is now in position 3 (but earlier feedback said A is not in position 3) → invalid.

Next: “CREAM”
C, R, E, A, M  
- A is in position 4 (allowed)  
- E is in position 3 (allowed)  
- Does not use S, L, T  
- Uses new letters: C, R, M

Letters used so far:
- R fixed in position 2
- E fixed in position 3
- A fixed in position 4
- K fixed in position 5

Letters not in the word at all: S, L, T, C, M, F

Only the first letter is unknown. It must be a letter that hasn’t appeared yet and is valid in English five-letter words ending “REAK”. 

Possible first letters still available (avoiding S, L, T, C, M, F): B, D, G, H, I, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common real words with pattern ?REAK:
- BREAK – but B has not been tried yet and is allowed.
- DREAK – not a valid English word.
- GREAK – not a valid English word.
- HREAK – not a valid English word.
- PREAK – not a valid English word.
- WREAK – valid.

Between BREAK and WREAK, BREAK is more common, but both fit. Since we have only one position left to determine and both are valid, we’ll try the more frequent one first.

So the guess is BREAK.
