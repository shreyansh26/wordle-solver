For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at common letters, vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N are good choices. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters that could appear in the secret word. It also has the advantage of containing multiple vowels, which helps narrow down vowel positions quickly.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- A is correct in position 2 (second letter is A)
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

- Remaining alphabet: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z

- RALLY (uses L, Y)

- RAVEN (uses V, N, but has E)
- RACON (not common)
- RATIO (has I, O)
- RAVIN (not common)
- RATAL (not common)
- RAMEN (has E)

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words. \n\nLooking at common letters, vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N are good choices. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:\n- R (very common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- I (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage of common letters that could appear in the secret word. It also has the advantage of containing multiple vowels, which helps narrow down vowel positions quickly.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is correct in position 1 (first letter is R)\n- A is correct in position 2 (second letter is A)\n- I, S, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Word pattern: R A _ _ _\n- Letters to exclude: I, S, E\n- Remaining alphabet: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z\n\nNow we need a word that starts with 'RA' and avoids I, S, E. \n\nCommon 5-letter words fitting this pattern:\n- RADIO (but has I, so invalid)\n- RALLY (uses L, Y)\n- RANGE (uses N, G, E – E is excluded)\n- RAPID (uses P, D, but has I)\n- RAVEN (uses V, N, but has E)\n- RACON (not common)\n- RATIO (has I, O)\n- RAVIN (not common)\n- RATAL (not common)\n- RAMEN (has E)\n\nLooking at remaining options, 'RALLY' is a common word that fits perfectly:\n- Starts with RA\n- Uses L and Y (letters not yet excluded)\n- Doesn't use I, S, or E\n\n<guess>RALLY</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: RALLY -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n\nPosition 1 = R  \nPosition 2 = A  \n\nLetters that are NOT in the word at all: I, S, E, L, Y  \n\nLetters still available: B C D F G H J K M N O P Q T U V W X Z\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that starts with “RA” and uses only letters from the remaining pool.\n\nSome patterns we could try:\n- RA _ _ D (e.g., RABID – but B, D are available, I is blocked)  \n- RA _ _ N (e.g., RACON – but C, O, N are available)  \n- RA _ _ M (e.g., RAGAM – but G, M are available, A is repeated and already correct)\n\nLooking at common English words:\n- RACON – not common\n- RABID – has I\n- RADON – has O, N which are still allowed\n- RADAR – has D, second R would be in position 5, but R is already in position 1, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed.

What we now know from the three previous guesses:

1. Position 1 = R
2. Position 2 = A
3. Position 4 = O
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: I, S, E, L, Y, D, N

That leaves these letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern:
R A _ O _

Let’s list common English words that fit R A _ O _ and whose remaining letters are in the allowed set:

- RATIO – contains I (forbidden)
- RADIO – contains I and D (both forbidden)
- RACON – contains N (forbidden)
- RAJON – contains N (forbidden)
- RAMON – contains M, O, N – N forbidden
- RAZOR – uses Z and R. R is already in position 1, but we don’t yet know whether repeats are allowed, so let’s test RAZOR. It fits the pattern and only uses allowed letters (Z, R).

Since RAZOR seems to be the only common word left that fits all constraints, we’ll make that our next guess.
