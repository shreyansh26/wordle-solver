For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about many possible letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""STARE"" is a popular first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters that might be in the secret word and get useful feedback.

The feedback tells us:

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   S, T, A, E, C, Y  
   (from the first guess: S, T, A, E; from the second guess: C, Y)

2. Letters that ARE in the word but currently in wrong positions:  
   - R (from both guesses)  
   - O (from the second guess)

3. Letters that ARE in the word and ARE in the correct position:  
   - N in position 4 (from the second guess: N✓)

So the target word looks like: _ _ _ N _  
It also contains R and O somewhere outside their previous positions.

Letters we have not tried yet that are still possible include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 4.  
- Contains R and O in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not where they were: R was in positions 2 and 3, O was in position 3).  
- No S, T, A, E, C, Y.

A promising candidate: “FROND”
- F, R, O, N, D  
- N is in position 4 ✔  
- R is in position 2 (was in 2 or 3 before, so still allowed)  
- O is in position 3 (was in 3 before → conflict, so no, this won’t work).

Next candidate: “MORON” – but it repeats O.

Next: “BRONX” – X is allowed, but X is rare; let’s try something more common.

Next: “GROIN” – N in 5, not 4, so no.

Next: “PRION” – N in 4, P, R, I, O are all fresh positions.  
R is now in position 2 (previously was in 2 or 3, so still technically “wrong position” info).  
O is now in position 3 (again was in 3 before → conflict, so no).

Next: “DRONE” – E is forbidden.

Next: “DROWN” – N in 4, D, R, O, W.  
R is in 2 (was in 2/3 before → still not 4, so ok).  
O is in 3 (was in 3 before → conflict, so no).

Next: “WRONG” – N in 4, W, R, O, G.  
R is in 2 (ok), O is in 3 (again conflict).

Next: “ROUND” – N in 4, R, O, U, D.  
R in 1 (new), O in 2 (new), U and D are new.  
This fits all constraints:
- N is in 4 ✔  
- R and O are present, and neither is in their previous excluded positions.  
- No forbidden letters.

So “ROUND” is a valid next guess.

Let's update what we now know from all three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x)
- S, T, A, E (from STARE)
- C, Y (from CRONY)
- U, D (from ROUND)

Letters that ARE in the word
- N is fixed in the 4th position (✓ appears twice).
- R is in the word and is now fixed in the 1st position (✓ from ROUND).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3 (it was (-) in both CRONY and ROUND).

So we have pattern: R _ _ N _  
We still need O somewhere, but it can only be in position 5 (since 2 and 3 are excluded and 1 and 4 are already R and N).

Remaining letters we can use (must avoid all banned letters: S,T,A,E,C,Y,U,D and may use any of the rest):
Possible consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible vowels: I (O is already placed at the end)

We need one more letter to fill position 2 or 3, and then O at the end.

So our word must be:
R (letter) (letter) N O

But we only need 5 letters, so the structure is:
R _ _ N O

Now let's try valid 5-letter words fitting R _ _ N O.

Examples:
- RHINO – H, I, N, O; fits pattern R H I N O.  
  Check constraints:  
  - R✓, N✓ in 4th, O✓ at 5th, new letters H I: allowed.  
  - No banned letters (S,T,A,E,C,Y,U,D).  
  This seems valid.

Another candidate: RIPNO – not a valid English word.  
Another: RIFNO – not valid.  
Another: RUMNO – not valid.  
Another: REBON – E banned.  
Another: ROBON – O in position 2 (conflict, must be 5).

So RHINO appears to be the only valid common word that fits.
