For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English five-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Has no repeating letters
2. Contains several common consonants and vowels
3. Is a valid English word

Popular starting choices include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E - similar coverage)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E - good consonant coverage)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 2)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 5)

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, but in different positions, and does NOT contain O.

I need a valid 5-letter word using A, R, S, E plus one more letter (not O). The new word must use each of A, R, S, E exactly once (since we have no duplicates in feedback), plus one new letter.

Possible letters to add: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, I want a common word. Let me think of words with these letters:

- E and A are vowels, so the fifth letter should probably be a consonant.
- Popular choices for consonant: T, N, L, D, etc.

Looking for common patterns:
- E at the end is common, e.g., ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", but E can't be at position 5.
- Words like ""REARS"" - but R is duplicated.
- ""REAPS"" - but P isn't confirmed.

After considering, ""STARE"" is a good next guess:
- Uses S, T, A, R, E - all letters we know are possible (no O)
- Moves A, R, S, E to different positions
- Introduces T which is a common letter to test

So the structure is:
S [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?]

   - We still need one more letter (since we have 5 letters total, and only 4 confirmed so far: A, R, S, E).

So the structure is:
S [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?]

But we must use each of A, R, E exactly once in the remaining four positions (positions 2-5). The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t tested yet (and not O or T). Popular untested common consonants: N, L, D, C, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that start with S and contain A, R, E with one new letter:

- SNARE: S, N, A, R, E → uses N as the new letter. 
- SEDAR: not a common word
- SANER: same letters as SNARE but E at position 4, R at position 5
- SERAC: uses C but E is at position 2, R at position 3, C at position 5
- SHARE: uses H but we haven’t tested H yet

SNARE seems best because:
- Starts with S (confirmed ✓ at position 1)
- Uses N (new letter, common)
- Rearranges A, R, E to new positions
- Is a valid English word

From the three clues so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ A, R, S, E are somewhere in the word; O is out.

2. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ S is fixed at position 1; T is out.

3. SNARE → S(✓) N(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ N is out; A, R, E are still “in wrong places”.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Contains exactly the letters S, A, R, E plus one new consonant (must be common and not O, T, N).
- The three letters A, R, E must occupy positions 2-5.

The remaining common consonants we have not used are L, D, C, H, M, B, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A, R, E, and one of those unused consonants.

Looking at typical English patterns, the consonant most often paired with S-A-R-E is L, forming “S L A R E / S A R E L / etc.”  
The only valid word that fits is:

S A R E L → invalid (no such word)  
S L A R E → invalid  
S A L E R → invalid  
S L E A R → invalid  
S E A R L → invalid  
S R E A L → invalid  

But “SABLE” is valid, yet it would repeat B and not use R/E.  
“SCARE” uses C and re-uses S (already fixed), so it’s fine:  
C is new, and A, R, E move to positions 2-5.

But let’s check positions:
S(1) C(2) A(3) R(4) E(5) → SCARE.

Positions tried so far:
- A has been in positions 1, 3  
- R has been in positions 2, 4  
- E has been in positions 4, 5  

SCARE would put:
- A in position 3 (never tried here)  
- R in position 4 (was already here in STARE, but feedback said “wrong position” – still allowed to revisit)  
- E in position 5 (was here in STARE – again allowed)  

So SCARE is legal and maximally informative.

Another candidate is SHARE (new letter H), but we have never tested H and it’s slightly less common.  
The simplest common word using a new consonant is SCARE.

Therefore, I will guess:

SCARE

The most common letters in English five-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Has no repeating letters
2. Contains several common consonants and vowels
3. Is a valid English word

Popular starting choices include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E - similar coverage)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E - good consonant coverage)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 2)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 5)

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, but in different positions, and does NOT contain O.

I need a valid 5-letter word using A, R, S, E plus one more letter (not O). The new word must use each of A, R, S, E exactly once (since we have no duplicates in feedback), plus one new letter.

Possible letters to add: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, I want a common word. Let me think of words with these letters:

- E and A are vowels, so the fifth letter should probably be a consonant.
- Popular choices for consonant: T, N, L, D, etc.

Looking for common patterns:
- E at the end is common, e.g., ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", but E can't be at position 5.
- Words like ""REARS"" - but R is duplicated.
- ""REAPS"" - but P isn't confirmed.

After considering, ""STARE"" is a good next guess:
- Uses S, T, A, R, E - all letters we know are possible (no O)
- Moves A, R, S, E to different positions
- Introduces T which is a common letter to test

Interpretation:

1. Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, E
2. Letter known NOT to be in the word: O, T
3. From STARE’s feedback:
   - S is in the correct position (position 1). So the word is:
     S _ _ _ _
   - A, R, E are in the word but must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (and not in their original spots from AROSE/STARE).
   - We still need one more letter (since we have 5 letters total, and only 4 confirmed so far: A, R, S, E).

So the structure is:
S [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?]

But we must use each of A, R, E exactly once in the remaining four positions (positions 2-5). The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t tested yet (and not O or T). Popular untested common consonants: N, L, D, C, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that start with S and contain A, R, E with one new letter:

- SNARE: S, N, A, R, E → uses N as the new letter. 
- SEDAR: not a common word
- SANER: same letters as SNARE but E at position 4, R at position 5
- SERAC: uses C but E is at position 2, R at position 3, C at position 5
- SHARE: uses H but we haven’t tested H yet

SNARE seems best because:
- Starts with S (confirmed ✓ at position 1)
- Uses N (new letter, common)
- Rearranges A, R, E to new positions
- Is a valid English word

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English five-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Has no repeating letters
2. Contains several common consonants and vowels
3. Is a valid English word

Popular starting choices include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E - similar coverage)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E - good consonant coverage)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 1)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 2)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 5)

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, but in different positions, and does NOT contain O.

I need a valid 5-letter word using A, R, S, E plus one more letter (not O). The new word must use each of A, R, S, E exactly once (since we have no duplicates in feedback), plus one new letter.

Possible letters to add: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, I want a common word. Let me think of words with these letters:

- E and A are vowels, so the fifth letter should probably be a consonant.
- Popular choices for consonant: T, N, L, D, etc.

Looking for common patterns:
- E at the end is common, e.g., ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", but E can't be at position 5.
- Words like ""REARS"" - but R is duplicated.
- ""REAPS"" - but P isn't confirmed.

After considering, ""STARE"" is a good next guess:
- Uses S, T, A, R, E - all letters we know are possible (no O)
- Moves A, R, S, E to different positions
- Introduces T which is a common letter to test

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
2. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)

Interpretation:

1. Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, E
2. Letter known NOT to be in the word: O, T
3. From STARE’s feedback:
   - S is in the correct position (position 1). So the word is:
     S _ _ _ _
   - A, R, E are in the word but must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (and not in their original spots from AROSE/STARE).
   - We still need one more letter (since we have 5 letters total, and only 4 confirmed so far: A, R, S, E).

So the structure is:
S [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?] [A/R/E/?]

But we must use each of A, R, E exactly once in the remaining four positions (positions 2-5). The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t tested yet (and not O or T). Popular untested common consonants: N, L, D, C, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that start with S and contain A, R, E with one new letter:

- SNARE: S, N, A, R, E → uses N as the new letter. 
- SEDAR: not a common word
- SANER: same letters as SNARE but E at position 4, R at position 5
- SERAC: uses C but E is at position 2, R at position 3, C at position 5
- SHARE: uses H but we haven’t tested H yet

SNARE seems best because:
- Starts with S (confirmed ✓ at position 1)
- Uses N (new letter, common)
- Rearranges A, R, E to new positions
- Is a valid English word

<guess>SNARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: SNARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three clues so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ A, R, S, E are somewhere in the word; O is out.

2. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ S is fixed at position 1; T is out.

3. SNARE → S(✓) N(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ N is out; A, R, E are still “in wrong places”.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Contains exactly the letters S, A, R, E plus one new consonant (must be common and not O, T, N).
- The three letters A, R, E must occupy positions 2-5.

The remaining common consonants we have not used are L, D, C, H, M, B, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A, R, E, and one of those unused consonants.

Looking at typical English patterns, the consonant most often paired with S-A-R-E is L, forming “S L A R E / S A R E L / etc.”  
The only valid word that fits is:

S A R E L → invalid (no such word)  
S L A R E → invalid  
S A L E R → invalid  
S L E A R → invalid  
S E A R L → invalid  
S R E A L → invalid  

But “SABLE” is valid, yet it would repeat B and not use R/E.  
“SCARE” uses C and re-uses S (already fixed), so it’s fine:  
C is new, and A, R, E move to positions 2-5.

But let’s check positions:
S(1) C(2) A(3) R(4) E(5) → SCARE.

Positions tried so far:
- A has been in positions 1, 3  
- R has been in positions 2, 4  
- E has been in positions 4, 5  

SCARE would put:
- A in position 3 (never tried here)  
- R in position 4 (was already here in STARE, but feedback said “wrong position” – still allowed to revisit)  
- E in position 5 (was here in STARE – again allowed)  

So SCARE is legal and maximally informative.

Another candidate is SHARE (new letter H), but we have never tested H and it’s slightly less common.  
The simplest common word using a new consonant is SCARE.

Therefore, I will guess:

SCARE

What we know so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. The letters A, R, E are somewhere in the remaining four positions (2, 3, 4, 5), but never in the positions we have already tested for them:
   - A has appeared in positions 1, 3 → must be in 2, 4 or 5.
   - R has appeared in positions 2, 4 → must be in 3 or 5.
   - E has appeared in positions 4, 5 → must be in 2 or 3.
3. We also need one new consonant.  Letters already excluded: O, T, N, C, H.
   Remaining common single-letter choices: L, D, B, G, M, P, etc.
4. The word must use each of A, R, E exactly once in the remaining four slots, and the new consonant exactly once.

Combining these restrictions, the four unknown positions (2-5) must contain A, R, E and one new consonant, arranged so that:
   - A ∉ {1, 3}
   - R ∉ {2, 4}
   - E ∉ {4, 5}

Let’s list every possible assignment of A, R, E to positions 2-5 that obeys the positional bans, then fill the remaining slot with a consonant that has not yet been tried.

Positions 2-5: four slots, letters {A, R, E, X} where X is a new consonant.

Possible placements for A, R, E:

- If A is in position 2:
   – R can’t be in 2 or 4 → R must be 3 or 5, but 5 is still allowed.
   – E can’t be in 4 or 5 → E must be 3.
   So:
        A(2) E(3) R(5) X(4) → S A E X R
        A(2) R(3) E(?) impossible because E can’t be in 4 or 5.  Rejected.

- If A is in position 4:
   – R can’t be 2 or 4 → R must be 3 or 5.
   – E can’t be 4 or 5 → E must be 2 or 3.
   Possibilities:
        A(4) R(3) E(2) X(5) → S E R A X
        A(4) R(5) E(2) X(3) → S E X A R
        A(4) E(2) R(5) X(3) → S E X A R (same as previous)
        A(4) E(3) R(5) X(2) → S X E A R

- If A is in position 5:
   – R can’t be 2 or 4 → R must be 3.
   – E can’t be 4 or 5 → E must be 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by R → E must be 2.
   So:
        A(5) E(2) R(3) X(4) → S E R X A

Looking for common English words fitting these patterns:

- S A E X R → SAER_?  No common words.
- S E R A X → SERAX?  No common word.
- S E X A R → SEXAR?  No common word.
- S X E A R → SXEAR?  No common word.
- S E R X A → SER_A?  SERMA, SERBA, SERDA, SERLA, SERPA, etc.  The only common 5-letter words starting with SER are SERVE, SERRY, SERGE, SERAL.  SERAL contains A in position 4 and E in position 2, R in position 3, and L in position 5.  That matches the pattern we need: S E R L A.

SERAL is actually a valid English word (relating to serums).  But let’s check if L has been excluded yet.  We have not used L in any guess, and L is common.

So SERAL fits:
   S(1) E(2) R(3) A(4) L(5)

All positional restrictions respected:
   A is in 4 (never before), R in 3 (never before), E in 2 (never before), and L is new.

Therefore the next guess is SERAL.
