- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common English letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- All distinct letters

From the feedback for SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word, but not in position 2
- A (✓) – correct in position 3
- T (-) – in the word, but not in position 4
- E (x) – not in the word

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, E
- Letters in the word but position unknown: L, T
- Letter locked in position 3: A

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 3
2. Contains both L and T (somewhere other than positions 2 and 4 respectively)

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1, 2, 5)

Let's brainstorm candidates:
- PLANT: A in 3, L in 2 (forbidden), T in 5 – invalid (L can't be in 2)
- ALTAR: A in 3, L in 1, T in 4 (forbidden) – invalid (T can't be in 4)
- FATAL: A in 3, L in 4 or 5 – T is in 2 – this could work
- TALON: A in 3, L in 2 (forbidden) – invalid
- LATTE: has E (forbidden) – invalid

Let's digest the new feedback.

Guess 2: FATAL  
Feedback: F(x) A(-) T(-) A(-) L(✓)

Interpretation:
- F is not in the word (x).
- First A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- Second A is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- L is in the word and IS in position 5 (✓).

So now we know:
1. Word pattern: _ _ A _ L
2. Letters definitely in: A, T, L  
   – A must appear somewhere other than 2, 4. (It’s already locked in 3, so this is satisfied.)
   – T must appear somewhere other than 3 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, 5 (but 5 is L), so 1 or 2.
3. Letters definitely out: S, E, F.
4. We still need one more letter (since we’ve placed A, T, L).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- If T is in position 1: T _ A _ L
- If T is in position 2: _ T A _ L

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits either T _ A _ L or _ T A _ L, using only letters we haven’t ruled out (no S, E, F).

Possible candidates:
- T _ A _ L: TRAIL (but has I, R allowed) – check letters: T, R, A, I, L – all allowed.  
- _ T A _ L: METAL (has E – out), TOTAL (O allowed, T again – duplicate T), AT ALL (invalid), DITAL (valid? Dictionary says “dital” is obsolete for thimble, but 5-letter), DATAL (not a word), PATEL (E out), RATAL (E out).

TRAIL fits T _ A _ L: T R A I L → letters used: T, R, A, I, L. All allowed.

Another quick check against constraints:
- No S, E, F – OK  
- L is in 5 – OK  
- A is in 3 – OK  
- T is in 1 – OK  
- R and I not yet ruled out – OK

So TRAIL looks perfect.
