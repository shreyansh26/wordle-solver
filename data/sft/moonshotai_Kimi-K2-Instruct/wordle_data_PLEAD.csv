- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is my first guess and I have no previous feedback to work with, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include both vowels and consonants
4. Be a valid English word

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess that uses several of these would be ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), and all letters are different.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include both vowels and consonants
4. Be a valid English word

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess that uses several of these would be ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), and all letters are different.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all

- E(-): E is in the word but in wrong position (not 5th)

So the secret word contains:
- A (but not at position 1)
- E (but not at position 5)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S
- We need 3 more letters (from 5-letter word total)

Good letters to test next: common unused consonants like T, L, N, C, D, etc. and remaining vowels like I, U. Since A and E must appear, and we know their positions aren't 1st and 5th respectively, possible positions for A and E are 2-5 for A and 1-4 for E.

We now know:

- Exact pattern: _ L E A _
- Letters definitely in the word: L, E, A (at positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
- Letters already eliminated: R, O, S, T, C, N, B, K, G, M

So the first and fifth positions must be filled with letters that:
- Have not yet been tried
- Appear in valid English words that match ? L E A ?

Remaining unused consonants:
D, F, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a single consonant for position 1 and a single consonant for position 5 that together make a real word.

Common 5-letter words fitting ? L E A ?:
- F L E A D
- H L E A P   (invalid)
- D L E A P   (invalid)
- P L E A D
- S L E A P   (S eliminated)
- F L E A T   (T eliminated)
- H L E A D   (invalid)

The only valid, common word left is PLEAD (P in position 1, D in position 5).

Both P and D are still allowed.  
Therefore PLEAD satisfies all constraints and should be the correct word.
