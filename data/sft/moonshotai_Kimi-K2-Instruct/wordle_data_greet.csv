For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically contain common letters and cover a good distribution of vowels and consonants. Classic optimal first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - good mix of vowels and common consonants
- ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covers very common letters
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E - excellent coverage

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes some of the most frequent letters in English (S, T, A, E, L) and should provide good initial information regardless of the actual word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S and L are NOT in the word (x).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 5).

So the mystery word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A.
- Contains both T and E, but T is not in slot 4 and E is not in slot 5.

When choosing the next guess I want to:
1. Re-use T and E, but in different positions.
2. Avoid S, L, A entirely.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good letters to try now are R, N, I, C, H, O, U, etc. I’ll place T and E in new spots and fill the remaining slots with fresh, common letters.

A strong candidate that meets these criteria is “TREND”:
- T moves from slot 4 to slot 1.
- E moves from slot 5 to slot 2.
- Adds R, N, D (all high-frequency consonants not yet tested).
- Avoids S, L, A.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have a very clear picture of the hidden word:

Known facts  
- Position 2 = R (✓)  
- Position 3 = E (✓)  
- Position 5 = T (✓)  

Letters confirmed absent (x): S, L, A, N, D, C, P  
Letters still possibly present: any others, but only one slot (position 1) needs a new letter.  
Position 4 must be one of the letters we have not yet tried and that does not appear in the “absent” list.

So the skeleton is:  
_  R  E  _  T  

For position 1 and 4 we need two distinct, still-available letters.  
Common letters not yet ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter English word of the form **X R E Y T** (or **X R E _ T**).

Let’s try **GREET** – it fits:
- G (new) in position 1  
- R (fixed) in 2  
- E (fixed) in 3  
- E (already okay) in 4  
- T (fixed) in 5  

All letters are allowed and it forms a real English word.
