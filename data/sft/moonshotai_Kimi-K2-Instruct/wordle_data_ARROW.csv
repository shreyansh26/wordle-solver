1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good starting word should use frequently occurring letters in English. Common choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains very common letters: A, R, O, S, E
- These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
- The letters are in varied positions, which helps with placement information

From the feedback:
A (✓) – correct, first letter is A  
R (✓) – correct, second letter is R  
O (-) – O is in the word but not in third position  
S (x) – S is not in the word at all  
E (x) – E is not in the word at all  

So far we know:
Pattern: A R _ _ _
Letters to keep: A, R, O
Letters to avoid: S, E
Positions to avoid for O: 3rd spot

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “AR” and contains an O somewhere after position 2 (since it can’t be 3rd). Common letters left to try: T, N, L, C, H, I, D, M, Y, etc.

Good candidates: ARBOR, ARGON, ARMOR, AROMA, ARROW, ARSON, ARTIC, ARTLY, etc.

The clearest next step is to test whether O belongs in position 4. A strong word for that is “ARGON” (A-R-G-O-N) because:
- Keeps A in 1st and R in 2nd
- Places O in 4th (new position)
- Introduces G and N to see if they’re in the word without repeating S or E

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Word begins with A R _ _ _
   - O is present but not in position 3.

2. ARGON → A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) N(x)
   - Word begins with A R _ O _
   - O must therefore be in position 4 (since it was “wrong position” in AROSE and now is ✓ in ARGON).

So the pattern is A R _ O _ and the remaining letters must avoid S, E, G, N.

Remaining common consonants / vowels we haven’t tried: T, L, C, H, I, D, M, Y, etc.

Candidate words fitting A R _ O _ :  
- AROMA (but uses A twice, which is allowed but we already know A is fixed)  
- ARGOT – but G is already ruled out  
- ARMOR – but R is already fixed in position 2, and O is fixed in 4  
- AROSE – already used  
- ARTIC – doesn’t fit pattern  
- ARBOR – B hasn’t been tested yet

Actually, let’s list all legal 5-letter English words that start with AR and have O in position 4:

- ARBOL (Spanish loan, rarely in Scrabble lists)  
- ARDOR  
- ARMOR  
- ARGOT  
- ARROW  

Of these, ARROW is most common, introduces W (new letter) and keeps everything otherwise consistent.

So next guess = ARROW.
