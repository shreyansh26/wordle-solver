As this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice among Wordle players because it includes:

- S: a very common consonant
- L: another common consonant
- A: the most common vowel
- T: a very common consonant
- E: the second most common vowel

This combination should help reveal several letters or their positions in the secret word.

From the three rounds of feedback:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
S, A, T, E, F, U, K, R, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- C (position 1: ✓) – fixed in 1st spot  
- L (somewhere, but not positions 2 or 3) – so positions 1, 4, 5 remaining; 1 is already C, so L must be in 4 or 5  
- O (somewhere, but not position 3) – positions 1, 2, 4, 5 remaining; 1 is C, so positions 2, 4, 5  
- N (somewhere, but not positions 3 or 4) – positions 1, 2, 5 remaining; 1 is C, so positions 2 or 5  

Pattern so far:  
C _ _ _ _  

We need to place L, O, N (and one extra letter) while respecting the positional constraints.  

Possible positions:  
- L must be in 4 or 5  
- N must be in 2 or 5  
- O must be in 2, 4, or 5  

We also have not yet tested the vowels I or the consonants D, G, M, P, V, etc.  

Let’s try to place N in 2 and L in 4, then O must go in 5. The word would end up as C N _ L O. We need a valid 5-letter word with this pattern.  

Looking at the dictionary, “CN?LO” doesn’t yield common words. Let’s instead try N in 2 and L in 5, with O in 4: C N _ O L. Again, no common word matches.  

Next possibility: N in 5 and L in 4, then O must be in 2: C O _ L N. A valid word that fits is “COLIN” (a common male name and a valid Scrabble/Wordle word).  

- Letters used: C, O, L, I, N – none of these have been ruled out.  
- C is fixed in position 1 (✓).  
- O placed in position 2 (new position to test).  
- L placed in position 4 (allowed).  
- N placed in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is a new vowel we haven’t tested yet.  

This seems like a strong candidate.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,COLON,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>As this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice among Wordle players because it includes:

- S: a very common consonant
- L: another common consonant
- A: the most common vowel
- T: a very common consonant
- E: the second most common vowel

This combination should help reveal several letters or their positions in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x).
- L (2nd letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- It DOES contain L, but not in the 2nd position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L but not in the 2nd position.
2. Does not contain S, A, T, E.

Possible choices: I’ll look for a word with common remaining consonants (like R, N, D, C, M) and vowels (O, U, I). A good candidate is ""FLUNK"" because:
- Contains L (and positions it in the 3rd slot, satisfying the feedback).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters (F, L, U, N, K) to test new vowels/consonants.

Letters we know ARE in the word:

So L and N must appear somewhere else in the five-letter word.  
Remaining positions for L: 1, 4, 5  
Remaining positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We still need three more letters. We have not yet tested the vowels I, O, or the consonants R, M, C, D, G, etc.

A good “test-all” word with common untested letters is “CRONY”:
- C, R, O, N, Y  
- Includes N (allowed in position 4 or 1) and does not repeat any ruled-out letters.  
- Also tests new vowel O and common consonants C, R, Y.

Let’s use CRONY.
