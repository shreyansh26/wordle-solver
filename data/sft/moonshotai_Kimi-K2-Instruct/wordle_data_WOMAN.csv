For the first guess, there's no prior feedback, so we want a word that includes common letters to maximize the information we get. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). One of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (vowel)
- T (common)
- E (very common vowel)
This should give us a broad range of feedback to work with for subsequent guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

We now know the word:
- Contains the letter A, but not at position 3.
- Definitely does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

So we want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Current information:
- Letters OUT: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, C
- Letters IN the word (but positions unknown): A, O, N
- Exact position known: N is the 5th letter (✓)
- Ruled-out positions:
  – A: NOT position 3 (from SLATE) or 2 (from MACON) → A can be 1, 4
  – O: NOT position 5 (from RADIO) or 4 (from MACON) → O can be 1, 2, 3

So the pattern looks like:
_ _ _ _ N
with A and O somewhere in the first four spots, each exactly once.

Re-using the letters already confirmed eliminates duplicates of A or O, and we must avoid all the excluded letters.

Candidate constraints:
- Only letters allowed: A, O, N + any unused consonants/vowels not on the “out” list (remaining common: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Need 2 more letters from the allowed set to fill the two remaining positions.

Let’s find a 5-letter English word that fits:
- ends in N
- uses A and O exactly once each
- only uses yet-untried letters

Real words satisfying:
- BACON — but C is banned.
- GAMON — but M and A positions clash (A already ruled out at position 2).
- JAMON — J, A, M, O, N: M already tested and only marked “-”, but we can still reuse it; but A still can’t be in position 2.
- Among realistic: “GAMON” is the closest but A can’t be in position 2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). One of the most common starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (vowel)
- T (common)
- E (very common vowel)
This should give us a broad range of feedback to work with for subsequent guesses.

Goal: pick a 5-letter word that:

Guess 3: MACON -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) C(x) O(-) N(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Letters OUT: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, C
- Letters IN the word (but positions unknown): A, O, N
- Exact position known: N is the 5th letter (✓)
- Ruled-out positions:
  – A: NOT position 3 (from SLATE) or 2 (from MACON) → A can be 1, 4
  – O: NOT position 5 (from RADIO) or 4 (from MACON) → O can be 1, 2, 3

So the pattern looks like:
_ _ _ _ N
with A and O somewhere in the first four spots, each exactly once.

Re-using the letters already confirmed eliminates duplicates of A or O, and we must avoid all the excluded letters.

Candidate constraints:
- Only letters allowed: A, O, N + any unused consonants/vowels not on the “out” list (remaining common: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Need 2 more letters from the allowed set to fill the two remaining positions.

Let’s find a 5-letter English word that fits:
- ends in N
- uses A and O exactly once each
- only uses yet-untried letters

Examples to check:
- “APO-N” – APOXN not a word
- “ABO-N” – ABOXN not a word
- “AHO-N” – AHOXN not a word
- “B” + “O” + “A” + “N” → BOA-N → BOANN invalid length
- “G” + “O” + “A” + “N” → GOA-N → GOANX not a word
- “HA” + “O” + “N” → HOA-N → HOAXN not a word
- “PA” + “O” + “N” → PAONN invalid
- “YA” + “O” + “N” → YAONN invalid
- “GA” + “O” + “N” → GAONN invalid
Let’s use a dictionary check for 5-letter words ending in N, containing A and O once each, no banned letters.

Real words satisfying:
- BACON — but C is banned.
- GAMON — but M and A positions clash (A already ruled out at position 2).
- JAMON — J, A, M, O, N: M already tested and only marked “-”, but we can still reuse it; but A still can’t be in position 2.
- Among realistic: “GAMON” is the closest but A can’t be in position 2.
- Next: “GOBAN” — uses B, which is allowed; A in 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), ends in N (5). Checks all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: GOBAN.

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, C, G, B  
2. Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - A is in position 4 (✓)
   - N is in position 5 (✓)
3. So the known pattern is: _ O _ A N
4. We still need two letters for positions 1 and 3.  
   Allowed letters (not yet excluded): F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-used-but-unguessed-in-those-spots M, etc.  
   But we already saw M gave only “-” in position 1 (MACON), so it is not in the word.  
   Common remaining consonants: H, K, P, U (sometimes vowel), Y, etc.

We need a valid English 5-letter word of the form * O * A N, using only the allowed letters.

Some candidates:
- H O W A N → “H O W A N” not a word
- H O K A N → not a word
- P O K A N → not a word
- J O K A N → not a word
- F O A M N → invalid pattern
- Y O G A N → but G excluded
- H O P A N → not a word
- M O A N N → invalid and M excluded
- Y O J A N → not a word
- K O P A N → not a word
- P O Y A N → not a word
- M O V A N → not a word
- H O Y A N → not a word
- H O M A N → M excluded

Real dictionary check: only “HOGAN” pops up, but G is excluded.  
Next possible word: “KOBAN” – but K,O,B,A,N – B excluded.  
Next: “JOHAN” – but J,O,H,A,N – H and J still allowed.  
Check “JOHAN” – that’s a plausible name/variant, but is it a Wordle-eligible word? Wordle accepts common names like “ABBEY”, so it’s worth a try.

But let’s cross-check for another: “POWAN” – P,O,W,A,N – P, W still allowed. “powan” is indeed a real word (a type of fish).

So the two most promising legal 5-letter words fitting the pattern and constraints are:
- JOHAN
- POWAN

Between these, “POWAN” uses P and W (both still allowed) and is an English word meaning a whitefish.

Therefore, we’ll guess POWAN.

Summary of facts after 5 guesses:

Known pattern: _ O _ A N  (positions 2 = O, 4 = A, 5 = N)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, C, G, B, P

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3:  
Any letter not in the excluded list and not already shown to be elsewhere.  
Among consonants, useful remaining letters: F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(We have already tried M and W; they produced “-” feedback, so they are also out.)

Therefore, positions 1 and 3 can only be chosen from: F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter English word that fits the pattern _ O _ A N and uses only the remaining alphabet.

Possible English words fitting _ O _ A N:

1. H O J A N – not a standard word.
2. H O K A N – not a standard word.
3. J O H A N – this is a valid proper noun / given name (e.g., “Johan”), and Wordle/Word games do accept common proper nouns as valid entries.
4. Y O K A N – not standard.
5. Z O H A N – not standard.

“JOHAN” is the only remaining valid word that satisfies every constraint.

Hence the next (and final) logical guess is JOHAN.
