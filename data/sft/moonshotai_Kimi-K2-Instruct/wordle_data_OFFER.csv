For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words among Wordle players include:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers very common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - also common letters
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - focuses on vowels

Among these, SLATE seems like a strong choice because it includes three of the most common consonants (S, T, L) and two very common vowels (A, E). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Current facts:
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, N, D, Y, W, C, K.
- Letters known TO be in the word: E, R.

Positions ruled out so far:
- E is not in positions 2 (NERDY) or 3 (WRECK) or 5 (SLATE).
- R is not in positions 2 (NERDY) or 3 (WRECK).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 1 or 4.
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but R≠5 if E is in 4, because both can’t be in 4).

Allowed letters left (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden list and keeping E, R):
B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and R.
- Has E in position 1 or 4.
- Has R in an allowed position (1, 4, 5) without conflict.

Let’s list possible placements:
1. E _ _ _ R  (E in 1, R in 5)
2. E _ R _ _  (E in 1, R in 3 – but R not allowed in 3)
3. _ _ _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
4. _ _ E R _ (E in 3 – forbidden)
5. _ E _ _ R (E in 2 – forbidden)
6. R _ _ _ E (R in 1, E in 5 – E forbidden in 5)

Only two valid patterns remain:
- E _ _ _ R
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s explore pattern E _ _ _ R:
We need three middle letters from the remaining pool, and the word must be valid.

Possible candidates:
- E B O R – but needs 5 letters.
We need common 5-letter words fitting E _ _ _ R.

Checking valid 5-letter English words with letters from remaining pool:
- E V I L R – no, has L (forbidden)
- E F O R T – T is forbidden
- E B O R T – T forbidden
- E R R O R – R appears twice, but R is known to be present at least once (might be ok)
- E X P O R – not a word
- E M I R – too short
- E V I C T – C forbidden
- E V E R – too short
Let’s think systematically.

From remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

For pattern E _ _ _ R:
- E B O R – invalid length
- E M B E R – has E twice (but only one E confirmed, might be valid)
- E V I L R – L invalid
- E M I R O – not valid
Actually, EMIR is 4 letters, so not useful.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words among Wordle players include:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers very common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - also common letters
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - focuses on vowels

Among these, SLATE seems like a strong choice because it includes three of the most common consonants (S, T, L) and two very common vowels (A, E). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: not in the word at all (x)
- A: not in the word at all (x)
- T: not in the word at all (x)
- E: is somewhere in the word (-) but not in the last position

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter E (not at the end).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Next we need a new word that:
- Uses the letter E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Includes other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.).

A good candidate word: ""CHORE""  
- C, H, O, R, E – none of these are S, L, A, T.
- E is in the 5th position (but the feedback says E is not at the end), so that’s no good.

Next candidate: ""NERDY""  
- N, E, R, D, Y – none are S, L, A, T.
- E is in the 2nd position (allowed).
- D, N, R, Y are all high-frequency letters not yet tested.

This looks solid.

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): E, R.
3. E is not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and not in position 5 (from Guess 1).
4. R is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2).

We need a new word that:
- Contains both E and R.
- Places E somewhere other than position 2 or 5.
- Places R somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no S,L,A,T,N,D,Y).

Available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.

Good options:
- E must go in position 1, 3, or 4 (can't be 2 or 5).
- R must avoid position 3.

Let's try ""FROZE"":
- F, R, O, Z, E
- Contains E (position 5 - but we know E can't be at end) → invalid.

Try ""CREEP"":
- C, R, E, E, P
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- But has double E which might not be optimal.

Try ""REBUS"":
- R, E, B, U, S
- Contains S (invalid).

Try ""GRIPE"":

- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Try ""PERCH"":

- Contains N (invalid).

Try ""WRECK"":
- W, R, E, C, K
- E in position 3 (allowed)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,OFFER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words among Wordle players include:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers very common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - also common letters
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - focuses on vowels

Among these, SLATE seems like a strong choice because it includes three of the most common consonants (S, T, L) and two very common vowels (A, E). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: not in the word at all (x)
- A: not in the word at all (x)
- T: not in the word at all (x)
- E: is somewhere in the word (-) but not in the last position

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter E (not at the end).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Next we need a new word that:
- Uses the letter E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Includes other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.).

A good candidate word: ""CHORE""  
- C, H, O, R, E – none of these are S, L, A, T.
- E is in the 5th position (but the feedback says E is not at the end), so that’s no good.

Next candidate: ""NERDY""  
- N, E, R, D, Y – none are S, L, A, T.
- E is in the 2nd position (allowed).
- D, N, R, Y are all high-frequency letters not yet tested.

This looks solid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
1. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, N, D, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): E, R.
3. E is not in position 2 (from Guess 2) and not in position 5 (from Guess 1).
4. R is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2).

We need a new word that:
- Contains both E and R.
- Places E somewhere other than position 2 or 5.
- Places R somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no S,L,A,T,N,D,Y).

Available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Z, etc.

Good options:
- E must go in position 1, 3, or 4 (can't be 2 or 5).
- R must avoid position 3.

Let's try ""FROZE"":
- F, R, O, Z, E
- Contains E (position 5 - but we know E can't be at end) → invalid.

Try ""CREEP"":
- C, R, E, E, P
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- But has double E which might not be optimal.

Try ""REBUS"":
- R, E, B, U, S
- Contains S (invalid).

Try ""GRIPE"":
- G, R, I, P, E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Try ""PERCH"":
- P, E, R, C, H
- E in position 2 (invalid from feedback).

Try ""HERON"":
- H, E, R, O, N
- Contains N (invalid).

Try ""WRECK"":
- W, R, E, C, K
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.

This seems good - contains E and R in allowed positions, uses new letters W, C, K.

- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, N, D, Y, W, C, K.
- Letters known TO be in the word: E, R.

Positions ruled out so far:
- E is not in positions 2 (NERDY) or 3 (WRECK) or 5 (SLATE).
- R is not in positions 2 (NERDY) or 3 (WRECK).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 1 or 4.
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but R≠5 if E is in 4, because both can’t be in 4).

Allowed letters left (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden list and keeping E, R):
B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and R.
- Has E in position 1 or 4.
- Has R in an allowed position (1, 4, 5) without conflict.

Let’s list possible placements:
1. E _ _ _ R  (E in 1, R in 5)
2. E _ R _ _  (E in 1, R in 3 – but R not allowed in 3)
3. _ _ _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
4. _ _ E R _ (E in 3 – forbidden)
5. _ E _ _ R (E in 2 – forbidden)
6. R _ _ _ E (R in 1, E in 5 – E forbidden in 5)

Only two valid patterns remain:
- E _ _ _ R
- _ _ _ E R

Let’s explore pattern E _ _ _ R:
We need three middle letters from the remaining pool, and the word must be valid.

Possible candidates:
- E B O R – but needs 5 letters.
We need common 5-letter words fitting E _ _ _ R.

Checking valid 5-letter English words with letters from remaining pool:
- E V I L R – no, has L (forbidden)
- E F O R T – T is forbidden
- E B O R T – T forbidden
- E R R O R – R appears twice, but R is known to be present at least once (might be ok)
- E X P O R – not a word
- E M I R – too short
- E V I C T – C forbidden
- E V E R – too short
Let’s think systematically.

From remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

For pattern E _ _ _ R:
- E B O R – invalid length
- E M B E R – has E twice (but only one E confirmed, might be valid)
- E V I L R – L invalid
- E M I R O – not valid
Actually, EMIR is 4 letters, so not useful.

Let’s try pattern _ _ _ E R:
We need positions 1,2,3 from remaining letters, and 4=E, 5=R.

Possible candidates:
- G I V E R – G, I, V, E, R. All allowed letters. ""GIVER"" is a valid English word.
- F I V E R – F, I, V, E, R. ""FIVER"" is also valid (slang for five-dollar bill).
- H O P E R – H, O, P, E, R. ""HOPER"" is valid.
- B O X E R – B, O, X, E, R. ""BOXER"" is valid.
- F O G E R – not a common word.
- P I V E R – not a word.
- V I B E R – not a word.

Among these, GIVER, HOPER, BOXER, FIVER seem good.
Let’s pick ""HOPER"" – common letters, and H,O,P not yet tested.

But wait, ""HOPER"" uses H,O,P,E,R – none are forbidden. Let’s check:
- H not in forbidden list.
- O not in forbidden list.
- P not in forbidden list.
- E is in word.
- R is in word.
Positions:
- E in 4 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- H,O,P in 1,2,3 – all new letters.

This looks like the best next guess.
