For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first guess balances vowels and consonants to test multiple common letters. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This allows testing of five unique and frequent letters right away, which helps quickly narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly well-balanced and widely recognized as a strong opener.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains R somewhere other than position 2.
2. It does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, etc. and remaining vowels include I and U. Since we have no info yet on vowels, we should try to include one or both of I and U.

Let’s pick a word that uses R plus common remaining letters. A good choice might be ""TRIUM"" but that’s not common. A more common word like ""DRUID"" uses D, R, U, I, but R is in position 2, which we know is wrong. Next option: ""FRUIT"" – contains R (position 2 again, invalid). ""CURVE"" – has E (invalid). ""PRICK"" – has C and I and K (good letters), and R is in position 1 (allowed). This seems good.

Thus, ""PRICK"" is a valid word that:
- Contains R (position 1, not 2 – OK).
- Does not contain A, O, S, or E.
- Tests new letters P, I, C, K.

This should help narrow down further.

Current information:

Letters known to be in the word (somewhere, not necessarily in the positions tried):
- R (but NOT in position 2)
- I (but NOT in position 3)
- C (and it IS in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, P, K.

Word skeleton so far: _ _ _ C _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has C in position 4.
- Contains both R and I somewhere except R ≠ pos 2 and I ≠ pos 3.
- Avoids all banned letters: A, O, S, E, P, K.

Possible letters left (common ones): D, T, N, L, G, B, U, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words ending in _ _ _ C _:

- BRICK (uses K – banned)
- TRICK (uses K – banned)
- DRIFT (doesn’t fit C in position 4)
- C is fixed at position 4, so we need words like _ _ _ C _

Let me think of words with C in position 4:
- DRUID (C not at 4)
- CURVE (E banned)
- CIRCA (A banned)
- …

Actually, let me scan for words with C in position 4, and containing R and I, avoiding banned letters.

One such word is “TRICE” – but E is banned.

Another: “CRIMP” – P is banned.

“CRIBS” – S is banned.

“DRILY” – but C isn’t there.

Wait, let me re-examine: we need C in position 4, and the word must contain R and I, without banned letters.

A valid candidate: “DIRTY” – but C isn’t there.

Ah! Let me list possible words:

- _ _ _ C _ with C at 4.

Let me try “FRUIT” – C isn’t there.

Wait, let me systematically list:

We have three letters to place: positions 1, 2, 3, and 5. C is fixed at 4.

We know R must be in the word, not at position 2.

I must be in the word, not at position 3.

So possible positions:

R could be at 1, 3, or 5.
I could be at 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3).

They can’t both be at 5, so they must be in 1 and 2 or 3 and 2 or etc.

Let’s try a word like “BRIDE” – E banned.

“DRIFT” – C not at 4.

“CRISP” – P banned.

“TRUCE” – E banned.

“DRUID” – C not at 4.

I think I need to list possible words with C at 4, containing R and I, avoiding banned letters.

One such word is “CURIO” – O banned.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think differently: possible letters left are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word with:
- C at position 4
- must contain R and I
- R not at 2
- I not at 3
- no A, O, S, E, P, K

A good candidate is “D R I C T” – but that’s not a word.

“B R I C H” – not a word.

“B R I C K” – K banned.

“C R I C K” – K banned.

“G R I C T” – not a word.

“T R I C K” – K banned.

“C R I C H” – not a word.

“F R I C T” – not a word.

Wait, let me think of words ending in ...C? Actually, C is at 4, so ending letter is 5.

We need words like _ _ _ C _ with C at 4.

Let me think: B R I C _ – but then 5th letter must be valid.

“BRICK” – K banned.

“CRICK” – K banned.

“PRICK” – already tried.

“FRICK” – K banned.

“TRICK” – K banned.

Hmm, seems like many common ones use K. Let me try others.

“DRYIC” – not a word.

“CHIRP” – C not at 4.

“RIGHT” – C not at 4.

I think I need to find words with C at 4, not using banned letters.

Wait, let me try “DIRTY” – no.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with C at 4, then filter.

Examples:
- TRUCE – E banned
- CURVE – E banned
- CIRCA – A banned
- CURIO – O banned
- TRICE – E banned
- CRICK – K banned

Hmm, seems hard. Maybe “CRIMP” – P banned.

“CURDY” – not common.

“BURIN” – C not at 4.

Wait, let me try “D R I C _”:

“DRICE” – not a word.

“DRICK” – K banned.

“DRILY” – C not at 4.

This is tricky. Let me try “GRIME” – E banned.

“GRIFT” – C not at 4.

“GRIND” – C not at 4.

“GRIN” – too short.

Let me think of words with C in 4th, containing R and I:

“CURDY” – no.

“BURIN” – no.

“LURID” – C not at 4.

“FURIC” – not a word.

“MURIC” – not a word.

Wait, let me try “NITRIC” – too long.

“CRIT” – too short.

I think the issue is that C at 4 is restrictive. Let me try “BRINY” – C not at 4.

“BRUIS” – S banned.

“BRUIT” – T at 5, C at 4 not there.

Wait, let me try “DRILY” – no C.

I think I need to find a word like _ I _ C R or similar.

Let me try “BIRCH” – C at 4, H at 5, B at 1, I at 2, R at 3.

Check constraints:
- C at 4 – yes.
- Contains R – yes (at 3).
- R not at 2 – yes (it’s at 3).
- Contains I – yes (at 2).
- I not at 3 – yes (it’s at 2).
- No banned letters: A, O, S, E, P, K – none present.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all criteria.

Thus, the next guess is BIRCH.

- R is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 2.
- I is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- Letters **not** in the word: A, O, S, E, P, K.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **BIRCH**:

- C is in position 4.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

We need to form a word with:
- C at position 4
- must contain R and I
- R not at 2
- I not at 3
- no A, O, S, E, P, K

A good candidate is “D R I C T” – but that’s not a word.

“B R I C H” – not a word.

“B R I C K” – K banned.

“C R I C K” – K banned.

“G R I C T” – not a word.

“T R I C K” – K banned.

“C R I C H” – not a word.

“F R I C T” – not a word.

Wait, let me think of words ending in ...C? Actually, C is at 4, so ending letter is 5.

We need words like _ _ _ C _ with C at 4.

Let me think: B R I C _ – but then 5th letter must be valid.

“BRICK” – K banned.

“CRICK” – K banned.

“PRICK” – already tried.

“FRICK” – K banned.

“TRICK” – K banned.

Hmm, seems like many common ones use K. Let me try others.

“DRYIC” – not a word.

“CHIRP” – C not at 4.

“RIGHT” – C not at 4.

I think I need to find words with C at 4, not using banned letters.

Wait, let me try “DIRTY” – no.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with C at 4, then filter.

Examples:
- TRUCE – E banned
- CURVE – E banned
- CIRCA – A banned
- CURIO – O banned
- TRICE – E banned
- CRICK – K banned

Hmm, seems hard. Maybe “CRIMP” – P banned.

“CURDY” – not common.

“BURIN” – C not at 4.

Wait, let me try “D R I C _”:

“DRICE” – not a word.

“DRICK” – K banned.

“DRILY” – C not at 4.

This is tricky. Let me try “GRIME” – E banned.

“GRIFT” – C not at 4.

“GRIND” – C not at 4.

“GRIN” – too short.

Let me think of words with C in 4th, containing R and I:

“CURDY” – no.

“BURIN” – no.

“LURID” – C not at 4.

“FURIC” – not a word.

“MURIC” – not a word.

Wait, let me try “NITRIC” – too long.

“CRIT” – too short.

I think the issue is that C at 4 is restrictive. Let me try “BRINY” – C not at 4.

“BRUIS” – S banned.

“BRUIT” – T at 5, C at 4 not there.

Wait, let me try “DRILY” – no C.

I think I need to find a word like _ I _ C R or similar.

Let me try “BIRCH” – C at 4, H at 5, B at 1, I at 2, R at 3.

Check constraints:
- C at 4 – yes.
- Contains R – yes (at 3).
- R not at 2 – yes (it’s at 3).
- Contains I – yes (at 2).
- I not at 3 – yes (it’s at 2).
- No banned letters: A, O, S, E, P, K – none present.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems to fit all criteria.

Thus, the next guess is BIRCH.From the prior feedback, we know:

- C is in position 4.
- R is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 2.
- I is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- Letters **not** in the word: A, O, S, E, P, K.

A word that satisfies all these constraints is **BIRCH**:
- B, I, R, C, H – none of the banned letters.
- C is in position 4.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).",Guess 3: BIRCH -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) R(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
