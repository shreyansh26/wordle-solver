Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, we should choose a strong starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters frequently found in 5-letter English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test 5 unique letters
3. Include a mix of vowels and consonants

Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - all common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (vowel-heavy)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly strong because:
- R is very common in English words
- A, I are top vowels
- S and E are extremely common letters
- It covers both beginning (R) and ending (E) positions well

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

From the first feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (R = yellow)
- A is not in the word (A = grey)
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (I = green, 3rd spot)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (S = yellow)
- E is not in the word (E = grey)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _
Known letters: R, S, I (with I locked in the 3rd spot)

Next steps:
1. Remove A and E from consideration for any position.
2. R must appear somewhere other than 1st position.
3. S must appear somewhere other than 4th position.
4. We need two more consonants (or vowels) that haven't been eliminated.

A good second guess would incorporate R and S in new positions while introducing fresh letters. ""TRIMS"" is strong because:
- T is a new common letter
- R moves to 2nd position
- I is confirmed in 3rd
- M is new and common
- S moves to 5th position

This tests R, S in new spots while adding T and M.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. After RAISE:
   - R is in word, wrong place (≠ 1st).
   - A not in word.
   - I in word and in 3rd place (✓).
   - S in word, wrong place (≠ 4th).
   - E not in word.

2. After TRIMS:
   - T not in word.
   - R is in word, wrong place (≠ 2nd).
   - I still correct at 3rd.
   - M not in word.
   - S is in word, wrong place (≠ 5th).

So far we know:
   _ _ I _ _
   Letters to use: R and S (each must appear exactly once, since they are only yellow).
   R ≠ 1st & ≠ 2nd → R must be in 4th or 5th.
   S ≠ 4th & ≠ 5th → S must be in 1st or 2nd.

That gives two possible skeletons:
   Case A: S _ I R _
   Case B: _ S I R _

We still need two fresh letters.  
Common unused consonants: N, C, L, F, G, D, P …  
Common unused vowels: O, U.

Let’s pick a word that fits Case A and introduces a couple of new high-frequency letters.  
S _ I R _ → insert N and O: SNORI is invalid, but SPOIL uses P and O (both new).  
However, L hasn’t been tested yet, and SPOIL would place S in 1st, P in 2nd, O in 4th, L in 5th.  
But that doesn’t align with the R placement.

Better: choose a word that puts S in 1st, R in 4th, and two new letters in 2nd & 5th.  
S _ I R _ → S C I R K or S L I R K. “SLIRK” isn’t a valid word, but “SCIRK” isn’t either.  
Instead, “SPARK” – but A is banned.  
“SKIRT” – fits S _ I R _, and T has already been ruled out.  
“SPIRE” – E banned.  
“SNIRK” – not common.  
“SWIRL” – L and W new, and it fits S _ I R L (R in 4th). SWIRL = S W I R L → positions:
   S (1st), W (2nd), I (3rd ✓), R (4th), L (5th).
This satisfies:
   - S used in 1st (allowed).
