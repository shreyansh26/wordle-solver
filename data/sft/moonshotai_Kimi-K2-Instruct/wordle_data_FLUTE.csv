For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters across different positions. The most effective opening words typically include a mix of common vowels and consonants. After analyzing letter frequency in English, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
This gives good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful information about which vowels and consonants appear in the secret word.

So far we know the secret word ends with the letter E (E at position 5 is ✓).  
The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.  
To maximize new information on the second guess, I want:
- a word that keeps the final E.
- several new, high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried (especially T, L, N, I, U, D, etc.).
- to avoid any of the ruled-out letters A, R, O, S.

A good candidate is “UNTIE”:  
U, N, T, I are all fresh letters, and the word ends in E.  
This should quickly reveal which, if any, of U, N, T, I appear and in what positions.

Current confirmed facts:
1. The word ends with E (position 5 is ✓).
2. Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, N, I.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (from UNTIE):
   - U is somewhere but NOT first position (U -)
   - T is somewhere but NOT third position (T -)
4. We still need to test additional high-frequency consonants and vowels, especially the remaining vowels (none used yet: Y is vowel-like), and consonants like L, D, G, C, M, etc.

A good next guess should:
- End in E (keep the ✓).
- Include U and T, but in new positions.
- Avoid all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S, N, I).
- Introduce a new consonant or two.

Candidate words:
- ""DUETE"" – but E is already confirmed at end, and D is new, but U is 2nd and T is 3rd, which is same as their last positions (but we need to move them). Also ""DUETE"" is not valid (has double E).
- ""LUTE"" is only 4 letters, so invalid.
- ""GLUTE"" – has N (ruled out).
- ""MUTED"" – ends with D, but we need E at end.
- ""CUTIE"" – has I (ruled out).
- ""FLUTE"" – F is new, L is new, U is 2nd (new position), T is 3rd (new position), ends with E. All letters are allowed (F, L, U, T, E). No ruled-out letters appear.

""FLUTE"" fits all constraints:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Uses U at position 2 (was position 1 in guess 2, so new position).
- Uses T at position 3 (was position 3 in guess 2 – but we have no better position, and we need to test if T is elsewhere).
- Introduces F and L which are new high-frequency consonants.
