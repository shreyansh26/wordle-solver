- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Since this is the first guess, we have no feedback to guide us. A good first strategy is to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: C, R, N

This should help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

We now know:

- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is _ _ _ N _. We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E.

Let’s list common consonants and vowels still allowed:
Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

We want a word that uses these remaining letters efficiently. A good next step is to test other common vowels and consonants. The word ""POINT"" fits:
- P, O, I, N, T
- N is in the 4th position (satisfies feedback)
- Does not contain C, R, A, E
- Tests new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T)

From the latest feedback:

- Pattern still ends in _ _ I N G (I, N, G are all ✓ in their final positions).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it got ""-"" there twice).
- F is NOT in the word (x).

Letters already ruled out:  
C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, D, S, F.

Available letters for the first two positions:  
Consonants left: H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowel left: U

We need a real 5-letter word of the form **? ? I N G** that uses only the remaining letters and does not have L in the 2nd spot.

Possible two-letter starts with allowed letters:  
- H U, H J, H K, H M, …  
- U is the only vowel left, so we can combine it with any allowed consonant.

Valid English words that fit:  
- using U in position 1: nothing common ends in “UING”.  
- using consonant + U:  
  – M U I N G → “M-U-I-N-G” is invalid (no such word).  
- other consonant pairs:  
  – V I N G is impossible (needs two more letters).  
  – K I N G is only 4 letters.  
  – W I N G is only 4 letters.  
  – …  

Actually, the only common 5-letter word ending in I N G with the above constraints is **CLING**, but C is already ruled out.  
Next is **FLING** (already tried).  
After that, **SLING** (tried).  
**BLING** (B ruled out).  

Wait—try **K-I-N-G-?** No.  
**V I N G-?** No.  

Let’s recheck: valid 5-letter words ending in **...ING** that do **NOT** contain any of the eliminated letters and do **NOT** have L in the 2nd position:

- **HINGE** – ends in “NGE”, not “ING”.  
- **MULCH** – irrelevant.  
- **WINGS** – ends in “INGS”.  

Actually, scan all 5-letter words ending in I N G:

- **ACING** – contains A and C (both ruled out).  
- **AKING** – A, K, I, N, G → A ruled out.  
- **APING** – A, P ruled out.  
- **AWING** – A ruled out.  
- **AXING** – A, X ruled out.  
- **AYING** – A, Y; valid letters, but does it fit pattern? A Y I N G – A is ruled out.

- **EYING** – E, Y; E ruled out.  
- **FLING** – already tried.  
- **GOING** – G, O ruled out.  
- **HYING** – H, Y; H allowed, Y allowed, but word is “HYING”.  Pattern: H Y I N G. Let’s check letters: H, Y, I, N, G — none are ruled out except L and the already-eliminated set. This is valid.

Therefore, the only remaining plausible candidate is **HYING**.
