1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to gather maximum information. Classic starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- I: ✓ → in the word and in the correct (3rd) position
- S: - → in the word but not in the 2nd position
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word has the form _ _ I _ _ with I fixed in position 3.
- It contains the letter S somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Good consonants to try next include N, T, L, C, D, M, etc., and vowels left are O and U.  
I want a word that:
1. Places I in the 3rd spot.
2. Puts S somewhere other than position 2.
3. Avoids R, A, E.
4. Uses common remaining letters to maximize info.

Candidate words: STINT, SNOUT, SLING, SPOIL, DOING, CHOIR, etc.
""POINT"" is invalid because it lacks S. ""STINT"" has S in position 1 and is valid, but let’s check: S T I N T → uses remaining letters T, N and satisfies constraints.

Another good option is ""SNOUT"" (S N O U T).  It has S in position 1, uses O and U, avoids ruled-out letters. This seems slightly more informative due to two new vowels.

I'll go with ""SNOUT"".

We now know the exact pattern:  

S _ I F T  

with only the second letter unknown.  
We also know the letters that have been ruled out across all guesses:
R, A, E, N, O, U, H.

The remaining letters that can legally occupy position 2 (and have not been used yet) are:
B, C, D, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking at common English 5-letter words that fit S _ I F T, only two frequent candidates emerge:
- SWIFT  (but W in position 2 was never tested and is still allowed)
- SPIFT  (not a standard word)
- SKIFT  (valid, but uncommon)
- SLIFT  (not a word)
- SMIFT  (not a word)

The only standard dictionary word that remains is SWIFT.  
However, we already tried SHIFT and got H(x), so SWIFT is also a possibility because W hasn’t been tested.

But let’s re-examine: we have used S, I, F, T already. The only untested common letter for position 2 that forms a valid word is W.

So the only logical word left is SWIFT.  
Let me verify:  
S W I F T – all letters are allowed; none ruled out, and it matches our pattern.

Therefore, the next (and likely final) guess is SWIFT.
