For the first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and covering different vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (has A, R, O, S, E - covers many common letters)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's highly regarded by Wordle analysis tools, containing:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of top letters across different positions.

Let’s update what we know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R, A, S are out.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

From Guess 2 (ELITE):
- E in position 1 is wrong (E is only in position 5).
- L not in the word.
- I not in position 3 (already known) and now we also know I is not in position 2.
- T not in the word.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, L, T.
- Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.

We have the pattern so far:
- Possible positions for I: 1 or 4.
- Position 5 is E.
- Positions 2 and 3 must be letters other than R, A, S, L, T.

Let’s try to place I in position 1 and see if we can find a valid word:
I _ _ _ E
We need two consonants (positions 2 and 3) and they must be from remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Candidate consonants: N, C, D, M, P, etc.
A possible word: “INODE” – but “INODE” is not a common word.
Another: “IMIDE” – has I twice, which is unlikely given no repeats so far.
“ICEBE” – not valid.
“INDUE” – valid word, uses N, D, U.

Let’s try placing I in position 4 instead:
_ _ _ I E
We need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and one consonant or vowel in position 3 (but vowels available: O, U since A is out and I, E are used).
Possible words:
“CHIVE” – but V is in position 4, not I.
“NOISE” – has S (out) and O, but S is out.
“PRIDE” – has R (out).
“CHIDE” – valid word, uses C, H, I (position 4), D, E.

So “CHIDE” fits:
- Ends in E.
- I is in position 4 (not 2 or 3).
- Uses C, H, D which haven’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (R, A, S, L, T).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R, A, S are out.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

From Guess 2 (ELITE):
- E in position 1 is wrong (E is only in position 5).
- L not in the word.
- I not in position 3 (already known) and now we also know I is not in position 2.
- T not in the word.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, L, T.
- Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.

We have the pattern so far:
- Possible positions for I: 1 or 4.
- Position 5 is E.
- Positions 2 and 3 must be letters other than R, A, S, L, T.

Let’s try to place I in position 1 and see if we can find a valid word:
I _ _ _ E
We need two consonants (positions 2 and 3) and they must be from remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Candidate consonants: N, C, D, M, P, etc.
A possible word: “INODE” – but “INODE” is not a common word.
Another: “IMIDE” – has I twice, which is unlikely given no repeats so far.
“ICEBE” – not valid.
“INDUE” – valid word, uses N, D, U.

Let’s try placing I in position 4 instead:
_ _ _ I E
We need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and one consonant or vowel in position 3 (but vowels available: O, U since A is out and I, E are used).
Possible words:
“CHIVE” – but V is in position 4, not I.
“NOISE” – has S (out) and O, but S is out.
“PRIDE” – has R (out).
“CHIDE” – valid word, uses C, H, I (position 4), D, E.

So “CHIDE” fits:
- Ends in E.
- I is in position 4 (not 2 or 3).
- Uses C, H, D which haven’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (R, A, S, L, T).

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (has A, R, O, S, E - covers many common letters)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's highly regarded by Wordle analysis tools, containing:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of top letters across different positions.

- Still unknown: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:

Good candidate letters for the remaining spots: common consonants like N, T, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels O, U (since A is out and E/I are already used).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Position 5 is definitely E (✓ in every guess).
2. The word contains the letter I, but after four guesses we have:
   - I(-) in Guess 4 (IMBUE) means I is NOT in position 1.
   - From earlier feedback, I is also not in positions 2, 3, or 4.
   - Therefore the letter I must be in position 5 … but position 5 is already E.
   - This is a contradiction.

Re-examining feedback:
- Guess 1: I(-) → I is in word, wrong slot (not 3)
- Guess 2: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 2, 3
- Guess 3: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 3, 4
- Guess 4: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 1

There is no remaining position for I while keeping E fixed in position 5.  
Hence the only possibility is that the earlier interpretation was wrong: the feedback I(-) in Guess 4 must have been a typo and should have been I(✓).  
But since we must take the feedback literally, the contradiction implies our previous conclusion was incomplete.

Rechecking the constraints:
- Position 5 = E (✓ always)
- I must appear somewhere, but all positions 1-4 have been ruled out by (-) feedback.
- This can only happen if the word contains I twice, which Wordle does not do (letters appear once).

Realizing the only consistent resolution is that I must actually be in position 4 (the feedback for CHIDE had I(-) meaning not in 3, but position 4 wasn’t explicitly ruled out until now).  
However, the feedback for CHIDE shows position 4 as D(x) and I(-), so position 4 is not I.  
Thus position 4 is ruled out too.

This indicates an inconsistency with the feedback or my interpretation.  
Stepping back: the feedback ""I(-)"" in Guess 4 means I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
Earlier feedback:
- Guess 1: I(-) → not position 3
- Guess 2: I(-) → not position 2 or 3
- Guess 3: I(-) → not position 3 or 4
- Guess 4: I(-) → not position 1

Hence I cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, yet word is 5 letters and position 5 is E.  
This is impossible unless the word contains I twice, which standard Wordle does not allow.  
Therefore the only remaining logical conclusion is that the letter I does not appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully: in Guess 2 (ELITE) the ""I(-)"" means I is in the word but not in position 3; it does NOT rule out position 2.  
Similarly, Guess 3 (CHIDE) has I(-) meaning not in position 3; it doesn't rule out 2 or 4.  
Guess 4 (IMBUE) has I(-) meaning not in position 1; it doesn't rule out 2,3,4.

So I is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore I can be in 2 or 4.

Current pattern:
- Position 5: E (✓)
- I must be in position 2 or 4
- Letters ruled out so far: R, A, S, L, T, C, H, D, M, B, U
- Remaining common letters: N, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, Y, O, etc.

Let’s try:
- If I is in position 2: _ I _ _ E
  Valid English words: WIDEN (D out), VIXEN (V,I,X,E,N), PIXIE (I twice), FIQUE (invalid), GIVEN (G,I,V,E,N)
- If I is in position 4: _ _ _ I E
  Valid words: “PIXIE” (I twice), “ZOWIE” (Z,O,W,I,E) – O,W,I,E; O not ruled out, W not ruled out
  “ZOWIE” is a valid exclamation (informal).

Checking ZOWIE:
- Z not ruled out
- O not ruled out
- W not ruled out
- I in position 4
- E in position 5
- No letters from the banned list

Thus the next logical guess is ZOWIE.

Guess 4 (IMBUE) has I(-) meaning not in position 1; it doesn't rule out 2,3,4.

So I is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore I can be in 2 or 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and covering different vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (has A, R, O, S, E - covers many common letters)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's highly regarded by Wordle analysis tools, containing:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of top letters across different positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).

So the secret word:
- Ends with E
- Contains I somewhere other than position 3
- Does not contain R, A, or S
- Still unknown: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Includes I but not in spot 3
- Excludes R, A, S

Good candidate letters for the remaining spots: common consonants like N, T, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels O, U (since A is out and E/I are already used).

Candidate words:
- “UNTIE” – but the I is in position 3 (disallowed)
- “OLIVE” – ends in E, has I not in 3, and uses O, L, V
- “ELITE” – ends in E, has I not in 3, uses L, T

I’ll pick “ELITE”:
- E (✓) in position 5
- I in position 2
- Uses L, T which are common and not yet tested
- Excludes R, A, S

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R, A, S are out.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

From Guess 2 (ELITE):
- E in position 1 is wrong (E is only in position 5).
- L not in the word.
- I not in position 3 (already known) and now we also know I is not in position 2.
- T not in the word.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends in E.
- Contains I, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, L, T.
- Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.

We have the pattern so far:
- Possible positions for I: 1 or 4.
- Position 5 is E.
- Positions 2 and 3 must be letters other than R, A, S, L, T.

Let’s try to place I in position 1 and see if we can find a valid word:
I _ _ _ E
We need two consonants (positions 2 and 3) and they must be from remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Candidate consonants: N, C, D, M, P, etc.
A possible word: “INODE” – but “INODE” is not a common word.
Another: “IMIDE” – has I twice, which is unlikely given no repeats so far.
“ICEBE” – not valid.
“INDUE” – valid word, uses N, D, U.

Let’s try placing I in position 4 instead:
_ _ _ I E
We need two consonants in positions 1 and 2, and one consonant or vowel in position 3 (but vowels available: O, U since A is out and I, E are used).
Possible words:
“CHIVE” – but V is in position 4, not I.
“NOISE” – has S (out) and O, but S is out.
“PRIDE” – has R (out).
“CHIDE” – valid word, uses C, H, I (position 4), D, E.

So “CHIDE” fits:
- Ends in E.
- I is in position 4 (not 2 or 3).
- Uses C, H, D which haven’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (R, A, S, L, T).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updating what we now know:

Known:
- Position 5 = E (from all three guesses)
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from ELITE and CHIDE)
- Therefore I must be in position 1
- Letters ruled out so far: R, A, S, L, T, C, H, D

So the pattern is:
I _ _ _ E
with remaining letters for positions 2,3,4 drawn from the still-available alphabet (excluding the ruled-out letters and without repeating I or E).

Common remaining consonants/vowels:
B, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses three of those allowed letters in the middle.

Possible candidates:
- INGLE – but G, L, E: L is out (ruled out)
- INURE – uses N, U, R: R is out
- INKLE – uses N, K, L: L is out
- IMINE – uses M, I, N, E: repeats I (invalid)
- IMBUE – uses M, B, U: all still allowed

""IMBUE"" fits all constraints:
- starts with I (position 1)
- ends with E (position 5)
- middle letters: M, B, U – none ruled out
- no repeats

   - From earlier feedback, I is also not in positions 2, 3, or 4.
   - Therefore the letter I must be in position 5 … but position 5 is already E.
   - This is a contradiction.

Re-examining feedback:
- Guess 1: I(-) → I is in word, wrong slot (not 3)
- Guess 2: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 2, 3
- Guess 3: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 3, 4
- Guess 4: I(-) → I still in word, not in slot 1

There is no remaining position for I while keeping E fixed in position 5.  
Hence the only possibility is that the earlier interpretation was wrong: the feedback I(-) in Guess 4 must have been a typo and should have been I(✓).  
But since we must take the feedback literally, the contradiction implies our previous conclusion was incomplete.

Rechecking the constraints:
- Position 5 = E (✓ always)

- Guess 4: I(-) → not position 1

Hence I cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, yet word is 5 letters and position 5 is E.  
This is impossible unless the word contains I twice, which standard Wordle does not allow.  
Therefore the only remaining logical conclusion is that the letter I does not appear at all, which contradicts the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback carefully: in Guess 2 (ELITE) the ""I(-)"" means I is in the word but not in position 3; it does NOT rule out position 2.  
Similarly, Guess 3 (CHIDE) has I(-) meaning not in position 3; it doesn't rule out 2 or 4.  
Guess 4 (IMBUE) has I(-) meaning not in position 1; it doesn't rule out 2,3,4.

So I is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore I can be in 2 or 4.

Current pattern:
- Position 5: E (✓)
- I must be in position 2 or 4
- Letters ruled out so far: R, A, S, L, T, C, H, D, M, B, U
- Remaining common letters: N, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, Y, O, etc.

Let’s try:
- If I is in position 2: _ I _ _ E

  Valid words: “PIXIE” (I twice), “ZOWIE” (Z,O,W,I,E) – O,W,I,E; O not ruled out, W not ruled out
  “ZOWIE” is a valid exclamation (informal).

Checking ZOWIE:
- Z not ruled out

Let's carefully collect every constraint that is now certain:

- Word ends with E (position 5 always ✓).

- Letter I is definitely in the word, yet every single position has been rejected at least once:
  – Guess 1 (RAISE): I(-) → not position 3  
  – Guess 2 (ELITE): I(-) → not position 2 or 3  
  – Guess 3 (CHIDE): I(-) → not position 3 or 4  
  – Guess 4 (IMBUE): I(-) → not position 1  
  – Guess 5 (ZOWIE): I(-) → not position 4  

Positions checked: 1, 2, 3, 4 all show “wrong position” for I, while position 5 is already E.  
This is only possible if the word contains *two* I’s, with one of them in position 5.  
But position 5 is E, not I, so the only remaining explanation is that the feedback must intend for I to appear exactly once somewhere, yet all feasible positions are ruled out.

However, standard Wordle puzzles do not use repeated letters, and the feedback given is unambiguous.  
Re-reading the feedback literally: each “I(-)” only rules out the *current* position; it does **not** rule out any other specific positions unless explicitly stated.  
Let’s list the *strict* exclusions:

- From Guess 4: I is **not** in position 1.  
- From Guess 2: I is **not** in position 2.  
- From Guess 1 & 3: I is **not** in position 3.  
- From Guess 3 & 5: I is **not** in position 4.  

Thus **I cannot appear in any of positions 1-4**, but position 5 is E, so the word **cannot contain I at all**.  
This directly contradicts every “I(-)” statement.  
Therefore the feedback chain is logically impossible under normal Wordle rules.

The only plausible resolution is that one of the “I(-)” notations was mis-transcribed.  
Given that we must proceed with the feedback as given, the puzzle is unsolvable.

Nevertheless, if we assume the feedback for Guess 5 (ZOWIE) **should have read I(✓)** (i.e., I is in position 4), then the pattern becomes:

_ _ _ I E

and we already know:
- excluded letters: R, A, S, L, T, C, H, D, M, B, U, Z, O, W

Remaining consonants for positions 1-2-3: N, F, G, J, K, P, V, Y  
Remaining vowels: none except the fixed I & E.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “IE” and using only the still-allowed letters:

- NIXIE (X out via Z? no X used yet, but X not ruled out)  
- KRIKE – invalid  
- PYGIE – invalid  
- GNPIE – invalid  

Only “NIXIE” is valid, but X hasn’t been tested; it is unrestricted.

Given the impossibility otherwise, we adopt the most consistent next move under the assumption that I is indeed in position 4, yielding the pattern _ _ _ I E.

The only common word left respecting all exclusions is:

N   I   X   I   E   (NIXIE) – but this repeats I.  
The only non-repeating candidate remaining is **“KNIFE”**, but F and K are not ruled out.

Wait – check letters:
Positions 1-2-3 must avoid all banned letters and supply two consonants + one vowel or vice-versa.

Actually simpler: we are left with positions 1-2-3 from {N, F, G, J, K, P, V, Y}.  
A valid English word ending in I E that also uses only those letters is **KNIFE**.

Check:
K – not ruled out  
N – not ruled out  
I – in position 4 (✓)  
F – not ruled out  
E – in position 5 (✓)  

No banned letters used.

Therefore, the only coherent next guess is KNIFE.
