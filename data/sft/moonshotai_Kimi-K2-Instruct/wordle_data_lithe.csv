For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that has common letters and covers a good distribution of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should contain several of these. ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Other strong options are ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a common favorite among Wordle players and gives excellent coverage of common letters.

- I is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 3, so I is not in position 3)

3. Letters I, L, T are in the word but not in positions shown in ELITE (I≠3, L≠2, T≠4)
4. Letters R, A, S are excluded
5. From RAISE, we also know I ≠ 3 (confirmed again here)

So the word has the structure: _ _ _ _ E with the letters I, L, T appearing somewhere in positions 1–4 (but not in their previous positions).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3

We also need to fill in the remaining slot(s) with letters not yet tried (avoiding R, A, S, and also avoiding E except at position 5).

- Example candidates:

  - LITRE (but R is excluded)
  - TILDE (has T, I, L, D, E) - let's check:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's parse the new feedback:

Guess 2: ELITE → E(-) L(-) I(-) T(-) E(✓)

- First E is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 1, so E is definitely not in position 1)
- Second E is in the correct position (position 5)
- L is in the word but wrong position
- I is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 3, so I is not in position 3)
- T is in the word but wrong position (it was in position 4, so T is not in position 4)

Known facts:
1. Word ends in E (position 5)
2. E is not in position 1
3. Letters I, L, T are in the word but not in positions shown in ELITE (I≠3, L≠2, T≠4)
4. Letters R, A, S are excluded
5. From RAISE, we also know I ≠ 3 (confirmed again here)

So the word has the structure: _ _ _ _ E with the letters I, L, T appearing somewhere in positions 1–4 (but not in their previous positions).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3

We also need to fill in the remaining slot(s) with letters not yet tried (avoiding R, A, S, and also avoiding E except at position 5).

Common remaining letters: N, D, G, O, U, etc.

Looking for words that fit:
- Must have I, L, T, and end in E
- Example candidates: 
  - TITLE (but T in position 4 was original position, but T was position 4 in ELITE which was wrong, so T cannot be in 4, but TITLE has T in 1 and 4 - 4 is invalid, so exclude)
  - LITRE (but R is excluded)
  - TILDE (has T, I, L, D, E) - let's check:
    - T in 1: allowed (was in 4 before, now 1)
    - I in 2: allowed (was in 3 before, now 2)
    - L in 3: allowed (was in 2 before, now 3)
    - D in 4: new letter, fine
    - E in 5: correct
  - No conflicts with known information.

TILDE seems to fit all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- Word ends with E (position 5 confirmed)
- Contains I, L, T (but not in their previous positions)
- Excludes R, A, S
- TILDE uses T, I, L, D, E with:
  - T in position 1 (new position)
  - I in position 2 (new position)
  - L in position 3 (new position)
  - D is new and acceptable

Let's summarize what we now know from the three guesses.

1. RAISE → R(x), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(✓)  
   - E is in position 5.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - R, A, S are NOT in the word.

2. ELITE → E(-), L(-), I(-), T(-), E(✓)  
   - First E is wrong position (so E is not in position 1).  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Second E is in the correct position (position 5).

3. TILDE → T(-), I(✓), L(-), D(x), E(✓)  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - I is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - D is NOT in the word.  
   - E is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is:  
_ I _ _ E

And we know:
- T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
- E is fixed in position 5.  
- I is fixed in position 2.  
- R, A, S, D are not in the word.  
- E is not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (it’s only in 5).

Possible positions for T: positions 3 or 5, but 5 is E, so T must be in position 3.  
Possible positions for L: positions 1 or 4 (since not in 2 or 3).  
Remaining letters to fill: we need a consonant for position 1 or 4 (whichever L isn't in).  

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: L in position 1  
Word structure: L I T _ E  
Need a letter for position 4. Valid letters not used yet: N, G, O, U, Y, etc.  
Possible words: LITNE, LITGE, LITOE, LITUE... but none of these are valid English words.

Option 2: L in position 4  
Word structure: _ I T L E  
Need a letter for position 1. Valid letters not used yet: N, G, O, U, Y, etc.  
Possible words: NITLE, GITLE, OITLE, UITLE... but the only valid 5-letter word ending in ITLE is ""TITLE"".

However, let's check if TITLE fits all constraints:
- T in position 1: but from TILDE feedback, T is not in position 1. So TITLE is invalid because T cannot be in position 1.

This suggests an inconsistency - but I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine:

From TILDE feedback:
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1. So T must be in position 3 (as pos 2 is I, pos 4 is ?, pos 5 is E).  
Thus, word must be: _ I T _ E  

From ELITE feedback:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3, so L must be in position 1 or 4.

From RAISE feedback:
- No restrictions beyond R, A, S excluded.

Now, possible words:
1. L I T _ E → LIT_E  
   Need a letter for position 4. Valid letters not used: N, G, O, U, Y, etc.  
   Possible valid word: LITRE (but R is excluded), LITNE (invalid), LITGE (invalid), LITHE (H is allowed but was H used? No, H hasn't been used).  
   LITHE is valid: L I T H E. Check constraints:
   - H hasn't been tested, so it's possible.

2. _ I T L E → ? I T L E  
   Need a letter for position 1. Valid letters: N, G, O, U, C, etc.  
   Possible words: NITLE (invalid), GITLE (invalid), CITLE (invalid), VITLE (invalid), WITLE (invalid)... none valid.

Thus, the only valid word seems to be LITHE.
</think>

The feedback has narrowed it down to:

- Word is _ I T _ E  
- L must be in position 1 or 4  
- After checking, the only valid English word fitting all constraints is LITHE.
