For my first guess, I need a word that will give me as much information as possible about the secret word. The best initial words are those that contain common letters in English, especially vowels and frequently occurring consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE"" are often recommended because they cover many common letters.

I'm going to choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

The feedback shows only the letter E is in the word (✓) and it is in the correct position (last position).  
Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).  
Therefore, the secret word ends in E and contains none of S, L, A, T.

A good second guess should:
- keep E fixed in the 5th position,
- avoid S, L, A, T,
- introduce as many new common letters as possible to maximize information.

Common letters not yet used: R, I, N, O, C, H, U, D, M, G, Y, etc.

A balanced choice that covers five new letters and keeps E in place is “RINSE”.  
It introduces R, I, N, S, but S was already excluded, so that’s bad—change it.

Let me pick “CRONE” instead: C, R, O, N are new and common, and E stays in place.  
Wait, C is fine—no conflict.

Actually, to stay safe with no overlap, “CRONE” uses C, R, O, N, E.  
Double-check: none of C, R, O, N are in the banned set S, L, A, T.

So the next guess is CRONE.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. E is in position 5 (✓ in both guesses).
2. R, O, N are in the word (✓) but not yet placed in the correct positions.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C.
4. The pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E with R, O, N somewhere among the first four positions.

Possible positions:
- R, O, N must occupy three of the first four slots (positions 1-4) in some order.
- One remaining slot (positions 1-4) must be filled by another letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Common unused letters that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses R, O, N in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
- Introduces a new common letter in the remaining slot.

Looking at the positions:
- In CRONE, R was in position 2 (✓ but wrong spot), so R can’t be in 2.
- O was in position 3 (✓ but wrong spot), so O can’t be in 3.
- N was in position 4 (✓ but wrong spot), so N can’t be in 4.

Possible arrangements:
- R can be in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
- O can be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- N can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s try to place R, O, N in new positions and add a new letter. A good candidate is “HORNE” (but HORNE isn’t a valid 5-letter word). Next idea: “FROND” – but D is fine, yet O was 3rd in CRONE and now would be 2nd, R would be 1st (new placement), N would be 4th (but N can’t be 4th). Not valid.

Better: “PRONE” – but P is new, and positions:
- P (new letter)
- R (position 2 again – but R can’t be 2) – invalid.

Next: “BROKE” – but B is new, positions:
- B (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid, same issue).

“GROIN” – but E must be last, so this is invalid.

“IRONE” – I is new, positions:
- I (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid).

“DRONE” – D is new, positions:
- D (new)
- R (1st – new spot, allowed)
- O (2nd – new spot, allowed)
- N (3rd – new spot, allowed)
- E (5th – correct)

This fits all constraints:
- D is new and not ruled out.
- R is now in position 1 (new, allowed).
- O is now in position 2 (new, allowed).
- N is now in position 3 (new, allowed).
- E stays in position 5 (✓).

So “DRONE” is a valid next guess.
