For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Ideally, this word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) to test their presence
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage across common letters and positions. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""SLATE"" is statistically strong. Since we have no prior information, any of these would be reasonable first guesses. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words.

- A(x): not in the word  
- T(x): not in the word  
- E(-): the letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position

2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

- Excludes S, L, A, T.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

A balanced next word would include some of these common consonants plus E in a non-final position. ""CRANE"" might have been nice, but it uses A and N, and A is already excluded. ""CHORE"" is possible (C, H, O, R, E), but let's keep it simple and use a different set.

""ROBED"" would test R, O, B, E, D.  
- E is not in the 5th spot (it’s in the 4th spot).  
- It avoids S, L, A, T.  

Another alternative is ""MONEY"" (M, O, N, E, Y) – again avoids the excluded letters and puts E in the 4th spot.  

I’ll choose ""ROBED"" because it spreads consonants across early positions while keeping E in slot 4.

Let's pick ""HONEY"":
- H: new, untested.
- O: known to be in the word.
- N: new, untested.
- E: known to be in the word.
- Y: new, untested.

This tests new letters (H, N, Y) while placing O and E in new positions.

From the three guesses we have the following consolidated information.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
S, L, A, T, R, B, D, H, N  

Letters that ARE in the word (from “-” feedback) and one already placed (from “✓”):  
- O is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.  
- Y is in the word AND is in position 5.  

So the secret word is of the form  
_ _ _ _ Y  
and it must contain both O and E somewhere in the first four positions.

Untested common letters left: C, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that  
- ends in Y,  
- contains both O and E,  
- excludes every letter in {S,L,A,T,R,B,D,H,N},  
- and places O and E in allowed spots (positions 1-4).

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:  
- POKEY (P,O,K,E,Y)  
- MOPEY (M,O,P,E,Y)  
- COVEY (but V is allowed, yet C and V untested)  

Among these, POKEY uses P, O, K, E, Y and fits all constraints:
  – Y is fixed at slot 5 (✓).  
  – O is in slot 2 (allowed, since earlier feedback said O is not in slot 2 of ROBED, but that only ruled out slot 2 for O in that specific guess; slot 2 is still possible in the secret word).  
  – E is in slot 4 (allowed, because the feedback that E is not in slot 4 came from ROBED, but that was E in slot 4 of the guess; in the secret word E can indeed be in slot 4).  

Let’s verify uniqueness: P, O, K, E, Y have not appeared in any prior guess, and none of them are in the banned set except O and E which we know are present.  

Therefore POKEY is a solid next guess.

A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage across common letters and positions. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""SLATE"" is statistically strong. Since we have no prior information, any of these would be reasonable first guesses. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that uses only the allowed letters and includes both O and E.

Candidate list:

But COVEY puts O in position 2: prior feedback says O is in the word but not in that exact position in previous guesses; that does not forbid position 2 in the secret word.  
Let me test another: MOE CY (invalid length).  
Next possible: FOYCE – invalid, not a word.  
Another: GOM EY – invalid.  
Real dictionary words: COMFY (no E), COMET (no Y).  
Real candidate: COVEY.

But let me double-check COVEY:  
C, O, V, E, Y – none of C, V, O, E, Y are banned except we know O and E must be somewhere; positions:  
C(1) O(2) V(3) E(4) Y(5) – satisfies ending Y, contains both O and E, and letters C and V are new.  

Another candidate is MOE CY (invalid).  
Another valid word: VOWEL – but has L (banned).  
Another valid word: MOVEY – but MOVEY would end in Y and have O and E inside, but M is allowed:  
M O V E Y – positions 1-5: M O V E Y – this also satisfies all constraints.

Between COVEY and MOVEY, MOVEY uses M, O, V, E, Y – all allowed and untouched letters.  

So MOVEY is the next logical guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,DECOY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Ideally, this word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) to test their presence
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage across common letters and positions. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""SLATE"" is statistically strong. Since we have no prior information, any of these would be reasonable first guesses. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x): not in the word  
- L(x): not in the word  
- A(x): not in the word  
- T(x): not in the word  
- E(-): the letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position  

So we know:
1. The word contains E, but not in position 5.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E, but not in slot 5.
- Excludes S, L, A, T.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

A balanced next word would include some of these common consonants plus E in a non-final position. ""CRANE"" might have been nice, but it uses A and N, and A is already excluded. ""CHORE"" is possible (C, H, O, R, E), but let's keep it simple and use a different set.

""ROBED"" would test R, O, B, E, D.  
- E is not in the 5th spot (it’s in the 4th spot).  
- It avoids S, L, A, T.  

Another alternative is ""MONEY"" (M, O, N, E, Y) – again avoids the excluded letters and puts E in the 4th spot.  

I’ll choose ""ROBED"" because it spreads consonants across early positions while keeping E in slot 4.

<guess>ROBED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) B(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's update what we know after the second guess.

Previous feedback:
- SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
- ROBED → R(x) O(-) B(x) E(-) D(-)

From both guesses:
Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, R, B, D
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: E, O (each appeared with ""-"" feedback)

So the word contains both E and O, but we don't know where yet. We also know it must use letters not yet tried from the remaining alphabet.

Remaining common letters to test: N, I, C, H, U, G, M, F, K, Y, W, V, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both E and O.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, R, B, D.
3. Uses new letters not yet tested.

Good candidates: ""CHONE"" (but C and H are untested), ""GENIE"" (but G and N are untested, and E appears twice which might be inefficient), ""HONEY"" (but H and N are untested), ""OUNCE"" (but U, N, C are untested).

Let's pick ""HONEY"":
- H: new, untested.
- O: known to be in the word.
- N: new, untested.
- E: known to be in the word.
- Y: new, untested.

This tests new letters (H, N, Y) while placing O and E in new positions.

<guess>HONEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) B(x) E(-) D(-)
Guess 3: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have the following consolidated information.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
S, L, A, T, R, B, D, H, N  

Letters that ARE in the word (from “-” feedback) and one already placed (from “✓”):  
- O is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.  
- Y is in the word AND is in position 5.  

So the secret word is of the form  
_ _ _ _ Y  
and it must contain both O and E somewhere in the first four positions.

Untested common letters left: C, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that  
- ends in Y,  
- contains both O and E,  
- excludes every letter in {S,L,A,T,R,B,D,H,N},  
- and places O and E in allowed spots (positions 1-4).

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:  
- POKEY (P,O,K,E,Y)  
- MOPEY (M,O,P,E,Y)  
- COVEY (but V is allowed, yet C and V untested)  

Among these, POKEY uses P, O, K, E, Y and fits all constraints:
  – Y is fixed at slot 5 (✓).  
  – O is in slot 2 (allowed, since earlier feedback said O is not in slot 2 of ROBED, but that only ruled out slot 2 for O in that specific guess; slot 2 is still possible in the secret word).  
  – E is in slot 4 (allowed, because the feedback that E is not in slot 4 came from ROBED, but that was E in slot 4 of the guess; in the secret word E can indeed be in slot 4).  

Let’s verify uniqueness: P, O, K, E, Y have not appeared in any prior guess, and none of them are in the banned set except O and E which we know are present.  

Therefore POKEY is a solid next guess.

Word pattern: _ _ _ _ Y  
Must contain both O and E in the first four positions.

- COVEY (already ruled out – C, O, V, E, Y but V is allowed, yet in COVEY the Y is in the right place: let me check) – COVEY ends in Y, has O, E, and letters C, O, V, E, Y – C and V not yet banned.  
But COVEY puts O in position 2: prior feedback says O is in the word but not in that exact position in previous guesses; that does not forbid position 2 in the secret word.  
Let me test another: MOE CY (invalid length).  
Next possible: FOYCE – invalid, not a word.  
Another: GOM EY – invalid.  
Real dictionary words: COMFY (no E), COMET (no Y).  
Real candidate: COVEY.

But let me double-check COVEY:  
C, O, V, E, Y – none of C, V, O, E, Y are banned except we know O and E must be somewhere; positions:  
C(1) O(2) V(3) E(4) Y(5) – satisfies ending Y, contains both O and E, and letters C and V are new.  

Another candidate is MOE CY (invalid).  
Another valid word: VOWEL – but has L (banned).  
Another valid word: MOVEY – but MOVEY would end in Y and have O and E inside, but M is allowed:  
M O V E Y – positions 1-5: M O V E Y – this also satisfies all constraints.

Between COVEY and MOVEY, MOVEY uses M, O, V, E, Y – all allowed and untouched letters.  

So MOVEY is the next logical guess.

Letters known to be present:  
- Y in position 5 (✓)  
- O somewhere in the word but not yet placed (always “-”)  
- E somewhere in the word but not yet placed (always “-”)  

Thus the word looks like: _ _ _ _ Y  
and must contain both O and E within the first four positions.

Untried letters that are still allowed:  
C, F, G, I, J, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus repeats, but we avoid them).

We need a five-letter word ending in Y, using only the remaining letters, and containing both O and E.

Candidate words:

- WOOEY (invalid)  
- GOWEY (invalid)  

Actual valid English words remaining:
- COZEY  (C O Z E Y)  
- FOGEY  (F O G E Y)

Both satisfy:  
- Ends in Y.  
- Uses only untried letters.  
- Contains O and E in positions 1-4.  

Between the two, I’ll pick FOGEY.

(Verification: F O G E Y  
F, G untried; O and E needed; letters absent list not violated; positions not ruled out.)

<guess>FOGEY</guess>",FOGEY,"Let me list the cumulative constraints.

Letters known to be absent:  
S L A T R B D H N P K M V  

Letters known to be present:  
- Y in position 5 (✓)  
- O somewhere in the word but not yet placed (always “-”)  
- E somewhere in the word but not yet placed (always “-”)  

Thus the word looks like: _ _ _ _ Y  
and must contain both O and E within the first four positions.

Untried letters that are still allowed:  
C, F, G, I, J, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus repeats, but we avoid them).

We need a five-letter word ending in Y, using only the remaining letters, and containing both O and E.

Candidate words:
- COZEY  
- FOGEY  
- JOE CY (invalid length)  
- WOOEY (invalid)  
- GOWEY (invalid)  

Actual valid English words remaining:
- COZEY  (C O Z E Y)  
- FOGEY  (F O G E Y)

Both satisfy:  
- Ends in Y.  
- Uses only untried letters.  
- Contains O and E in positions 1-4.  

Between the two, I’ll pick FOGEY.
