For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters that will help me quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. The best starting words usually contain a good mix of vowels and common consonants. Some of the most effective starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'm going to go with ""CRANE"" as it's one of the most popular and statistically effective starting words. It contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about many common letters right away.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked with “x”, which means none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, I must avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.

Good consonants that remain available: S, T, L, M, P, D, F, G, H, B, K, etc.  
Good vowels that remain available: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

I want a word that uses several of those remaining high-frequency letters so I can quickly narrow down possibilities.  
A common starting word that avoids CRANE’s letters is “SLIMY” (S, L, I, M, Y), or “DOUBT” (D, O, U, B, T).  

I’ll choose “SLIMY” because it gives me three fresh consonants (S, L, M) plus one fresh vowel (I) and Y as a sometimes-vowel sometimes-consonant, maximizing information.

The best starting words usually contain a good mix of vowels and common consonants. Some of the most effective starting words include:\n\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)\n- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)\n- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)\n\nI\'m going to go with ""CRANE"" as it\'s one of the most popular and statistically effective starting words. It contains:\n- C (common consonant)\n- R (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- N (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis should give me good information about many common letters right away.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked with “x”, which means none of them appear in the secret word at all.  \nTherefore, I must avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.\n\nGood consonants that remain available: S, T, L, M, P, D, F, G, H, B, K, etc.  \nGood vowels that remain available: I, O, U (since A and E are out).\n\nI want a word that uses several of those remaining high-frequency letters so I can quickly narrow down possibilities.  \nA common starting word that avoids CRANE’s letters is “SLIMY” (S, L, I, M, Y), or “DOUBT” (D, O, U, B, T).  \n\nI’ll choose “SLIMY” because it gives me three fresh consonants (S, L, M) plus one fresh vowel (I) and Y as a sometimes-vowel sometimes-consonant, maximizing information.\n\n<guess>SLIMY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SLIMY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) I(✓) M(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n- C, R, A, N, E, L, M, Y are all ruled out (they’ve shown up with “x”).\n- The secret word definitely contains S in position 1 and I in position 3: S _ I _ _\n- Remaining letters still allowed (and common): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z\n- We also know S and I already appear in their correct positions, so we need three more letters for positions 2, 4, and 5.\n\nI want to test several fresh, high-frequency consonants/vowels to narrow things down quickly.

Current constraints synthesized from all feedback:

1. Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, N, E, L, M, Y, G, H, T.
2. Positional certainties:
   - Position 1 must be S (✓ from both SLIMY and SIGHT).
   - Position 3 must be I (✓ from SLIMY).
   - In SIGHT the I is marked “-” – meaning the letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
     That seems to conflict with SLIMY’s I(✓) in position 3.  
     Re-reading: SLIMY says I(✓) so I is correct in position 3, therefore SIGHT’s I(-) is impossible.  
     The only way both can be true is that the feedback for SIGHT is a typo and should have I(✓).  
     Assuming the SLIMY feedback is authoritative, I will treat:
         - S _ I _ _  (S in 1, I in 3)  
         - Letters definitely out: C,R,A,N,E,L,M,Y,G,H,T.

3. Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out):  
   B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

4. Need to pick three more letters for positions 2, 4, 5, none of which can be any of the excluded letters.

5. Best next probe uses fresh high-frequency remaining consonants and vowels.  
   Among the remaining letters, B, D, F, K, O, P, U are common.  
   A word like S _ I _ _ that uses several of these quickly is desired.

   Candidate words:
   - SIPID  (but second P might not be ideal)
   - SIXTH  (but H and T are out)
   - SWORD  (O is allowed, W,R,D – but R is already out)
   - SPOOF  (P,O,F allowed, but double letters)
   - SFI**  – nothing common
   - SKIFF  – K and F are allowed
   - SUDIO  – but D and O allowed, ends in O
   - SUFID  – not a common word

   “SKIFF” is a valid 5-letter word, uses S,K,I,F,F.  
   K and F are fresh consonants not yet tested.  
   It keeps I in position 3 and S in position 1.

   Double F is acceptable (Wordle allows repeats, but we’ll see).

   Let me check a dictionary: SKIFF is indeed recognized.

   So I’ll guess SKIFF.
