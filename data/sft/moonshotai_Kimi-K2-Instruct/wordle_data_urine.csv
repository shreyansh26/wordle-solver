For the first guess, I want a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A popular strategy is to use words like ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"" because they contain common vowels and consonants. 

After considering options:
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E (good for vowels and common consonants)
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E (similar but swaps I for O)
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E (different consonant mix)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), providing a strong starting point for narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- I(✓): I is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 5).

So we know for sure:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Letters we must include: R (but not in position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5)
- Letters we can exclude: A, S
- Position constraints: R ≠ position 1

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A is out, and I/E are already placed).

A useful next guess will place the R somewhere other than position 1, and introduce new consonants/vowels to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- TRIBE: T R I B E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- PRIME: P R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- CRIME: C R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A popular strategy is to use words like ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"" because they contain common vowels and consonants. 

After considering options:
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E (good for vowels and common consonants)
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E (similar but swaps I for O)
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E (different consonant mix)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), providing a strong starting point for narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- I(✓): I is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 5).

So we know for sure:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Letters we must include: R (but not in position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5)
- Letters we can exclude: A, S
- Position constraints: R ≠ position 1

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A is out, and I/E are already placed).

A useful next guess will place the R somewhere other than position 1, and introduce new consonants/vowels to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- TRIBE: T R I B E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- PRIME: P R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- CRIME: C R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- DRIVE: D R I V E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- TRICE: T R I C E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2

I’ll choose TRIBE because it introduces T, B (both new letters) and places R in position 2.

We want a word that:

- Uses only allowed letters
- Introduces new letters to maximize information.

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting _ R I _ E:

1. PRIZE – but Z is possible but low-frequency; let’s try to use consonants we might see in common words.
2. GRIME – G and M are common; but B was ruled out, so M is still possible.
3. DRINK – does not fit pattern.

6. FRIED – D is allowed.
7. PRIED – P is allowed.
8. WRIER – double R, but R already in position 2.
9. ORIEL – has A (no), and L is allowed.
10. URIEL – has U.

I will choose ""PRIDE"" – it uses P and D, both new, and fits the pattern.

Wait, let me double-check:
- P: allowed (not banned)
- R: in position 2, correct

- Letters in the word: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, T, B, P, D, C, M (from all previous feedback)

Remaining letters for positions 1 & 4:
Allowed consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, N, V, W, X, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: O, U (A, I, E already placed or excluded)

We still need a 5-letter English word fitting “_ R I _ E” using only allowed letters.

Common remaining possibilities:
- FRIED – D excluded
- GRIKE – K allowed
- GRIDE – D excluded
- FRITE – T excluded
- ORIEL – O (position 1) and L (position 4) both allowed
- URIEL – U (position 1) and L (position 4) both allowed
- KRIME – K allowed, but M excluded
- FRISE – S excluded

Among these, “ORIEL” and “URIEL” are both valid, but “FRIKE” is not a standard English word. Let me double-check:
“ORIEL” is a recognized word (a type of window), and its letters O, R, I, E, L are all allowed.

So “ORIEL” fits the pattern and introduces new letters O and L while preserving the known positions. It also tests U if the word turns out to be “URIEL”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,urine,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A popular strategy is to use words like ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"" because they contain common vowels and consonants. 

After considering options:
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E (good for vowels and common consonants)
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E (similar but swaps I for O)
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E (different consonant mix)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), providing a strong starting point for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- I(✓): I is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 5).

So we know for sure:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Letters we must include: R (but not in position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5)
- Letters we can exclude: A, S
- Position constraints: R ≠ position 1

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A is out, and I/E are already placed).

A useful next guess will place the R somewhere other than position 1, and introduce new consonants/vowels to narrow things down.

Candidate words:
- TRIBE: T R I B E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- PRIME: P R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- CRIME: C R I M E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- DRIVE: D R I V E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2
- TRICE: T R I C E → fits _ _ I _ E and places R in position 2

I’ll choose TRIBE because it introduces T, B (both new letters) and places R in position 2.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRIBE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) B(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have:

- Pattern: _ R I _ E  (positions 2=R, 3=I, 5=E confirmed)
- Letters that appear: R, I, E
- Letters banned: A, S, T, B
- Position constraints: R cannot be in position 1 (from first guess), and we already know it’s in position 2 from the second guess, so no additional restriction.

Valid letters left for positions 1 and 4 (excluding the banned ones) include:
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O, U (since A and I are fixed).

We want a word that:
- Has the pattern _ R I _ E
- Uses only allowed letters
- Introduces new letters to maximize information.

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting _ R I _ E:

1. PRIZE – but Z is possible but low-frequency; let’s try to use consonants we might see in common words.
2. GRIME – G and M are common; but B was ruled out, so M is still possible.
3. DRINK – does not fit pattern.
4. FRISE – has S, banned.
5. CRIED – has D, common and not banned.
6. FRIED – D is allowed.
7. PRIED – P is allowed.
8. WRIER – double R, but R already in position 2.
9. ORIEL – has A (no), and L is allowed.
10. URIEL – has U.

I will choose ""PRIDE"" – it uses P and D, both new, and fits the pattern.

Wait, let me double-check:
- P: allowed (not banned)
- R: in position 2, correct
- I: in position 3, correct
- D: allowed
- E: in position 5, correct

""PRIDE"" fits perfectly.

3. PRIDE → P(x) R(✓) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)

Confirmed facts:
- Exact pattern: _ R I _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, S, T, B, P, D

Remaining candidate letters for the blanks:
- Position 1 (first): any letter except A, S, T, B, P, D
- Position 4 (fourth): any letter except those six plus R, I, E

Let’s list common consonants still possible: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels O, U.

We need a 5-letter English word fitting “_ R I _ E” and using only the allowed letters for positions 1 and 4.

Common words that fit:
- FRIED – D excluded (from PRIDE feedback)
- CRIED – D excluded
- GRIPE – P excluded
- CRIME – M allowed
- GRIME – M allowed
- FRIZE – Z possible but uncommon
- ORIEL – O allowed for position 1, L allowed for position 4
- URIEL – U allowed for position 1, L allowed for position 4
- KRIS? – no

Among these, “CRIME” and “GRIME” are both strong. Let me check their letters:
- CRIME: C (new), R (ok), I (ok), M (new), E (ok) → all allowed
- GRIME: G (new), R (ok), I (ok), M (new), E (ok) → all allowed

Since both are equally valid by the rules, I’ll choose CRIME (more frequent).
