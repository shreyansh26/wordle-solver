- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, a word like ""STARE"" contains S, T, A, R, E - which are five very common letters. This should give us good coverage to either confirm or eliminate several common letters early on.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E in position 5 (E ✓)
- There is an R somewhere, but not in position 4 (R -)
- S, T, A are not in the word at all.

Common letters we haven’t tested yet: I, O, N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, etc.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R, but not in position 4.
- Uses other untested common letters like I, O, N, L, etc.

A good candidate is ""OILER"":
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains R, but in position 3 (not 4).
- Uses O and I, which are common and untested so far.
- Uses L, another common letter.

From the feedback so far:

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(✓)
   - E is correct in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S, T, A are not in the word.

2. OILER → O(x) I(-) L(x) E(-) R(-)
   - O is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know E is in position 5 anyway).
   - R is in the word but not in position 5 (but we already know R is not in position 4 either).

So far we have:
- Letters not in the word: S, T, A, O, L.
- Letters known to be in the word: E (position 5), R (not position 4), I (not position 2).

The word ends with E and must contain R and I. R cannot be in position 4, and I cannot be in position 2.

Possible positions for R: 1, 2, 3 (since 4 and 5 are out)
Possible positions for I: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are out)

Let's think of words ending in E with R and I:
- R _ I _ E
- R _ _ I E
- _ R I _ E
- _ R _ I E
- I _ R _ E
- _ I R _ E

Looking at common letters we haven't used yet: N, D, U, Y, H, C, M, F, P, G, etc.

Let's try ""URINE"":
- U, R, I, N, E.
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains R and I.
- R is in position 2 (not 4, valid).
- I is in position 3 (not 2, valid).
- U and N are new common letters we haven't tested.
