Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains diverse letters to test multiple positions
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting word strategies often use words with:
- High frequency letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S
- Good mix of vowels and consonants
- No repeated letters

Popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S: common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common letter
- E: most common letter overall

This should give good coverage across different positions and letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains A, T, and E, but none of them are in their current positions (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively). Also, S and L are completely absent.

Since A, T, and E are present but misplaced, I need a new guess that:
1. Contains A, T, and E
2. Does NOT contain S or L
3. Places A, T, and E in different positions than before
4. Uses two new consonants that weren't in SLATE

Previous positions:
- A was in position 3
- T was in position 4
- E was in position 5

Possible new positions for A, T, E: positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 were used for T and E).

Let me try placing E first (since it's the most common letter), then T, then A, and fill in remaining spots with new consonants. Option: EAT??

But I need two more consonants not S or L. Common remaining consonants: R, N, M, C, etc.

How about EARTH? It has:
- E (previously position 5, now position 1)
- A (previously position 3, now position 2)
- T (previously position 4, now position 3)
- R and H are new consonants

Wait, does EARTH use any of the forbidden letters? No S or L, so it's okay.

Another option could be CRATE, but that uses C and R, and moves letters around.

EARTH seems good - it repositions all three known letters (E, A, T) and introduces R and H.

Current status:

Letters known to be in the word:
- E – now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A – now confirmed in position 2 (✓)
- T – still in the word but in the wrong position (-); note it was in position 4 in both SLATE and EARTH, so it must be in position 3 or 5.

Letters known to be absent:
- S, L, R, H

So the word pattern so far:
E A _ _ _   or   _ A _ _ _   (but E is confirmed at position 1, so pattern is E A _ _ _ )
And T must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. E A T _ _
2. E A _ T _
3. E A _ _ T

But pattern 2 (E A _ T _) would have T in position 4, which was already tried in SLATE (T was in position 4 and marked wrong), so T cannot be in position 4. Therefore only patterns 1 and 3 are possible:
- E A T _ _
- E A _ _ T

We need to fill in the remaining two positions with consonants that are NOT: S, L, R, H.

Consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick combinations that form common English words.

For pattern E A T _ _ :
- E A T E _  – but E is already used, and we can’t repeat letters unless allowed (Wordle typically allows repeats, but we have no info).
- E A T O _  – but O hasn’t been tested yet.
- E A T C H  – but H is excluded.
- E A T E N  – E is allowed to repeat? Let’s see: it’s common and E is confirmed once.

For pattern E A _ _ T :
- E A G E T – but G is untested, E may repeat.
- E A G E T  – seems plausible.
- E A M E T – M is untested.
- E A C T _ – but pattern must match E A _ _ T.
- E A C T _ won’t fit.

Looking at common words:
- E A T E N – matches E A T _ _, uses N (new), E is repeated.
- E A T E R – but R is excluded.
- E A G E T – but AGENT is more common (but that’s A G E N T, doesn’t fit).
- E A M U T – but MUT is not common.

Another option: E A S T _ – but S is excluded.

Actually, let’s think of common 5-letter words starting with EA and containing T once.
- E A T E N
- E A G E T – not a word.
- E A M U T – not a word.
- E A T O N – not a word.
- E A T E N seems the only plausible.

Let me check EATEN:
- E is in position 1 (matches ✓)
- A is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- T is in position 3 – was T in position 3 before? No, previously T was in 4 and 5 (but actually in SLATE T was 4, in EARTH T was 5), so position 3 is new.
- E is in position 4 – allowed to repeat, no info against it.
- N is new consonant.

This seems like a strong next guess.
