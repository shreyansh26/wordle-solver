For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters and is likely to give useful information. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. I'll pick ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help minimize the number of possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely (x): A, R, O, S, E, U, T, Y  
- Letters that appear in the word but in the wrong position (-): N and I

So the secret word:
1. Contains N and I somewhere.  
2. Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, Y.

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowels: only I (since A, E, O, U are out)

Since we must include both N and I, and we have five positions, we want a word that:
- Uses N and I (and possibly repeats I if necessary).  
- Uses only the allowed consonants above.

Candidate words that fit:
- BLIND – B, L, I, N, D – all allowed letters, contains I and N  
- CLINK – C, L, I, N, K – all allowed letters, contains I and N  
- FLING – F, L, I, N, G – all allowed letters, contains I and N  
- MINKY – Y is out, so discard  
- PIVOT – O, T are out, so discard  

Of these, “BLIND” is a good choice because it introduces three new consonants (B, L, D) and keeps I and N, giving maximum new information.

Therefore, I’ll guess BLIND.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all (marked x): A, R, O, S, E, U, T, Y, B, L, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are unknown (marked –): I and N

We still need to place both I and N somewhere inside the 5-letter secret word.  
All other letters must come only from the remaining alphabet that have never appeared in any feedback:  
C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

To maximize new information, pick a candidate that re-uses I and N plus three fresh consonants from the allowed set, and keeps both I and N so we can locate them.

Candidate words fitting these constraints:
- CHINK – I and N must be in it, but word has K/N/I/K, I and N appear, yet K repeats.  
- FINCH – F/I/N/C/H – uses I, N, and three new allowed letters.  
- GINCH – G/I/N/C/H – same idea.  
- PINCH – P/I/N/C/H – same idea.

""FINCH"" looks good: it contains I and N (already known), plus three entirely new consonants (F, C, H) that haven’t been tested yet.

Therefore, my next guess is FINCH.
