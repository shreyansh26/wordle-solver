For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and gives maximum information about the word's structure. The top starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After analyzing the most common letters in English words, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:

- A, R, O, S, E - which are among the most frequent letters in English
- Three vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give us good information about both vowel and consonant positions, helping narrow down future possibilities efficiently.

The feedback from AROSE:
- A (-) : the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R (-) : the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O (x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.
- S (x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.

So:
1. The word must contain both A and R, but neither is in its original position (positions 1 and 2).
2. The word must NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step:
- We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested.
- Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Vowels left: I and U (since A is already known to be present somewhere and O/E are ruled out).

A strong second guess mixes the known letters (A, R) with new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- It keeps A and R (both must be in different positions).
- Introduces T, I, N which are very common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids the eliminated letters (O, S, E).

However, let’s double-check:
- A is in AROSE and must move from position 1. In TRAIN, A is in position 3 – this is allowed.
- R is in AROSE and must move from position 2. In TRAIN, R is in position 2 – this is the SAME position, so this is NOT allowed. Thus, TRAIN is invalid because R would still be in position 2.

An alternative is “TRAIL”:
- A is in position 3 (moved from 1) – OK.
- R is in position 2 (same as original) – NOT OK (still invalid).

Next alternative is “RAISE” – but this contains S and E, which are eliminated.

Better choice: “DRAIN”:
- A is in position 3 – OK.
- R is in position 1 – OK (moved from position 2).
- D, I, N are new letters.

Thus, “DRAIN” is valid under the constraints.

But actually, “DRAIN” was just an example – let me think of a better word that maximizes new info. “FRAIL” has F, I, L (new letters), but F is less common. “GRAIN” has G, I, N – G is also less common.

“TRAIN” is invalid (R stays in position 2), but “TRAIN” is invalid as noted. Let me pick “CRANE” – but E is eliminated. “CRAMP” – P is not super common.

Best seems “DRAIN” or “GRAIN” or “BRAIN”.

“BRAIN”:
- B, R, A, I, N.
- A is in position 3 – OK (moved from 1).
- R is in position 2 – same as original – NOT OK (invalid).

“DRAIN”:
- A in 3 – OK, R in 1 – OK (moved from 2).

- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

We need a 5-letter word using only the allowed letters and placing A and R in valid spots.  
A good candidate should test new, frequent consonants. The remaining vowel left is U (A is already known).  
Try a word that puts A and R in possible positions while introducing other frequent letters.

Consider “MURAL”:
- Uses U (only remaining vowel) and common consonants M, L.  
- Check positions:  
  – A is in 4 (allowed)  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – Letters used are M, U, R, A, L – none are on the OUT list.

Therefore “MURAL” is a valid next guess.

The top starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After analyzing the most common letters in English words, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
- A (-) : the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R (-) : the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O (x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.
- S (x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.

So:
1. The word must contain both A and R, but neither is in its original position (positions 1 and 2).
2. The word must NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step:
- We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested.
- Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Vowels left: I and U (since A is already known to be present somewhere and O/E are ruled out).

A strong second guess mixes the known letters (A, R) with new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- It keeps A and R (both must be in different positions).
- Introduces T, I, N which are very common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids the eliminated letters (O, S, E).

However, let’s double-check:
- A is in AROSE and must move from position 1. In TRAIN, A is in position 3 – this is allowed.
- R is in AROSE and must move from position 2. In TRAIN, R is in position 2 – this is the SAME position, so this is NOT allowed. Thus, TRAIN is invalid because R would still be in position 2.

An alternative is “TRAIL”:
- A is in position 3 (moved from 1) – OK.
- R is in position 2 (same as original) – NOT OK (still invalid).

Next alternative is “RAISE” – but this contains S and E, which are eliminated.

Better choice: “DRAIN”:
- A is in position 3 – OK.
- R is in position 1 – OK (moved from position 2).
- D, I, N are new letters.

Thus, “DRAIN” is valid under the constraints.

But actually, “DRAIN” was just an example – let me think of a better word that maximizes new info. “FRAIL” has F, I, L (new letters), but F is less common. “GRAIN” has G, I, N – G is also less common.

“TRAIN” is invalid (R stays in position 2), but “TRAIN” is invalid as noted. Let me pick “CRANE” – but E is eliminated. “CRAMP” – P is not super common.

Best seems “DRAIN” or “GRAIN” or “BRAIN”.

“BRAIN”:
- B, R, A, I, N.
- A is in position 3 – OK (moved from 1).
- R is in position 2 – same as original – NOT OK (invalid).

“DRAIN”:
- A in 3 – OK, R in 1 – OK (moved from 2).
- D, I, N are new letters.

This seems the best choice among common words.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

2. DRAIN → D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

   - A is NOT in position 3 (from DRAIN) and NOT in position 1 (from AROSE).  
   - D, I, N are NOT in the word.

So far:
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, R  
- Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, D, I, N  
- Remaining candidate letters (common ones not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, Y  
- A must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3) → so A can be 2, 4, 5  
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

We need a 5-letter word using only the allowed letters and placing A and R in valid spots.  
A good candidate should test new, frequent consonants. The remaining vowel left is U (A is already known).  
Try a word that puts A and R in possible positions while introducing other frequent letters.

Consider “MURAL”:
- Uses U (only remaining vowel) and common consonants M, L.  
- Check positions:  
  – A is in 4 (allowed)

  – Letters used are M, U, R, A, L – none are on the OUT list.

Therefore “MURAL” is a valid next guess.

We now have three clues:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A and R are in the word but not in the positions shown (A≠1, R≠2).  
   ⇒ O, S, E are not in the word.

2. DRAIN → D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   ⇒ Confirms A and R are in the word, now we know:  
   - R is NOT in position 1 or 2.  
   - A is NOT in position 1 or 3.  
   ⇒ D, I, N are not in the word.

3. MURAL → M(x) U(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the correct position 3.  
   ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ M, U, L are not in the word.

Combining all constraints:

Letters IN the word: A, R (with R fixed at position 3).  
Letters OUT: O, S, E, D, I, N, M, U, L.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y.

Known positions:
- R is at 3.  
- A must be at 2 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, or 4).

We now need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining set, ensuring A is at 2 or 5.

Case 1: A at position 2  
Pattern: _ A R _ _  
Possible words: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y for positions 1, 4, 5.

Common letters: B, C, T are frequent.  
Possible words:  
- B A R _ _ → BARFY (Y allowed)  
- C A R _ _ → CART? but T is allowed, but need 5 letters.  
Looking at actual 5-letter words:  
- BARFY  
- BARKY  
- CARPY  
- CARBY  

Case 2: A at position 5  
Pattern: _ _ R _ A  
Possible words:  
- C R A C K? but C is repeated, and K is allowed.  
- B R A C A? but C and A repeated.  
- F R A C A? same issue.  
- T R A C A? same.  
Actually, valid 5-letter words:  
- BRAVA (but V is not in our allowed set)  
- CRACK (C repeated)  
- TRACK (T, R, A, C, K) – T, R, A, C, K are all allowed!  
But in TRACK, A is at 4, which is not allowed (A cannot be at 4 from MURAL feedback).  
So no valid word with A at 5 seems possible with remaining letters.

Thus, A must be at position 2.  

Best candidate from Case 1: BARFY (B, A, R, F, Y – all allowed letters, no repeats, positions valid).

Alternative: BARKY (but K and Y are allowed, but BARKY is valid).  
Between BARFY and BARKY, both are valid, but BARFY tests F and Y, BARKY tests K and Y.

   ⇒ M, U, L are not in the word.

Combining all constraints:

Letters IN the word: A, R (with R fixed at position 3).  
Letters OUT: O, S, E, D, I, N, M, U, L.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y.

Known positions:
- R is at 3.  
- A must be at 2 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, or 4).

We now need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining set, ensuring A is at 2 or 5.

Case 1: A at position 2  
Pattern: _ A R _ _  
Possible words: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y for positions 1, 4, 5.

Common letters: B, C, T are frequent.  
Possible words:  
- B A R _ _ → BARFY (Y allowed)  
- C A R _ _ → CART? but T is allowed, but need 5 letters.  
Looking at actual 5-letter words:  
- BARFY  
- BARKY  
- CARPY  
- CARBY  

Case 2: A at position 5  
Pattern: _ _ R _ A  
Possible words:  
- C R A C K? but C is repeated, and K is allowed.  
- B R A C A? but C and A repeated.  
- F R A C A? same issue.  
- T R A C A? same.  
Actually, valid 5-letter words:  
- BRAVA (but V is not in our allowed set)  
- CRACK (C repeated)  
- TRACK (T, R, A, C, K) – T, R, A, C, K are all allowed!  
But in TRACK, A is at 4, which is not allowed (A cannot be at 4 from MURAL feedback).  
So no valid word with A at 5 seems possible with remaining letters.

Thus, A must be at position 2.  

Best candidate from Case 1: BARFY (B, A, R, F, Y – all allowed letters, no repeats, positions valid).

Alternative: BARKY (but K and Y are allowed, but BARKY is valid).  
Between BARFY and BARKY, both are valid, but BARFY tests F and Y, BARKY tests K and Y.  

Choose BARFY.

The top starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After analyzing the most common letters in English words, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:

- A, R, O, S, E - which are among the most frequent letters in English
- Three vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This should give us good information about both vowel and consonant positions, helping narrow down future possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
- A (-) : the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R (-) : the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O (x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.
- S (x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.

So:
1. The word must contain both A and R, but neither is in its original position (positions 1 and 2).
2. The word must NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step:
- We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested.
- Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Vowels left: I and U (since A is already known to be present somewhere and O/E are ruled out).

A strong second guess mixes the known letters (A, R) with new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- It keeps A and R (both must be in different positions).
- Introduces T, I, N which are very common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids the eliminated letters (O, S, E).

However, let’s double-check:
- A is in AROSE and must move from position 1. In TRAIN, A is in position 3 – this is allowed.
- R is in AROSE and must move from position 2. In TRAIN, R is in position 2 – this is the SAME position, so this is NOT allowed. Thus, TRAIN is invalid because R would still be in position 2.

An alternative is “TRAIL”:
- A is in position 3 (moved from 1) – OK.
- R is in position 2 (same as original) – NOT OK (still invalid).

Next alternative is “RAISE” – but this contains S and E, which are eliminated.

Better choice: “DRAIN”:
- A is in position 3 – OK.
- R is in position 1 – OK (moved from position 2).
- D, I, N are new letters.

Thus, “DRAIN” is valid under the constraints.

But actually, “DRAIN” was just an example – let me think of a better word that maximizes new info. “FRAIL” has F, I, L (new letters), but F is less common. “GRAIN” has G, I, N – G is also less common.

“TRAIN” is invalid (R stays in position 2), but “TRAIN” is invalid as noted. Let me pick “CRANE” – but E is eliminated. “CRAMP” – P is not super common.

Best seems “DRAIN” or “GRAIN” or “BRAIN”.

“BRAIN”:
- B, R, A, I, N.
- A is in position 3 – OK (moved from 1).
- R is in position 2 – same as original – NOT OK (invalid).

“DRAIN”:
- A in 3 – OK, R in 1 – OK (moved from 2).
- D, I, N are new letters.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - A is NOT in position 3 (from DRAIN) and NOT in position 1 (from AROSE).  
   - D, I, N are NOT in the word.

So far:
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, R  
- Letters definitely OUT: O, S, E, D, I, N  
- Remaining candidate letters (common ones not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, Y  
- A must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3) → so A can be 2, 4, 5  
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)

We need a 5-letter word using only the allowed letters and placing A and R in valid spots.  
A good candidate should test new, frequent consonants. The remaining vowel left is U (A is already known).  
Try a word that puts A and R in possible positions while introducing other frequent letters.

Consider “MURAL”:
- Uses U (only remaining vowel) and common consonants M, L.  
- Check positions:  
  – A is in 4 (allowed)  
  – R is in 3 (allowed)  
  – Letters used are M, U, R, A, L – none are on the OUT list.

Therefore “MURAL” is a valid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have three clues:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A and R are in the word but not in the positions shown (A≠1, R≠2).  
   ⇒ O, S, E are not in the word.

   ⇒ Confirms A and R are in the word, now we know:  
   - R is NOT in position 1 or 2.  
   - A is NOT in position 1 or 3.  
   ⇒ D, I, N are not in the word.

3. MURAL → M(x) U(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ R is in the correct position 3.  
   ⇒ A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ M, U, L are not in the word.

Combining all constraints:

Letters IN the word: A, R (with R fixed at position 3).  
Letters OUT: O, S, E, D, I, N, M, U, L.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y.

Known positions:
- R is at 3.  
- A must be at 2 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, or 4).

We now need to fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining set, ensuring A is at 2 or 5.

Case 1: A at position 2  
Pattern: _ A R _ _  
Possible words: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y for positions 1, 4, 5.

Common letters: B, C, T are frequent.  
Possible words:  
- B A R _ _ → BARFY (Y allowed)  
- C A R _ _ → CART? but T is allowed, but need 5 letters.  
Looking at actual 5-letter words:  
- BARFY  
- BARKY  
- CARPY  
- CARBY  

Case 2: A at position 5  
Pattern: _ _ R _ A  
Possible words:  
- C R A C K? but C is repeated, and K is allowed.  
- B R A C A? but C and A repeated.  
- F R A C A? same issue.  
- T R A C A? same.  
Actually, valid 5-letter words:  
- BRAVA (but V is not in our allowed set)  
- CRACK (C repeated)  
- TRACK (T, R, A, C, K) – T, R, A, C, K are all allowed!  
But in TRACK, A is at 4, which is not allowed (A cannot be at 4 from MURAL feedback).  
So no valid word with A at 5 seems possible with remaining letters.

Thus, A must be at position 2.  

Best candidate from Case 1: BARFY (B, A, R, F, Y – all allowed letters, no repeats, positions valid).

Alternative: BARKY (but K and Y are allowed, but BARKY is valid).  
Between BARFY and BARKY, both are valid, but BARFY tests F and Y, BARKY tests K and Y.

- R(✓) – R is in position 3.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- Y(✓) – Y is in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A R _ Y

Letters already confirmed in word: A, R, Y  
Letters confirmed out: O, S, E, D, I, N, M, U, L, B, F

Remaining usable letters: C, G, H, K, P, T

We need a 5-letter word fitting: ? A R ? Y

Possible combinations:
- C A R C Y – double C, unlikely in Wordle list
- C A R G Y – C, A, R, G, Y – G allowed
- G A R R Y – double R
- H A R P Y – H, A, R, P, Y – all letters allowed
- H A R K Y – H, A, R, K, Y – all letters allowed
- P A R T Y – P, A, R, T, Y – all letters allowed

“HARP Y” is actually “H A R P Y” → “HARPY” – valid word
“HARKY” – not a standard word
“P A R T Y” → “PARTY” – very common word
“CARGY” – not a real word

Between “HARPY” and “PARTY”, “PARTY” is more common and uses T which is frequent, but both are valid. Since we want maximum coverage, “PARTY” is the safer pick.

Check positions:
- Position 1: P (allowed)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Position 4: T (allowed)
- Position 5: Y (correct)

This satisfies all constraints.

The top starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After analyzing the most common letters in English words, I\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n\n- A, R, O, S, E - which are among the most frequent letters in English\n- Three vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present\n- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words\n\nThis should give us good information about both vowel and consonant positions, helping narrow down future possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The feedback from AROSE:\n- A (-) : the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- R (-) : the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- O (x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.\n- S (x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.\n- E (x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.\n\nSo:\n1. The word must contain both A and R, but neither is in its original position (positions 1 and 2).\n2. The word must NOT contain O, S, or E.\n\nNext step:\n- We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested.\n- Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.\n- Vowels left: I and U (since A is already known to be present somewhere and O/E are ruled out).\n\nA strong second guess mixes the known letters (A, R) with new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:\n- It keeps A and R (both must be in different positions).\n- Introduces T, I, N which are very common letters not yet tested.\n- Avoids the eliminated letters (O, S, E).\n\nHowever, let’s double-check:\n- A is in AROSE and must move from position 1. In TRAIN, A is in position 3 – this is allowed.\n- R is in AROSE and must move from position 2. In TRAIN, R is in position 2 – this is the SAME position, so this is NOT allowed. Thus, TRAIN is invalid because R would still be in position 2.\n\nAn alternative is “TRAIL”:\n- A is in position 3 (moved from 1) – OK.\n- R is in position 2 (same as original) – NOT OK (still invalid).\n\nNext alternative is “RAISE” – but this contains S and E, which are eliminated.\n\nBetter choice: “DRAIN”:\n- A is in position 3 – OK.\n- R is in position 1 – OK (moved from position 2).\n- D, I, N are new letters.\n\nThus, “DRAIN” is valid under the constraints.\n\nBut actually, “DRAIN” was just an example – let me think of a better word that maximizes new info. “FRAIL” has F, I, L (new letters), but F is less common. “GRAIN” has G, I, N – G is also less common.\n\n“TRAIN” is invalid (R stays in position 2), but “TRAIN” is invalid as noted.

We now have the exact pattern:

_ A R _ Y

and these constraints:

- Letters already placed: A (pos 2), R (pos 3), Y (pos 5)
- Letters ruled out altogether:  
  O, S, E, D, I, N, M, U, L, B, F, P, T

Remaining legal letters:  
G, H, K, C

Only one place is left to fill – the first position – because the fourth position must be empty (we have five letters total and four are fixed).  
So the word is:

[G, H, K, C] A R _ Y

But the fourth letter must also be one of the remaining letters (G, H, K, C) and we still have only one letter left to choose (we have already used A, R, Y).  
The only 5-letter English words that fit are:

C A R C Y  – double C, not in word list  
C A R G Y  – C A R G Y (real word)  
H A R K Y  – not standard  
G A R R Y  – double R already used at 3  
K A R R Y  – double R already used at 3  
C A R K Y  – C A R K Y (real word)
