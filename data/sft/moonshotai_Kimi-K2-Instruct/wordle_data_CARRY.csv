1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE

These words use common letters like S, T, R, N, L, A, and E which appear in many 5-letter words. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good vowel balance.

- Contains **R** somewhere other than position 2.
- Contains **A** somewhere other than position 3.
- Does **not** contain **N** or **E**.

Good candidates:
- **C** R A _ _ → **C** A R _ _ (to move R out of position 2 and A out of position 3).  
  Possible: C A R D S (invalid, has N/E not checked yet, but also 6 letters).  
  Real 5-letter: C A R G O → checks all constraints.  
  Another: C A R V E → has E (invalid).  
  C A R P S → plural of carp, common word, no N/E.  

Let me confirm:
- Starts with C.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include:\n- SLATE\n- CRANE\n- STARE\n- ARISE\n\nThese words use common letters like S, T, R, N, L, A, and E which appear in many 5-letter words. I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good vowel balance.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From Guess 1 (CRANE → C✓ R- A- Nx Ex) we know:\n\n1.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: C (locked)
- Position 2: A (locked)
- Position 3: R (locked)
- Position 5: Y (locked)
- Position 4: L was tried and rejected → cannot be L.

So the pattern is fixed: C A R _ Y.

We need a letter for position 4 that is not any previously excluded letters:
- Excluded so far: N, E, P, S, L.

Remaining single-letter possibilities for position 4 (common in English words):
B, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, etc.

A common 5-letter word fitting: CAR + ? + Y:
- CARDY (but D is before R)
- CARRY (but R already used in position 3)
- CARGY (not a valid word)
- CARKY (carky isn’t standard)
- CARFY (not valid)
- CARMY (not standard)
- CARTY (tarty exists but not carty)
- CARVY (carvy is rare)

The most standard word among these is CARRY (even though R is repeated, it’s allowed). However, since R is already in position 3, and words can repeat letters unless explicitly ruled out, CARRY is valid.

Double-check: C A R R Y:
- No N, E, P, S, L.
- All positions match the locked letters: C✓ A✓ R✓ ? R? Y✓
- Specifically, position 4 is R, which is allowed since R is confirmed in the word.

This seems the only common word fitting the fixed pattern.
