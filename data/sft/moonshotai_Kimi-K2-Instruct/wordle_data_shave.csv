For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE - uses very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE - also uses common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU - uses many vowels
- STARE - good balance of consonants and vowels

I'll choose CRANE because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, E which are all very common in English words. The letter distribution is good: one common vowel (A), one less common vowel (E), and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give me good feedback about which letters might be in the secret word.

Known positions:  
- A is fixed at position 3 (✓)  
- E is NOT at 2 or 5 (CRANE and HEATS both gave E(-) for those positions)  
- H is NOT at 1, 3, 5 (PEACH and HEATS gave H(-) for 5 and 1) — so H must be at 2 or 4  
- S is NOT at 5 (HEATS gave S(-) for 5) — so S must be at 1, 2, or 4  

Letters excluded so far: C, R, N, P, T  

Current pattern: _ _ A _ _ with {E, H, S} still to place.

Possible placements:
- H must be at 2 or 4  
- S must be at 1, 2, or 4  
- E must be at 1, 2, or 4 (but cannot conflict with H and S)  

Let’s try to place H at 4 first (since 2 overlaps with possible S positions):

If H is at 4, then positions left are 1, 2, 5 for E and S, but S cannot be at 5. So:

Option 1: H at 4  
Then S must be at 1 or 2, and E must occupy the remaining spot.  
Possible words:  
- S E A H _ → but need a 5th letter not yet excluded  
- E S A H _  

Looking for real words:  
SEASH – not valid  
LEASH – L not tested yet, and we haven’t used L  
YEASH – not valid  
So SEAH_ might not give a valid word.

Option 2: H at 2  
Then positions left: 1, 4, 5 for E and S, with S not at 5.  
Possible placements:  
- S at 1, E at 4 or 5 (but E cannot be at 5 from CRANE) → E at 4  
- E at 1, S at 4  

Testing words:  
- S H A E _ → SHA_E → SHAKE (K not excluded)  
- E H A S _ → not a valid word  

So SHAKE seems promising:  
- S at 1 (allowed)  
- H at 2 (allowed)  
- A at 3 (fixed)  
- E at 4 (not excluded)  
- K at 5 (not tested yet)  

All constraints satisfied.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,shave,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE - uses very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE - also uses common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU - uses many vowels
- STARE - good balance of consonants and vowels

I'll choose CRANE because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, E which are all very common in English words. The letter distribution is good: one common vowel (A), one less common vowel (E), and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give me good feedback about which letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 3 is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (✓) — so E is somewhere but not at position 5

So we know:
- The word has A in the middle ( _ _ A _ _ )
- It contains E somewhere other than position 5
- It does NOT contain C, R, N
- It may or may not contain A or E elsewhere (but we already know A is fixed at position 3)

Good next guess should use new common consonants and test placement of E. Good candidates:
- SLATE (but we should avoid S L A T E since A is already confirmed at position 3)
- BEAST (but this uses S, which is okay, and tests E at position 2)
- PEACH (tests P, E at position 2, H)
- LEANT (but N is already excluded)
- HEAPS (tests H, E at position 1, P, S)

I'll go with PEACH as it introduces P, H and tests E at position 2.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PEACH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) A(✓) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, P  
2. Position 3 is definitely A (✓)  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   – E (it appeared in both guesses, always marked ✓/-, never x)  
   – H (first appears in PEACH, marked -, so it’s somewhere but not at position 5)  
4. Letters we have not tested yet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

The missing letters E and H must occupy two of the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) with the constraint that:
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE feedback)
- H is not in position 5 (from PEACH feedback)

A good third guess should:
- Place E and H in new candidate positions  
- Introduce several new, common consonants  
- Re-use A at position 3 (already fixed)  

Possibilities:  
- HEADS  → but S not yet tested  
- HEATH  → repeats H, not ideal  
- MEATH  → M, T, H placements  
- LEASH  → L, S, H placements  

I’ll pick MEATH because it places E at position 2, tests H at 5 (but we know H can’t be at 5, so that’ll confirm H must be 1 or 4), and adds common letters M and T.

(Wait: feedback on PEACH said H(-), meaning H is in the word but NOT at position 5. So H must be at 1, 2, or 4. Putting H at 5 would give H(x), which we don’t want.)  

Alternative: HEATS — places H at 1, E at 2, and tests S at 5. That’s better: H(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), S(5).  

Yes, HEATS uses all new consonants except A, and checks E at 2, H at 1.

Looking for real words:  
SEASH – not valid  
LEASH – L not tested yet, and we haven’t used L  
YEASH – not valid  
So SEAH_ might not give a valid word.

Option 2: H at 2  
Then positions left: 1, 4, 5 for E and S, with S not at 5.  
Possible placements:  
- S at 1, E at 4 or 5 (but E cannot be at 5 from CRANE) → E at 4  
- E at 1, S at 4  

Testing words:  
- S H A E _ → SHA_E → SHAKE (K not excluded)  
- E H A S _ → not a valid word  

So SHAKE seems promising:  
- S at 1 (allowed)

- K at 5 (not tested yet)

So the secret word is now fully determined: positions 1-5 are S H A _ E and the missing letter at position 4 must be a letter we have not yet excluded.

Letters known to be excluded so far: C, R, N, P, T, K

Common valid words fitting SHA_E:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,shave,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE - uses very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE - also uses common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU - uses many vowels
- STARE - good balance of consonants and vowels

I'll choose CRANE because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, E which are all very common in English words. The letter distribution is good: one common vowel (A), one less common vowel (E), and three common consonants (C, R, N). This should give me good feedback about which letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 3 is A
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (✓) — so E is somewhere but not at position 5

So we know:
- The word has A in the middle ( _ _ A _ _ )
- It contains E somewhere other than position 5
- It does NOT contain C, R, N
- It may or may not contain A or E elsewhere (but we already know A is fixed at position 3)

Good next guess should use new common consonants and test placement of E. Good candidates:
- SLATE (but we should avoid S L A T E since A is already confirmed at position 3)
- BEAST (but this uses S, which is okay, and tests E at position 2)
- PEACH (tests P, E at position 2, H)
- LEANT (but N is already excluded)
- HEAPS (tests H, E at position 1, P, S)

I'll go with PEACH as it introduces P, H and tests E at position 2.

<guess>PEACH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PEACH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) A(✓) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, P  
2. Position 3 is definitely A (✓)  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   – E (it appeared in both guesses, always marked ✓/-, never x)  
   – H (first appears in PEACH, marked -, so it’s somewhere but not at position 5)  
4. Letters we have not tested yet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

The missing letters E and H must occupy two of the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) with the constraint that:
- E is not in position 5 (from CRANE feedback)
- H is not in position 5 (from PEACH feedback)

A good third guess should:
- Place E and H in new candidate positions  
- Introduce several new, common consonants  
- Re-use A at position 3 (already fixed)  

Possibilities:  
- HEADS  → but S not yet tested  
- HEATH  → repeats H, not ideal  
- MEATH  → M, T, H placements  
- LEASH  → L, S, H placements  

I’ll pick MEATH because it places E at position 2, tests H at 5 (but we know H can’t be at 5, so that’ll confirm H must be 1 or 4), and adds common letters M and T.

(Wait: feedback on PEACH said H(-), meaning H is in the word but NOT at position 5. So H must be at 1, 2, or 4. Putting H at 5 would give H(x), which we don’t want.)  

Alternative: HEATS — places H at 1, E at 2, and tests S at 5. That’s better: H(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), S(5).  

Yes, HEATS uses all new consonants except A, and checks E at 2, H at 1.

<guess>HEATS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PEACH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) A(✓) C(x) H(-)
Guess 3: HEATS -> FEEDBACK: H(-) E(-) A(✓) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Known letters in the word: A, E, H, S  
Known positions:  
- A is fixed at position 3 (✓)  
- E is NOT at 2 or 5 (CRANE and HEATS both gave E(-) for those positions)  
- H is NOT at 1, 3, 5 (PEACH and HEATS gave H(-) for 5 and 1) — so H must be at 2 or 4  
- S is NOT at 5 (HEATS gave S(-) for 5) — so S must be at 1, 2, or 4  

Letters excluded so far: C, R, N, P, T  

Current pattern: _ _ A _ _ with {E, H, S} still to place.

Possible placements:
- H must be at 2 or 4  
- S must be at 1, 2, or 4  
- E must be at 1, 2, or 4 (but cannot conflict with H and S)  

Let’s try to place H at 4 first (since 2 overlaps with possible S positions):

If H is at 4, then positions left are 1, 2, 5 for E and S, but S cannot be at 5. So:

Option 1: H at 4  
Then S must be at 1 or 2, and E must occupy the remaining spot.  
Possible words:  
- S E A H _ → but need a 5th letter not yet excluded  
- E S A H _  

Looking for real words:  
SEASH – not valid  
LEASH – L not tested yet, and we haven’t used L  
YEASH – not valid  
So SEAH_ might not give a valid word.

Option 2: H at 2  
Then positions left: 1, 4, 5 for E and S, with S not at 5.  
Possible placements:  
- S at 1, E at 4 or 5 (but E cannot be at 5 from CRANE) → E at 4  
- E at 1, S at 4  

Testing words:  
- S H A E _ → SHA_E → SHAKE (K not excluded)  
- E H A S _ → not a valid word  

So SHAKE seems promising:  
- S at 1 (allowed)  
- H at 2 (allowed)  
- A at 3 (fixed)  
- E at 4 (not excluded)  
- K at 5 (not tested yet)  

All constraints satisfied.

Letters known to be excluded so far: C, R, N, P, T, K  
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, H, A, E  
Letter not yet confirmed or excluded for position 4: any other consonant (e.g., B, D, F, G, L, M, Q, etc.)

But we know the word must be a valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern SHA_E.

Common valid words fitting SHA_E:
- SHAPE
- SHADE
- SHARE
- SHALE
- SHAME
- SHAVE
- SHANE (proper noun, less likely)
- SHAKE (already used)

From these, we can check which letters are still unexcluded:
- SHAPE: P is excluded (from PEACH), so cannot be SHAPE
- SHADE: D is not excluded
- SHARE: R is excluded (from CRANE), so cannot be SHARE
- SHALE: L is not excluded
- SHAME: M is not excluded
- SHAVE: V is not excluded

Thus possible candidates: SHADE, SHALE, SHAME, SHAVE.

We now know the exact positions:

S H A _ E

And we have eliminated these letters for position 4:  
C, R, N, P, T, K, D

The remaining most common consonants are L, M, V, G, B, F, etc.  
The only common English word of the form “SHA_E” that hasn’t been ruled out is:

SHAME  (M is still allowed)

If SHAME is wrong, the next best guess would be SHAVE, but let’s check SHAME first.
