For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English and provides good coverage to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Other good options include ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but I'll go with SLATE as it gives me great coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- A is in the correct position (third letter).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).
- L and T are NOT in the word at all.

So we already know the word is in the form: S _ A _ E, and the letters L and T are excluded.

Now I need to pick two new consonants for positions 2 and 4. Since L and T are out, I should choose other common consonants not yet tried, such as R, N, D, C, etc.

Trying to maximize information I’ll pick two distinct new consonants. A good candidate is “SHARE”:
- S ✓ already confirmed
- H new letter
- A ✓ already confirmed
- R new letter
- E ✓ already confirmed

This tests H and R for positions 2 and 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English and provides good coverage to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Other good options include ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but I'll go with SLATE as it gives me great coverage of common letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- A is in the correct position (third letter).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).
- L and T are NOT in the word at all.

So we already know the word is in the form: S _ A _ E, and the letters L and T are excluded.

Now I need to pick two new consonants for positions 2 and 4. Since L and T are out, I should choose other common consonants not yet tried, such as R, N, D, C, etc.

Trying to maximize information I’ll pick two distinct new consonants. A good candidate is “SHARE”:
- S ✓ already confirmed
- H new letter
- A ✓ already confirmed
- R new letter
- E ✓ already confirmed

This tests H and R for positions 2 and 4.

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4.  
- Position 2: cannot be L, T, R or H (but H is in the word, so it must be placed elsewhere—however position 2 is taken by a letter that isn’t H).  
Common remaining consonants: N, D, C, B, G, M, P, etc.

- Position 4: cannot be L, T, R.  
Common remaining consonants: same set.

I’ll choose a word that uses two new consonants for positions 2 and 4, maximizing information.  
A good candidate is “SPACE”:  
- S ✓ (1)  
- P (new for position 2)  
- A ✓ (3)  
- C (new for position 4)

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Therefore H must be in position 4, giving the form S _ A H E.

The only remaining letter to determine is position 2.
Valid consonants remaining (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the common ones most likely are B, D, G, K, M, N.

I’ll test G for position 2: “S A G H E” → SAGHE is invalid (not a word).
Testing N: SNAHE is invalid.
Testing M: SMAHE is invalid.
Testing K: SKAHE is invalid.
Testing D: SDAHE is invalid.
Testing B: SBAHE is invalid.
Testing N: SNAHE is invalid.

Wait — the only actual common English word that fits is SHADE, but D is not ruled out yet.
Let me check: S H A D E
- H is confirmed in word, must be position 2 (since position 4 must be a consonant, but H cannot be in position 2 because SHARE feedback said H is in wrong position? Wait no, re-read:

SHARE feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(x) E(✓) — this means H is in correct position (position 2).

So the word is S H A _ E.

The only remaining letter is position 4, which must be a consonant not yet ruled out (i.e., not L, T, R, P, C).

Common consonants left: D, K, M, N.

Now test possible words:
- SHADE: uses D (valid)
- SHAKE: uses K (valid)
- SHAME: uses M (valid)
- SHANE: uses N (valid)

All four are actual English words. I need to pick one to test.

I’ll choose a consonant that appears most commonly in this spot. D is very common here, so I’ll test SHADE.

Positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked: S, H, A, E.  
Position 4 must be a consonant that has NOT yet been ruled out.

Letters already eliminated from the entire word: L, T, R, P, C, D.  
Remaining consonants for position 4: B, F, G, K, M, N, V, W, Y, Z (and a few rarer ones).

We need a legitimate 5-letter English word that fits S H A ? E.

Common real words:
- SHALE – but L is already out.  
- SHAME – M not yet ruled out.  
- SHAPE – P is already out.  
- SHARE – R is already out.  
- SHAKE – K not yet ruled out.  
- SHAVE – V not yet ruled out.  
- SHANE – proper noun, less likely as Wordle answer.  
- SHANK – fits.  

Among the high-frequency consonants, K and M are the most plausible.

Let me test SHAKE for position 4 = K.

If feedback comes back with (✓) for K, we win; if (x) we eliminate K and can then test SHAME or SHAVE next.
