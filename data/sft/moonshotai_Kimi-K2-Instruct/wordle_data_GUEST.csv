For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, C, and R, while vowels like A, E, I, O, U are essential to test early. 

A strong starting word should use as many unique letters as possible to cover more of the alphabet. One of the best statistically optimal first guesses is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall in English)

This gives us good coverage and will provide information about 5 distinct letters right away.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains S, T, E.
- The word does NOT contain L, A.
- S cannot be in position 1.
- T cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We also know letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters (S, T, E) in new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid L and A.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5 (since it can't be 1)
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5 (since it can't be 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (since it can't be 5)

Good candidates might be:
- STREP (but P is less common)
- STONE (O and N are good, but E is already known)
- STEIN (good vowel I)
- STOKE (O and K are good)
- STORE (O and R are good)

""STORE"" seems strong because:
- Moves S to position 2 (new position)
- Keeps T in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces R and O (common letters)
- Keeps E in position 5 (but E can't be 5 - so this is bad)

Wait, E can't be position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Looking at STEIN:
- S in 1 (invalid, can't be 1)
- So STEIN is invalid.

Looking at STOKE:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- So STOKE is invalid.

Looking at ESTER:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- S in 2 (allowed)

This uses known letters in new positions and adds R.

- STOKE (O and K are good)
- STORE (O and R are good)

""STORE"" seems strong because:
- Moves S to position 2 (new position)
- Keeps T in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces R and O (common letters)
- Keeps E in position 5 (but E can't be 5 - so this is bad)

Wait, E can't be position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Looking at STEIN:
- S in 1 (invalid, can't be 1)
- So STEIN is invalid.

Looking at STOKE:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- So STOKE is invalid.

Looking at ESTER:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- S in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- R is new
This uses known letters in new positions and adds R.

Another option is ""TRIES"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- R new
- I new vowel
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
This looks better as it adds R and I.

A good next guess should:
1. place S, T, E in new allowed positions,
2. introduce two new common letters that have not appeared yet.

Looking at common remaining letters, N, O, U, C, D, M, K are attractive.  
Let’s try a word that uses S, T, E in fresh slots and adds two of those:

Consider “NOTES”:

- 1: E or a new letter  
- 2: E or S  
- 3: S or T  
- 4: new letter  
- 5: T or new letter  

Observations  
- E, S, T together must occupy three different positions, respecting the above rules.  
- The other two positions must be filled by untested letters.

We need a guess that
1. Puts E, S, T in the still-allowed slots;
2. Introduces two common, still-untested letters;
3. Uses no already-eliminated letters.

Let’s assign:
- E to position 1 (it is allowed there).  
- S to position 2 (allowed).  
- T to position 5 (allowed).  
- Positions 3 and 4 need new letters.  
Popular unused consonants: C, D, M, K, P, U…

A word that satisfies this exactly is “E S T _ _”.  
With C and K in the remaining slots we get “E S T C K” → invalid (no such word).  
With C and P we get “E S C P T” → “SECTP”? No.

Reverse the order of unknown letters: “E S _ _ T”  
Try C and K: “E S C K T”? No.  
Try C and P: “E S C P T”? No.

How about “S” at position 3, not 2?  
Then E must be at 2 (cannot be 3).  
T can now only be at 5 (cannot be at 3 if S is there).  
Structure: _ E S _ T  
Fill blanks with new letters.

Let’s list candidate 5-letter words that
- Contain exactly the known letters E, S, T  
- Use two of the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  
- Respect positional constraints.

After checking common words, “PESTY” pops up (P, E, S, T, Y) but Y is unused.  
Check constraints:
P: untested – OK  
E: can be in position 2 – OK  
S: can be in position 3 – OK  
T: can be in position 4 – BUT the feedback says T is NOT in 4.  
So “PESTY” is invalid because of T in 4.

Next word: “PESTO” – but O is already eliminated (from NOTES).  
Next: “UPSET” – letters U, P, S, E, T  
Check positions:
U: untested – OK  
P: untested – OK  
S: position 4 – allowed (only forbidden: 1,5)  
E: position 2 – allowed  
T: position 5 – allowed  
No eliminated letters used.

“UPSET” satisfies every constraint.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We now have an extra confirmed placement:
- T is in the correct spot: position 5.

Re-summarising the constraints for the remaining letters:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S – may not be in positions 1, 4, 5  → must be 2 or 3  
- E – may not be in positions 3, 4, 5  → must be 1 or 2  
- T – locked in position 5  

Letters never in the word (from earlier feedback + P):
L, A, R, I, N, O, P  

Untested letters (still could fill positions 3 and 4):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  (note: U was tested and in wrong positions)

Word skeleton so far:
? ? ? ? T

With:
- E must be 1 or 2  
- S must be 2 or 3  

Both E and S must occupy slots 1, 2, 3.  
To avoid conflict:
- If E is in position 1, S can be in 2 or 3.  
- If E is in position 2, S must be in 3 (because E is already in 2).

So possible patterns:
1. E S _ _ T
2. E _ S _ T
3. _ E S _ T

We need to fill the two blanks with two distinct untested letters.

Popular remaining consonants: C, D, M, K, G, B, F, H…

Let’s pick a common pair that makes a valid word.

Option 1: E S _ _ T
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.
Try E S C K T → not a word.
E S H C T → “ESCHT” not in dictionary.

Option 2: E _ S _ T
Try E D S K T → “EDSKT” no.
E G S M T → no.

Option 3: _ E S _ T
Try B E S E T – but E already used twice (only allowed once).
D E S K T → “DESKT” no.
C E S T _ – wait, 5 letters: C E S T ? – but T is fixed at 5, so C E S _ T → CES?T
CESKT? no. CESTH? no.

Real word check:
From dictionary lookup, a valid English word that fits:
B E S E T → double E not possible (only one E in the word).
Actual valid word: “BEST” + T → but four letters.

Another:
G E S T ? – we need 5 letters.

E S C M T – “ESCMT” no.

Let me step back and use a fresh pair of unused letters.
Try “H” and “M”:
E S H M T – no.
E H S M T – no.
H E S M T – no.

Let me run through a quick list of real 5-letter words ending in T that contain {E,S} elsewhere and no eliminated letters.

Valid candidates:
- “CHEST” – C, H are untested. Check constraints:
  C: untested – OK  
  H: untested – OK  
  E: position 2 – allowed

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,GUEST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, C, and R, while vowels like A, E, I, O, U are essential to test early. 

A strong starting word should use as many unique letters as possible to cover more of the alphabet. One of the best statistically optimal first guesses is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall in English)

This gives us good coverage and will provide information about 5 distinct letters right away.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains S, T, E.
- The word does NOT contain L, A.
- S cannot be in position 1.
- T cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We also know letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Use the known letters (S, T, E) in new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid L and A.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5 (since it can't be 1)
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5 (since it can't be 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (since it can't be 5)

Good candidates might be:
- STREP (but P is less common)
- STONE (O and N are good, but E is already known)
- STEIN (good vowel I)
- STOKE (O and K are good)
- STORE (O and R are good)

""STORE"" seems strong because:
- Moves S to position 2 (new position)
- Keeps T in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces R and O (common letters)
- Keeps E in position 5 (but E can't be 5 - so this is bad)

Wait, E can't be position 5, so STORE is invalid.

Looking at STEIN:
- S in 1 (invalid, can't be 1)
- So STEIN is invalid.

Looking at STOKE:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- So STOKE is invalid.

Looking at ESTER:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- S in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- R is new
This uses known letters in new positions and adds R.

Another option is ""TRIES"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- R new
- I new vowel
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
This looks better as it adds R and I.

Let's go with TRIES.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their forbidden positions (so far):
- S: not in position 1 or 5
- T: not in position 1 or 4
- E: not in position 4 or 5

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- L, A, R, I

Letters we still don’t know about:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

So the mystery word contains S, T, E plus two more letters chosen only from the “unknown” list above, and:
- S: may only be in positions 2, 3, 4
- T: may only be in positions 2, 3, 5
- E: may only be in positions 1, 2, 3

A good next guess should:
1. place S, T, E in new allowed positions,
2. introduce two new common letters that have not appeared yet.

Looking at common remaining letters, N, O, U, C, D, M, K are attractive.  
Let’s try a word that uses S, T, E in fresh slots and adds two of those:

Consider “NOTES”:
- N, O are new letters.
- T is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).

All constraints are satisfied.

Known facts

- Letters **never** in the word (from feedback)
  L, A, R, I, N, O

- Untested letters (still could appear):  
  B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Word structure so far  
Positions: 1  2  3  4  5  
- 1: E or a new letter  
- 2: E or S  
- 3: S or T  
- 4: new letter  
- 5: T or new letter  

Observations  
- E, S, T together must occupy three different positions, respecting the above rules.  
- The other two positions must be filled by untested letters.

We need a guess that
1. Puts E, S, T in the still-allowed slots;
2. Introduces two common, still-untested letters;
3. Uses no already-eliminated letters.

Let’s assign:
- E to position 1 (it is allowed there).  
- S to position 2 (allowed).  
- T to position 5 (allowed).  
- Positions 3 and 4 need new letters.  
Popular unused consonants: C, D, M, K, P, U…

A word that satisfies this exactly is “E S T _ _”.  
With C and K in the remaining slots we get “E S T C K” → invalid (no such word).  
With C and P we get “E S C P T” → “SECTP”? No.

Reverse the order of unknown letters: “E S _ _ T”  
Try C and K: “E S C K T”? No.  
Try C and P: “E S C P T”? No.

How about “S” at position 3, not 2?  
Then E must be at 2 (cannot be 3).  
T can now only be at 5 (cannot be at 3 if S is there).  
Structure: _ E S _ T  
Fill blanks with new letters.  
Choose C and K: C E S K T → “CESTK”? No.  
Choose D and Y: D E S Y T → “DESYT”? No.

Try another pattern:  
Put E at 1, S at 3, T at 5 ⇒ E _ S _ T  
Fill with C, K: E C S K T → “ECSKT”? No.  
Fill with D, K: E D S K T → “EDSKT”? No.

Try U and P: E U S P T → “EUSPT”? No.

Need real English word.  
Let’s list candidate 5-letter words that
- Contain exactly the known letters E, S, T  
- Use two of the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  
- Respect positional constraints.

After checking common words, “PESTY” pops up (P, E, S, T, Y) but Y is unused.  
Check constraints:
P: untested – OK  
E: can be in position 2 – OK  
S: can be in position 3 – OK  
T: can be in position 4 – BUT the feedback says T is NOT in 4.  
So “PESTY” is invalid because of T in 4.

Next word: “PESTO” – but O is already eliminated (from NOTES).  
Next: “UPSET” – letters U, P, S, E, T  
Check positions:
U: untested – OK  
P: untested – OK  
S: position 4 – allowed (only forbidden: 1,5)  
E: position 2 – allowed  
T: position 5 – allowed  
No eliminated letters used.

“UPSET” satisfies every constraint.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: NOTES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have an extra confirmed placement:
- T is in the correct spot: position 5.

Re-summarising the constraints for the remaining letters:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S – may not be in positions 1, 4, 5  → must be 2 or 3  
- E – may not be in positions 3, 4, 5  → must be 1 or 2  
- T – locked in position 5  

Letters never in the word (from earlier feedback + P):
L, A, R, I, N, O, P  

Untested letters (still could fill positions 3 and 4):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  (note: U was tested and in wrong positions)

Word skeleton so far:
? ? ? ? T

With:
- E must be 1 or 2  
- S must be 2 or 3  

Both E and S must occupy slots 1, 2, 3.  
To avoid conflict:
- If E is in position 1, S can be in 2 or 3.  
- If E is in position 2, S must be in 3 (because E is already in 2).

So possible patterns:
1. E S _ _ T
2. E _ S _ T
3. _ E S _ T

We need to fill the two blanks with two distinct untested letters.

Popular remaining consonants: C, D, M, K, G, B, F, H…

Let’s pick a common pair that makes a valid word.

Option 1: E S _ _ T
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4.
Try E S C K T → not a word.
E S H C T → “ESCHT” not in dictionary.

Option 2: E _ S _ T
Try E D S K T → “EDSKT” no.
E G S M T → no.

Option 3: _ E S _ T
Try B E S E T – but E already used twice (only allowed once).
D E S K T → “DESKT” no.
C E S T _ – wait, 5 letters: C E S T ? – but T is fixed at 5, so C E S _ T → CES?T
CESKT? no. CESTH? no.

Real word check:
From dictionary lookup, a valid English word that fits:
B E S E T → double E not possible (only one E in the word).
Actual valid word: “BEST” + T → but four letters.

Another:
G E S T ? – we need 5 letters.

Let me instead generate systematically:
Pattern _ E S _ T
Fill with C, K → C E S K T – “CESKT” no.
D, K → D E S K T – “DESKT” no.
F, K → F E S K T – “FESKT” no.
M, K → M E S K T – “MESKT” no.

Pattern E S _ _ T
Fill C, K → E S C K T – “ESCKT” no.
E S C M T – “ESCMT” no.

Pattern E _ S _ T
E C S K T – “ECSKT” no.

Let me step back and use a fresh pair of unused letters.
Try “H” and “M”:
E S H M T – no.
E H S M T – no.
H E S M T – no.

Let me run through a quick list of real 5-letter words ending in T that contain {E,S} elsewhere and no eliminated letters.

Valid candidates:
- “CHEST” – C, H are untested. Check constraints:
  C: untested – OK  
  H: untested – OK  
  E: position 2 – allowed  
  S: position 3 – allowed  
  T: position 5 – confirmed ✓  
  No forbidden letters used.

This satisfies every rule.

Hence, next guess: CHEST

So the word ends in “E S T” and we only need to discover positions 1 and 2.

Letters not in the word (from previous feedback):
L, A, R, I, N, O, P, C, H, U

Available letters (still untested):
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a real 5-letter word that
- begins with two letters from the available set,
- has “E S T” in positions 3-4-5.

Common English words that fit “??EST”:
- BEST  (B and E, but E already used)
- WEST  (W and E, same issue)
- GEST? no
- FEST? uncommon
- MEST? no
- VEST  (V and E – E already used)
- ZEST  (Z and E – E already used)
- JEST  (J, E – E used)
- D, K, F, G, B, M could pair with another letter.

Real word list:
- B E S T  – but we need 5 letters and E already placed.
Wait – “B E S T” is 4 letters. We need 5.

The only common 5-letter English word fitting “??EST” is “GUESS” – but it doesn’t fit.

Rechecking – we need 5-letter words ending in “EST” with two fresh letters in 1-2.
- BLEST
- DREST
- FLEST – no
- GLEST – no
- PREST – P eliminated
- TREST – T already used
- WREST – W, R – R eliminated

Wait, “BLEST” is a valid variant of “blessed”.

Its letters:
B, L, E, S, T  
But L is already eliminated.

“DREST” – D, R, E, S, T – R eliminated.

“FLEST” – not a word.

“GUEST” – U eliminated.

“QUEST” – Q, U, E, S, T – U eliminated.

“ZESTY” – ends Y, not T.

Rechecking dictionary for 5-letter words ending in “E S T” and containing only the allowed letters in positions 1-2.

The only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is “GUEST” but U is eliminated.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter English words that end in “EST” and whose first two letters are from the remaining set:

Allowed first two letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Real words found:
- BEST  (4 letters only)
- VEST  (4 letters)
- ZEST  (4 letters)
- JEST  (4 letters)
- GEST  (4 letters)
- WEST  (4 letters)

None of these are 5 letters.

I realize I missed “BLEST” – but it has L which is out.

Next possible valid 5-letter word: “DREST” – but R is out.

“FLEST” – F and L – L out.

“GREST” – R out.

“KREST” – R out.

“MREST” – R out.

“YREST” – R out.

“BREST” – R out.

“WREST” – R out.

“QREST” – R out.

“ZREST” – R out.

“JREST” – R out.

“XREST” – R out.

There is **no common English 5-letter word** left that ends in “E S T” and only uses the remaining untested letters in positions 1-2.

I must have missed earlier. The only valid word left is “BESET” – but E is already used and P is out.

Rechecking feedback carefully:

From Guess 5: CHEST → C(x) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓)

So positions 3-4-5 are **E S T**.

Therefore, we need two **new** letters in positions 1-2 that have **never appeared** in any previous guess and are **not** in the eliminated list.

The only remaining English 5-letter word that fits is:

“GUEST” – but U was in UPSET and marked (-) but that only means U is not in position 1, not necessarily eliminated. However, U was not ruled out completely, just not in position 1.

But checking Guess 4: UPSET → U(-) P(x) S(-) E(-) T(✓) – U was only marked (-) meaning U is in the word but not position 1.

Wait, this is key. I misread earlier.

Let me re-list **current exact state**:

- **Confirmed positions**:
  3: E
  4: S
  5: T

- **Eliminated letters** (never in the word):
  L, A, R, I, N, O, P, C, H

- **Letters that exist in the word but positions unknown**:
  S, T, E (but their positions are now locked as 3-4-5)

- **Letters with unknown presence**: all others except those listed as eliminated.

But we need positions 1 and 2.

Allowed letters for 1-2: any letters **except** the eliminated ones, and must form a valid 5-letter word with “E S T”.

Looking for real words ending in “EST” and checking their first two letters against the non-eliminated set:

- BEST – B, E (E used)
- WEST – W, E (E used)
- VEST – V, E (E used)
- JEST – J, E (E used)
- ZEST – Z, E (E used)
- GEST – G, E (E used)
- DREST – D, R (R eliminated)
- BLEST – B, L (L eliminated)
- FLEST – F, L (L eliminated)
- WREST – W, R (R eliminated)

None work.

But wait – “E S T” are already placed. The only possibility left is the word is actually **“BESET”** – but P is eliminated.

Rechecking – we need 5-letter word with:
- Positions 3-4-5 = E S T
- Positions 1-2 = any untested letters that make a word.

The only valid English word left is “PESTY” – but P is out.

I realize now – the **only valid English 5-letter word** that ends with “EST” and fits the remaining letters is **“GUEST”** – even though U was marked (-) in position 1 earlier, it is still allowed in position 2.

Let me check:
GUEST:
G – untested, allowed
U – allowed anywhere except position 1
E – position 3 (correct)
S – position 4 (correct)
T – position 5 (correct)

This word satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the final guess is:

Allowed first two letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Real words found:
- BEST  (4 letters only)
- VEST  (4 letters)
- ZEST  (4 letters)
- JEST  (4 letters)
- GEST  (4 letters)
- WEST  (4 letters)

None of these are 5 letters.

I realize I missed “BLEST” – but it has L which is out.

Next possible valid 5-letter word: “DREST” – but R is out.

“FLEST” – F and L – L out.

“GREST” – R out.

“KREST” – R out.

“MREST” – R out.

“YREST” – R out.

“BREST” – R out.

“WREST” – R out.

“QREST” – R out.

“ZREST” – R out.

“JREST” – R out.

“XREST” – R out.

There is **no common English 5-letter word** left that ends in “E S T” and only uses the remaining untested letters in positions 1-2.

I must have missed earlier. The only valid word left is “BESET” – but E is already used and P is out.

Rechecking feedback carefully:

From Guess 5: CHEST → C(x) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓)

So positions 3-4-5 are **E S T**.

Therefore, we need two **new** letters in positions 1-2 that have **never appeared** in any previous guess and are **not** in the eliminated list.

The only remaining English 5-letter word that fits is:

“GUEST” – but U was in UPSET and marked (-) but that only means U is not in position 1, not necessarily eliminated. However, U was not ruled out completely, just not in position 1.

But checking Guess 4: UPSET → U(-) P(x) S(-) E(-) T(✓) – U was only marked (-) meaning U is in the word but not position 1.

Wait, this is key. I misread earlier.

Let me re-list **current exact state**:

- **Confirmed positions**:
  3: E
  4: S
  5: T

- **Eliminated letters** (never in the word):
  L, A, R, I, N, O, P, C, H

- **Letters that exist in the word but positions unknown**:
  S, T, E (but their positions are now locked as 3-4-5)

- **Letters with unknown presence**: all others except those listed as eliminated.

But we need positions 1 and 2.

Allowed letters for 1-2: any letters **except** the eliminated ones, and must form a valid 5-letter word with “E S T”.

Looking for real words ending in “EST” and checking their first two letters against the non-eliminated set:

- BEST – B, E (E used)
- WEST – W, E (E used)
- VEST – V, E (E used)
- JEST – J, E (E used)
- ZEST – Z, E (E used)
- GEST – G, E (E used)
- DREST – D, R (R eliminated)
- BLEST – B, L (L eliminated)
- FLEST – F, L (L eliminated)
- WREST – W, R (R eliminated)

None work.

But wait – “E S T” are already placed. The only possibility left is the word is actually **“BESET”** – but P is eliminated.

Rechecking – we need 5-letter word with:
- Positions 3-4-5 = E S T
- Positions 1-2 = any untested letters that make a word.

The only valid English word left is “PESTY” – but P is out.

I realize now – the **only valid English 5-letter word** that ends with “EST” and fits the remaining letters is **“GUEST”** – even though U was marked (-) in position 1 earlier, it is still allowed in position 2.

Let me check:
GUEST:
G – untested, allowed
U – allowed anywhere except position 1
E – position 3 (correct)
S – position 4 (correct)
T – position 5 (correct)

This word satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the final guess is:

<guess>GUEST</guess>",Guess 6: GUEST -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) U(✓) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
