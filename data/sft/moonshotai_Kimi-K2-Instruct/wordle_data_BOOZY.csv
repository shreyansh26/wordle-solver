For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering various options, I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:

1. It contains all five major vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants (R, S)
2. These letters appear in many English words
3. It follows the valid 5-letter word constraint
4. It's a common word that should be in the dictionary

This should give me good coverage of possible letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses regardless of the feedback.

From the two previous guesses we know:

2. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

That leaves us with the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to pick a word that:
- Starts with one of the allowed consonants.
- Has O in position 2.
- Uses three more allowed letters in positions 3-5, while avoiding any of the forbidden letters.

Scanning my mental list of five-letter English words, “DOLLY” jumps out:  
- D is allowed.  
- O is already confirmed in position 2.  
- L, L, Y are all still allowed.

This keeps the pattern _ O _ _ _ and tests L and Y in positions 3-5 while avoiding every excluded letter.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. After considering various options, I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:

1. It contains all five major vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants (R, S)
2. These letters appear in many English words
3. It follows the valid 5-letter word constraint
4. It's a common word that should be in the dictionary

This should give me good coverage of possible letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position: _ O _ _ _

So the secret word is 5 letters, has O as the second letter, and does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Common letters left to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.  
I also want to avoid the excluded letters and place O in position 2.

A good next guess would be:
- Start with a consonant
- Place O in position 2
- Use other common consonants and vowels not yet excluded

Possible candidates: POINT, DOUGH, MOUNT, CLOUD, etc.

POINT: P, I, N, T - all valid letters not excluded yet

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _ (O is fixed in position 2).
2. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

That leaves us with the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to pick a word that:
- Starts with one of the allowed consonants.
- Has O in position 2.
- Uses three more allowed letters in positions 3-5, while avoiding any of the forbidden letters.

Scanning my mental list of five-letter English words, “DOLLY” jumps out:  
- D is allowed.  
- O is already confirmed in position 2.  
- L, L, Y are all still allowed.

This keeps the pattern _ O _ _ _ and tests L and Y in positions 3-5 while avoiding every excluded letter.

We now know:

- Pattern: B O _ _ Y  
- Positions 1, 2, 5 are locked: B O _ _ Y  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, D, L, G, U, K  

Remaining single-use letters that have not appeared yet and are still legal:
C, F, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z

We must fill positions 3 and 4 with any combination of these.

Quick scan of valid English words:

- BOFFY – uses F twice; but “boffy” is obscure.  
- BOCHY – not a common word.  
- BOMBY – an adjective meaning “bomby-looking”; acceptable.  
- BOVYY – invalid.  
- BOMBY is the only standard 5-letter English word fitting B O _ _ Y with allowable letters.

Therefore, BOMBY is the only remaining candidate that satisfies all constraints.
