For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet. This will give me the most information possible about which letters are in the secret word. Some common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. Contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
4. It's a valid English word

This should give me good feedback about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but in a different position.

- S(-)  → S is in the word but in a different position.

Let’s summarize the information we have so far.

Known facts about the secret word:
- 5 letters, ending in E.
- Contains the letters S, A, E.
- Letter positions:
  – S is in position 1 (✓).
  – E is **not** in position 4 (because in STEAL feedback E(-) means it is in the word but not in position 4). We already know E is in position 5 (from AROSE), so this is consistent.
  – A is somewhere but **not** position 1 (from AROSE) and **not** position 4 (from STEAL).
  – L is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already know is E, so this just confirms L is in positions 1-4).
  – T and R and O are **not** in the word.

So far:
_ S _ _ E  (with S fixed in position 1 and E fixed in position 5)
Letters to place: A, L
Possible positions for A: 2 or 3 (cannot be 1, 4)
Possible positions for L: 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5)

We have used letters: A, S, T, E, L, R, O
Letters not yet tested that are common: N, D, I, C, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

The word structure is: S _ _ _ E
We need two more letters in positions 2,3,4, with A and L occupying two of these three spots, and one new letter filling the remaining spot.

Possible patterns:
1. S A L _ E  → but then the last letter before E must be a new letter, but we already have A and L placed.
2. S A _ L E  → then the blank must be a new letter.
3. S _ A L E  → then the blank must be a new letter.
4. S L A _ E
5. S L _ A E
6. S _ L A E

We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns.

Let’s look at option 3: S _ A L E
We need a letter in position 2. Common letters that haven’t been tested: N, D, I, C, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Possible words:
- SNALE – not a word.
- SCALE – valid word.
- SMALE – not common.
- SHALE – valid word.
- STALE – but T is not in the word (from feedback).
- SPALE – not common.
- SCAGE – not a word.
- SHADE – but D would be in position 4, but position 4 is L here.
- SWALE – W not tested yet, but let’s see.

Between SCALE and SHALE:
- SCALE: S(1) C(2) A(3) L(4) E(5)
  – Fits all constraints: S in 1, E in 5, A not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3), L in 4 (ok), C is new.
- SHALE: S(1) H(2) A(3) L(4) E(5)
  – Also fits.

Both are valid, but SCALE uses C which is a very common letter. Let’s go with SCALE.

Wait: is SCALE valid? Yes, it’s a common word. Let me check:
S C A L E: positions and letters all fit the constraints.

So the next guess is SCALE.

- SMALE – not common.
- SHALE – valid word.
- STALE – but T is not in the word (from feedback).
- SPALE – not common.
- SCAGE – not a word.
- SHADE – but D would be in position 4, but position 4 is L here.
- SWALE – W not tested yet, but let’s see.

Between SCALE and SHALE:
- SCALE: S(1) C(2) A(3) L(4) E(5)
  – Fits all constraints: S in 1, E in 5, A not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3), L in 4 (ok), C is new.
- SHALE: S(1) H(2) A(3) L(4) E(5)
  – Also fits.

Both are valid, but SCALE uses C which is a very common letter. Let’s go with SCALE.

Wait: is SCALE valid? Yes, it’s a common word. Let me check:
S C A L E: positions and letters all fit the constraints.

So the next guess is SCALE.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Summary of constraints so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R and O are **not** in the word.

2. STEAL → S(✓) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(-)
   - S is in position 1.
   - T is **not** in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it is in 5, so this is redundant).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - L is in the word but not in position 5 (redundant since position 5 is E).

3. SCALE → S(✓) C(x) A(-) L(-) E(✓)
   - C is **not** in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S is in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

From these combined facts, we can build the word:

- Position 1: S
- Position 5: E
- Must contain A and L somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (only positions left).
- A cannot be in 1, 3, or 4 → the only spot left for A is position 2.
- L cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in position 3 or 4, but 4 is excluded (from SCALE), so L must be in position 3.
- That leaves position 4 to be filled by a new letter.

Current partial word: S A L _ E

We need one more letter for position 4 that hasn’t been ruled out.  
Letters already excluded: R, O, T, C  
Letters already used: S, A, L, E  
Common unused consonants: D, G, H, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.

Valid English 5-letter words that fit S A L _ E:
- SALVE
- SALLE (proper noun, not valid)
- SALME (archaic, not common)
- SALVE is the clear candidate.

Let’s check SALVE:
- S A L V E
- V is new and not excluded.
- All letters fit the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is SALVE.
