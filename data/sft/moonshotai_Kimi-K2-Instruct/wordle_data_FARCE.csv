- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I'm using a strategic opening word that maximizes information gain. The best starter words contain common letters across multiple positions and frequent letters in English words. 

My choice balances vowels and consonants, including:
- Common vowels (A, E, O)
- Frequent consonants (R, T)

This gives broad coverage to quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters early in the game.

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.

Next, I want to test new common letters while placing A and R in fresh positions. A strong candidate is “TREAD”:
- T is a very common consonant we haven’t tried.
- R is moved to position 2 (allowed, since earlier feedback only ruled out position 2 for R in the previous word, not globally).
- E is locked in position 5.
- A is now in position 3 (new spot for it).
- D is another common consonant not yet used.

Let’s interpret every piece of feedback carefully.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in the 1st position.
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word AND is in the 5th position.

From Guess 2 (TREAD):
- T is not in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (confirms Guess 1).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (but we already know it must be in the 5th position, so this is consistent).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.
- D is not in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Word form: _ _ _ _ E
- Must contain: A, R
- Must NOT contain: O, S, T, D
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- R cannot be in position 2

Remaining possible positions for A: 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is E, so 2 or 3)
Remaining possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (but 2 is excluded)

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2, R in position 1, and introduces new common letters.

Candidate: R A _ _ E

Filling blanks with common unused consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y (avoiding O, S, T, D).

Let’s try “RANGE”:
- R in 1st: allowed (no restriction yet).
- A in 2nd: allowed.
- N, G: not yet excluded.
- E in 5th: correct.

Check all constraints:
- Contains A, R, E (E in 5th) ✓
- No O, S, T, D ✓
- No letter violates positional bans so far.

We now have three rounds of feedback. Let’s consolidate all constraints.

Known facts:
- The word ends with E (position 5): _ _ _ _ E.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, T, D, N, G.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (now fixed at position 2), R, E (fixed at 5).
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (now irrelevant, since we’ve placed it at 2).
  – R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from RANGE feedback: R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1).
  – Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

Current pattern: _ A _ _ E, with R in 3 or 4, and no O/S/T/D/N/G.

Possible remaining letters (high-frequency, unused): B, C, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Case 1: R in position 3 → pattern _ A R _ E
We need a consonant for position 1 and one for position 4.
No restrictions on position 1 yet except avoiding forbidden letters.
Good candidates for position 1: B, C, F, H, L, M, P, W, etc.
Good candidates for position 4: same set, but must also avoid repeating any letter already used (none have been used twice).

From the remaining consonants, let’s pick a pair that helps prune possibilities:
Try “FARCE”:
- F (pos 1) and C (pos 4) are both still legal.
- Word is valid 5-letter English word.
- Uses exactly the required letters A, R, E with A at 2, E at 5, R at 3.
- No forbidden letters.
