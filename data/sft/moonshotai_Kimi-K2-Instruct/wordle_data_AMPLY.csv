For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes common vowels and consonants, without repeating any letters. This way, I can test as many different letters as possible. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"".

Looking at these options, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
- It has the vowels A, I, and E (three of the five vowels)
- It has common consonants R and S
- No letters are repeated
- All letters are very common in 5-letter English words

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possible letters in the word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

Key take-aways:
1. A exists in the secret word, but not in position 2.
2. Eliminated letters: R, I, S, E.

Next step: pick a word that
- contains A in a different position (not 2),
- avoids R, I, S, E,
- introduces new, common letters we haven't tested yet.

Good remaining consonants to test: C, D, N, T, L, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).

A word like “ACORN” would reuse some vowels/consonants we’ve already eliminated (R is out).  
“PLANT” has A in position 3 (different from 2) and introduces P, L, N, T.  
“MOUND” is another option, but A is missing.  
I’ll go with “PLANT” because it has A in position 3, tests P, L, N, T, and avoids every eliminated letter.

L must go in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2).  
A must go in positions 1,4,5 (not 2,3).

Try “PALLY” – invalid (double L).  
“PALMY” – valid word, uses A(2) – but A can’t be in 2.  
“AMPUL” – not common.  
“APPLY” – has P twice.  

Better: “CULPA” – reverse order, but not helpful.

“OPALY” – not a word.

“C P D L A” – need valid word.  
“CYPLA” – invalid.  
“MOPAL” – has “A” in 3 – invalid.  

Re-evaluate: we need a word containing A, P, L with positions:  
A not 2 or 3, P not 1, L not 2, and no R,I,S,E,N,T.

A valid word: “PALMY” – but A is in 2 (invalid).

A is 5 (allowed), P is 2 (allowed), L is 4 (allowed), M is 1, U is 3.  
Letters: M, A, P, U, L – all allowed.

- A is in 5 (new position).  
- P is in 2 (new position).  
- L is in 4 (new position).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

Key take-aways:
1. A exists in the secret word, but not in position 2.
2. Eliminated letters: R, I, S, E.

Next step: pick a word that
- contains A in a different position (not 2),
- avoids R, I, S, E,
- introduces new, common letters we haven't tested yet.

Good remaining consonants to test: C, D, N, T, L, M, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).

A word like “ACORN” would reuse some vowels/consonants we’ve already eliminated (R is out).  
“PLANT” has A in position 3 (different from 2) and introduces P, L, N, T.  
“MOUND” is another option, but A is missing.  
I’ll go with “PLANT” because it has A in position 3, tests P, L, N, T, and avoids every eliminated letter.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A exists, but not in position 2.
   - Eliminated: R, I, S, E.

2. PLANT → P(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, A are all in the word but in wrong positions.
   - N and T are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Must contain the letters A, P, L.
- Cannot have A in positions 2 or 3, P in position 1, or L in position 2.
- Cannot have R, I, S, E, N, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, Y.

We need to arrange A, P, L plus two new letters (from remaining set) into a 5-letter word satisfying the position constraints.

Let’s try to put A in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).

Option 1: A _ _ L _  
Valid letters left: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, Y.

“ALCOH” – not a word.  
“ALBUM” – contains M (valid), U (valid).  
Let’s check: A(1), L(4), P must go somewhere.  
“ALBUP” – invalid.  

Another approach: P must go in positions 2,3,4,5 (not 1).  
L must go in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2).  
A must go in positions 1,4,5 (not 2,3).

Try “PALLY” – invalid (double L).  
“PALMY” – valid word, uses A(2) – but A can’t be in 2.  
“AMPUL” – not common.  
“APPLY” – has P twice.  

Better: “CULPA” – reverse order, but not helpful.  

Let’s try “P” in position 2, “L” in position 3, “A” in 4 or 5:  
_ P L A _  
Need two new letters.  
“OPALY” – not a word.  
“HPLAG” – invalid.  

Try “LAP” as root:  
“LAP” + “H” + “O” = “LAPHO” – invalid.  

Try “PAL” as root:  
“PAL” + “M” + “O” = “PALMO” – not a word.  

Alternative: “P” in 3, “L” in 4, “A” in 5:  
_ _ P L A  
Need two letters.  
“COPLA” – not English.  
“GULPA” – not a word.  

Try “L” in 1, “P” in 3, “A” in 4 or 5:  
L _ P A _  
“LOPAY” – not a word.  
“LUPAS” – has S (eliminated).  

Try “P” in 4, “L” in 5, “A” in 1:  
A _ _ P L  
“ACRPL” – invalid.  

Try “A” in 5:  
_ _ _ _ A  
But need P and L somewhere.  

Let’s try “P” in 2, “L” in 4, “A” in 5:  
_ P _ L A  
“C P D L A” – need valid word.  
“CYPLA” – invalid.  
“MOPAL” – has “A” in 3 – invalid.  

Re-evaluate: we need a word containing A, P, L with positions:  
A not 2 or 3, P not 1, L not 2, and no R,I,S,E,N,T.

A valid word: “PALMY” – but A is in 2 (invalid).  
“AMPUL” – M, P, U, L, A. Check positions:  
A is 5 (allowed), P is 2 (allowed), L is 4 (allowed), M is 1, U is 3.  
Letters: M, A, P, U, L – all allowed.  
Word: “AMPUL” – yes, a valid English word meaning a sealed glass capsule.

Constraints:
- A is in 5 (new position).  
- P is in 2 (new position).  
- L is in 4 (new position).  
- Introduces M and U (not tested yet).  
- No eliminated letters.

Thus, “AMPUL” is a strong next guess.

Now we know:
