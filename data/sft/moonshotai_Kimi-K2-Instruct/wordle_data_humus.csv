For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best opening words typically contain common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C, D

A good strategy is to include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This seems like an excellent choice for maximizing information gain on the first try.

- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

- Uses U (not in 3rd)  
- Uses only the remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N)

A good candidate is LUSKS (but LUSKS is not a common English word).  
SWISH uses S twice, which is okay if it’s a valid word.  
SULKS is valid but uses K and L, both untested, and places U in position 2 (allowed) and S in 1st (forbidden).  
Let’s try a word like PLUSH.  
PLUSH: P, L, U, S, H.  
- U is in position 3 → but we know U can’t be in position 3. So PLUSH is invalid.

- U in 2nd position → allowed (not 3rd)

- S in 1st position (we know S isn’t in 4th, so 1st is okay).
- T and N are common and untested.
- U is an untested vowel.
- Avoids A,R,O,E.

This seems better since it includes the confirmed S and tests new letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STUNT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   - Tells us S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STUNT → S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
   - Confirms S is still in the word, but NOT in position 1.
   - Eliminates T and N.
   - Tells us U is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N  
Letters known to be present: S (position ≠ 1, 4), U (position ≠ 3)

Remaining vowels to test: I, Y  
Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S (already known), V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (not in 1st or 4th)  
- Uses U (not in 3rd)  
- Uses only the remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N)

A good candidate is LUSKS (but LUSKS is not a common English word).  
SWISH uses S twice, which is okay if it’s a valid word.  
SULKS is valid but uses K and L, both untested, and places U in position 2 (allowed) and S in 1st (forbidden).  
Let’s try a word like PLUSH.  
PLUSH: P, L, U, S, H.  
- U is in position 3 → but we know U can’t be in position 3. So PLUSH is invalid.

How about PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y.  
- S in 3rd position → allowed (not 1st or 4th)  
- U in 2nd position → allowed (not 3rd)  
- All letters are untested and not eliminated.  
- PUSHY is a valid 5-letter English word.

This seems like a strong next guess.

The best opening words typically contain common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C, D

A good strategy is to include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This seems like an excellent choice for maximizing information gain on the first try.

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an S somewhere except the 4th spot.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We also still need to test common consonants and vowels that we haven’t tried yet. Letters we haven’t used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Uses S (not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H
Good remaining vowels: I, U

Let’s pick “UNTIL”:
- U is an untested vowel.
- N and T are common consonants we haven’t tried.
- I is an untested vowel.
- L is a common consonant.
- S is not in UNTIL, but we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Actually, let’s pick a word that includes the S we know is present. How about “STUNT”:
- S in 1st position (we know S isn’t in 4th, so 1st is okay).
- T and N are common and untested.
- U is an untested vowel.

Latest feedback:  
SULKS → S(-) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(✓)

This tells us:
1. First-letter S is NOT correct (S(-)).
2. U is correct in position 2 (U(✓)).
3. L is NOT in the word (L(x)).
4. K is NOT in the word (K(x)).
5. The last letter S is correct (S(✓)).

So the word must be: _ U _ _ S  
with constraints:
- S already fixed in position 5.
- U already fixed in position 2.
- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, P, Y, L, K.

Remaining letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We still need to decide positions 1 and 3-4, but from previous feedback:
- S is allowed only in positions 1 or 5; since position 5 is now correct, no other S is allowed.
- H is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from PUSHY feedback).

Therefore, H must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for common English words fitting the pattern: ? U ? ? S with H somewhere, and using only the allowed letters.

Common candidates:
- BUHRS – R is eliminated → invalid  
- CUBES – B is allowed, E is eliminated → invalid  
- DUKES – K, E eliminated → invalid  
- FUGUS – F, G, U, S; but U is only once and already fixed in position 2 → invalid  
- GUMPS – M, P allowed; P is eliminated → invalid  
- HUMUS – H, U, M, U, S; U appears twice which is possible, but we need to check constraints:  
  - H is allowed in position 1.  
  - M is allowed.  
  - U is already in position 2 and appears again in positions 3 and 4.  
  - However, PUSHY showed U is only in position 2, so U cannot appear again elsewhere. HUMUS is invalid.  
- MUCUS – U appears twice → invalid.  
- DUCHS – C, H, S; but D is allowed, C is allowed, H is allowed. ""DUCHS"" is not a common English word.  
- HOCUS – H, O, C, U, S; O is eliminated → invalid.  
- FUCHS – F, U, C, H, S  
  - F allowed  
  - U in position 2 (correct)  
  - C allowed  
  - H allowed in position 4 → but PUSHY feedback said H is NOT in position 4. So H must be in 1 or 3.  
  - In FUCHS, H is in position 4, which is forbidden → invalid.  

Next approach: H must be in position 1 or 3.

Case 1: H in position 1 → H U _ _ S  
   Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, I, M, V, W, etc.  
   Common words:  
   - HUCKS – K eliminated → invalid  
   - HUMPS – M is allowed, P is eliminated → invalid  
   - HUMUS – U appears twice → invalid  
   - HUDDS – D allowed, but double D uncommon → not ideal  
   - HUFFS – F allowed  
     H U F F S – F appears twice; possible.  

But are there better single-letter options? Let’s avoid double letters if possible.

Case 2: H in position 3 → _ U H _ S  
   First letter must be from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, I, M, V, W, etc.  
   Common word: BUHRS – R eliminated → invalid  
   FUHAS – not a word  
   DUHKS – not a word  
   CU...HS – not obvious  

Looking back at position 1 and 3:  
We need two distinct letters from remaining set for positions 1 and 3 (or 1 and 4 if H is in 3).

A more systematic scan for valid English words matching _ U _ _ S, letters from allowed set, with H in 1 or 3:

- H U M I S – ""HUMIS"" not valid  
- H U G E S – E eliminated  
- H U D D S – valid but double D  
- H U B B S – B allowed, double B  
- H U M P S – P eliminated  
- H U G S S – invalid  
- C U B H S – not a word  

Surprisingly, the common dictionary is sparse here. The most plausible valid word that fits all constraints is HUFFS (H U F F S), even though it has double F. It satisfies:
- H in position 1 (allowed, since H not excluded from position 1)  
- U in position 2 (correct)  
- F allowed, F allowed  
- S in position 5 (correct)  
- No eliminated letters  

Next best might be MUFFS: M U F F S. But we haven’t placed H yet, and we know H must be in the word. So MUFFS is invalid because it omits H.

Wait, we deduced from PUSHY feedback that H must be in the word (H(-) indicated it's in the word but not in 4th position). Therefore any valid candidate must include H.

Hence, the only reasonable valid word remaining is HUFFS, despite the double F.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best opening words typically contain common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C, D

A good strategy is to include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - which includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This seems like an excellent choice for maximizing information gain on the first try.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an S somewhere except the 4th spot.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We also still need to test common consonants and vowels that we haven’t tried yet. Letters we haven’t used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Uses S (not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H
Good remaining vowels: I, U

Let’s pick “UNTIL”:
- U is an untested vowel.
- N and T are common consonants we haven’t tried.
- I is an untested vowel.
- L is a common consonant.
- S is not in UNTIL, but we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Actually, let’s pick a word that includes the S we know is present. How about “STUNT”:
- S in 1st position (we know S isn’t in 4th, so 1st is okay).
- T and N are common and untested.
- U is an untested vowel.
- Avoids A,R,O,E.

This seems better since it includes the confirmed S and tests new letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   - Tells us S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STUNT → S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
   - Confirms S is still in the word, but NOT in position 1.
   - Eliminates T and N.
   - Tells us U is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N  
Letters known to be present: S (position ≠ 1, 4), U (position ≠ 3)

Remaining vowels to test: I, Y  
Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S (already known), V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (not in 1st or 4th)  
- Uses U (not in 3rd)  
- Uses only the remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N)

A good candidate is LUSKS (but LUSKS is not a common English word).  
SWISH uses S twice, which is okay if it’s a valid word.  
SULKS is valid but uses K and L, both untested, and places U in position 2 (allowed) and S in 1st (forbidden).  
Let’s try a word like PLUSH.  
PLUSH: P, L, U, S, H.  
- U is in position 3 → but we know U can’t be in position 3. So PLUSH is invalid.

How about PUSHY: P, U, S, H, Y.  
- S in 3rd position → allowed (not 1st or 4th)  
- U in 2nd position → allowed (not 3rd)  
- All letters are untested and not eliminated.  
- PUSHY is a valid 5-letter English word.

This seems like a strong next guess.

- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position  
- H(-) – H is in the word but NOT in the 4th position  
- Y(x) – Y is NOT in the word

We now know:

Letters that are OUT: A, R, O, E, T, N, P, Y  
Letters that are IN and their constraints:  
   U at position 2  
   S must appear somewhere except positions 1, 3, 4  
   H must appear somewhere except position 4  

Remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  

Word structure so far: _ U _ _ _

Possible positions for S: 2 is taken by U, 3 and 4 are forbidden, so S can only be at 1 or 5.

Possible positions for H: 2 is taken by U, 4 is forbidden, so H can be at 1, 3, or 5.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with remaining letters, ensuring:
- S appears exactly once (positions 1 or 5)  
- H appears exactly once (positions 1, 3, or 5, and must not conflict with S)  
- Each of the remaining blanks uses a letter from the allowed list.

Let’s investigate both placements of S:

Case 1: S in position 1 (S U _ _ _)
   - H must go in 3 or 5.  
   - Position 3: try C, D, F, G, etc.  
   - Position 5: try L, K, M, etc.

Looking for common words:
   S U _ _ _

Some valid English words starting with SU:
   - SUITS – but T is eliminated  
   - SULKS – T is eliminated, K is allowed, L is allowed  
   - SULKS: S U L K S – but S appears twice, and we don’t know yet if S is allowed twice. The puzzle does not forbid duplicate letters unless the feedback explicitly shows it. Let’s check constraints: S can be in 1 and 5, U is at 2, L and K are allowed. SULKS is a valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5 (_ U _ _ S)
   - H must go in 1 or 3.  
   - Let’s try H in 1: H U _ _ S  
      Candidate: HUMPS – M is allowed, P is eliminated → invalid  
      HUCKS – C, K are allowed  
   - Try H in 3: _ U H _ S  
      Candidate: BUHRS – but B, U, H, R, S; R is eliminated → invalid  
      DUHKS – not a common English word  

Between these, SULKS fits all constraints and is a known word.

Guess 2: STUNT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: PUSHY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
Guess 4: SULKS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback:  
SULKS → S(-) U(✓) L(x) K(x) S(✓)

This tells us:
1. First-letter S is NOT correct (S(-)).
2. U is correct in position 2 (U(✓)).
3. L is NOT in the word (L(x)).
4. K is NOT in the word (K(x)).
5. The last letter S is correct (S(✓)).

So the word must be: _ U _ _ S  
with constraints:
- S already fixed in position 5.
- U already fixed in position 2.
- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, P, Y, L, K.

Remaining letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We still need to decide positions 1 and 3-4, but from previous feedback:
- S is allowed only in positions 1 or 5; since position 5 is now correct, no other S is allowed.
- H is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from PUSHY feedback).

Therefore, H must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for common English words fitting the pattern: ? U ? ? S with H somewhere, and using only the allowed letters.

Common candidates:
- BUHRS – R is eliminated → invalid  
- CUBES – B is allowed, E is eliminated → invalid  
- DUKES – K, E eliminated → invalid  
- FUGUS – F, G, U, S; but U is only once and already fixed in position 2 → invalid  
- GUMPS – M, P allowed; P is eliminated → invalid  
- HUMUS – H, U, M, U, S; U appears twice which is possible, but we need to check constraints:  
  - H is allowed in position 1.  
  - M is allowed.  
  - U is already in position 2 and appears again in positions 3 and 4.  
  - However, PUSHY showed U is only in position 2, so U cannot appear again elsewhere. HUMUS is invalid.  
- MUCUS – U appears twice → invalid.  
- DUCHS – C, H, S; but D is allowed, C is allowed, H is allowed. ""DUCHS"" is not a common English word.  
- HOCUS – H, O, C, U, S; O is eliminated → invalid.  
- FUCHS – F, U, C, H, S  
  - F allowed  
  - U in position 2 (correct)  
  - C allowed  
  - H allowed in position 4 → but PUSHY feedback said H is NOT in position 4. So H must be in 1 or 3.  
  - In FUCHS, H is in position 4, which is forbidden → invalid.  

Next approach: H must be in position 1 or 3.

Case 1: H in position 1 → H U _ _ S  
   Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, I, M, V, W, etc.  
   Common words:  
   - HUCKS – K eliminated → invalid  
   - HUMPS – M is allowed, P is eliminated → invalid  
   - HUMUS – U appears twice → invalid  
   - HUDDS – D allowed, but double D uncommon → not ideal  
   - HUFFS – F allowed  
     H U F F S – F appears twice; possible.  

But are there better single-letter options? Let’s avoid double letters if possible.

Case 2: H in position 3 → _ U H _ S  
   First letter must be from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, I, M, V, W, etc.  
   Common word: BUHRS – R eliminated → invalid  
   FUHAS – not a word  
   DUHKS – not a word  
   CU...HS – not obvious  

Looking back at position 1 and 3:  
We need two distinct letters from remaining set for positions 1 and 3 (or 1 and 4 if H is in 3).

A more systematic scan for valid English words matching _ U _ _ S, letters from allowed set, with H in 1 or 3:

- H U M I S – ""HUMIS"" not valid  
- H U G E S – E eliminated  
- H U D D S – valid but double D  
- H U B B S – B allowed, double B  
- H U M P S – P eliminated  
- H U G S S – invalid  
- C U B H S – not a word  

Surprisingly, the common dictionary is sparse here. The most plausible valid word that fits all constraints is HUFFS (H U F F S), even though it has double F. It satisfies:
- H in position 1 (allowed, since H not excluded from position 1)  
- U in position 2 (correct)  
- F allowed, F allowed  
- S in position 5 (correct)  
- No eliminated letters  

Next best might be MUFFS: M U F F S. But we haven’t placed H yet, and we know H must be in the word. So MUFFS is invalid because it omits H.

Wait, we deduced from PUSHY feedback that H must be in the word (H(-) indicated it's in the word but not in 4th position). Therefore any valid candidate must include H.

Hence, the only reasonable valid word remaining is HUFFS, despite the double F.

H U F F S – already guessed.

Another candidate: H U D G E – E eliminated.

Actually, a better word is H U G E S – but E is eliminated.
