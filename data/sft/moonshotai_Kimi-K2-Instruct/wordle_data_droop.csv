For my first guess, I want to maximize the information gained by choosing a word with common English letters. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good strategy is to use a word that contains as many of these letters as possible. The word ""CRANE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E), making it an excellent first guess to eliminate or confirm many positions and letters quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:

C (first letter) – not in the word at all  
R (second letter) – correct letter and correct position  
A – not in the word  
N – not in the word  
E – not in the word  

So we now know:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- The word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

We still need to find four more letters for positions 1, 3, 4, and 5.  Since we’ve eliminated C, A, N, and E, the remaining high-frequency letters are T, O, I, S, H, L, U, D, M, etc.  A good next guess uses new high-frequency letters while keeping the confirmed R in place.

A strong candidate is “TRIMS”:  
- Keeps R in position 2.  
- Introduces T, I, M, S – all common letters we haven’t tested yet.  
- Forms a valid 5-letter word.

Current knowledge:
- Position 2 is definitely R.
- Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, T, I, M, S.
That leaves many other common letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We still need to determine:
- Position 1: any of the remaining letters.
- Position 3: any of the remaining letters.
- Position 4: any of the remaining letters.
- Position 5: any of the remaining letters.

A good next step is to choose a word that uses a new set of high-frequency letters not yet tested and keeps R in the second position. Among the remaining letters, B, D, L, O, U are quite common. A simple, common word that uses several of these letters while placing R second is BROAD (B, R, O, A, D). However, A has already been ruled out. Another option is ""BROOD"" – but the double O might be less optimal. Looking for another common word with R fixed in second place and using fresh letters, ""DROOL"" comes to mind, but O is used twice. 

Another candidate with distinct remaining high-frequency letters is ""PROUD"":
- P is a common untested letter.
- R is correctly placed.
- O, U, D are also common and untested so far.

""PROUD"" fits all constraints:
- Position 2 is R.
- Uses new letters P, O, U, D (none of which have been ruled out yet).

From the combined feedback so far:

Positions: 1 2(R) 3 4 5  
- Position 2 is locked as R.

Letters already ruled-out entirely:  
C, A, N, E, T, I, M, S, U (from PROUD)

Letters with status from PROUD:  
- P: in the word but not at position 1  
- O: correct at position 3  
- U: not in the word  
- D: in the word but not at position 5  

So now we have:  
- Pattern: _ R O _ _  
- The word contains P and D (somewhere other than positions 1 and 5 respectively)  
- No C, A, N, E, T, I, M, S, U

Candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and of course P (already known to be present) and D.

We need to fit P and D into the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, 5) such that:
- P is not at position 1 (already)  
- D is not at position 5  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit the skeleton “_ R O _ _” and require both P and D yields:

B R O K E – invalid (contains E)  
F R O G S – invalid (contains S)  
…

Eventually we land on **G R O U P** – but U is invalid.  
Next viable option: **B R O W D** – invalid (D at 5).  
Next: **D R O W P** – invalid (D at 1).  
Next: **F R O W D** – same issue with D at 5.  

More promising: **G R O W D** – still D at 5.  
Let’s try placing D in position 4 and P in position 5: **B R O D P** – not a real word.

Instead, place P in position 1 and D in position 4: **P R O D _** – needs a final letter.  
Valid word: **P R O D Y** (a real 5-letter word).  
- P is at 1 but PROUD told us P is in the word but NOT at 1 – so this is invalid.

Try P at position 4 and D at position 1: **D R O _ P** – needs middle letter 4.  
Real word: **D R O O P** – but double O is okay.  
Check constraints:  
- P at 5 (allowed; PROUD said P not at 1, no restriction on 5)  
- D at 1 (allowed; PROUD said D not at 5, no restriction on 1)  
- Letters used: D, R, O, O, P – no disallowed letters.  

**DROOP** satisfies every rule we have so far.

Therefore, the next guess is DROOP.
