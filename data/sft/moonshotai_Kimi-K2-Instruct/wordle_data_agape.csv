For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering frequently used letters in English. A common strategy is to choose a word with high utility letters (vowels and common consonants) in positions that can help narrow down possibilities.

Good first guesses often include:
- At least 2-3 vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
- Avoid rarely used letters like Q, X, Z for first guess

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All top 5 most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, S)
- Good mix of vowels and consonants
- No repeated letters, maximizing information

Another strong choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After consideration, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits all major common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern is:

Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already placed)

- ALIKE
- ABIDE
- ANGLE
- AMPLE
- AXILE (but X is rare)
- AGILE
- ALONE (but O is excluded)
- AMINE

Among these, ""ALIKE"" seems good:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A common strategy is to choose a word with high utility letters (vowels and common consonants) in positions that can help narrow down possibilities.

Good first guesses often include:
- At least 2-3 vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
- Avoid rarely used letters like Q, X, Z for first guess

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All top 5 most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, S)
- Good mix of vowels and consonants
- No repeated letters, maximizing information

Another strong choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After consideration, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits all major common letters efficiently.

- E(✓) – correct letter in correct spot (position 5)
- R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Ends with E
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S anywhere
- Uses only valid English letters

Good consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are already placed)

Let’s list some candidates that fit A _ _ _ E and avoid R, O, S:
- ALIKE
- ABIDE
- ANGLE
- AMPLE
- AXILE (but X is rare)
- AGILE
- ALONE (but O is excluded)
- AMINE

Among these, ""ALIKE"" seems good:
- Uses common letters (L, I, K)
- No R, O, S
- Starts with A and ends with E

Another option is ""ABIDE"" but D is slightly less common than L/I/K.
""ALIKE"" gives us new letters (L, I, K) to test.

I'll go with ALIKE.

- APACE – uses P, C; no forbidden letters

Best choices from the above:

2. ACUTE – uses C, U, T
3. APACE – uses P, C

- Second letter ∈ {C, F, H, M, N, P, W, Y, U}
- Fourth letter ∈ {C, F, H, M, N, P, W, Y, U} \ {G}
- And the letter G must appear in either position 2 or 5 (but position 5 is fixed as E, so it must be position 2).

Therefore the second letter must be G.

Try “AGAVE”:
- A(✓) G(-) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)

But V hasn’t been tested yet and isn’t forbidden, so it’s a valid test.

However, we know G is in the word but not in position 4, so let’s place G in position 2.

Check any dictionary: the only common 5-letter word that fits A G A _ E is “AGAPE” (second letter G, fourth letter P).

Let’s verify:
- A G A P E
- Letters used: A (positions 1,3), G (position 2), P (position 4), E (position 5)
- G is allowed to be in position 2, since it’s marked “-” only for position 4.
- P hasn’t been ruled out yet.

So “AGAPE” is the logical next guess.

<guess>AGAPE</guess>",AGAPE,"From the latest feedback on ADAGE:
- Position 1: A(✓) – locked in.
- Position 2: D(x) – D is not in the word at all.
- Position 3: A(✓) – locked in.
- Position 4: G(-) – G is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Position 5: E(✓) – locked in.

So the pattern is now:
A _ A _ E  
with the constraints:
- Second letter: cannot be R, O, S, L, I, K, B, T, D
- Fourth letter: cannot be G (and must be a letter that appears somewhere else in the word, since G is marked “-”)
- Forbidden letters entirely: R, O, S, L, I, K, B, T, D
- Allowed letters for the blanks: C, F, H, M, N, P, W, Y, plus U (only in positions 2 or 4)

Looking for a word that fits A _ A _ E with:
- Second letter ∈ {C, F, H, M, N, P, W, Y, U}
- Fourth letter ∈ {C, F, H, M, N, P, W, Y, U} \ {G}
- And the letter G must appear in either position 2 or 5 (but position 5 is fixed as E, so it must be position 2).

Therefore the second letter must be G.
