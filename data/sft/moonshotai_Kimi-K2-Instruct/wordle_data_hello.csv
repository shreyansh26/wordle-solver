For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word with common letters that can give us a lot of information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word, while also covering different positions. A good first guess often includes vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: A, E, S, T, R, I, N, O, L, D, etc. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, E (common consonants)
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us a good chance to identify at least some letters that are in the secret word, regardless of what it is.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - S, L, A, T, E are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong starting guess.

- O(-) – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A is out, O and E are in).

A balanced choice could be ""OCEAN"", but it uses A (already ruled out).  
""OLIVE"" uses V, which is less common.  
Looking for a word like ""T O N E _"" or ""M O N E _"".

""TONED"" uses T, O, N, E, D – all fairly common, avoids A, R, S, and tests new letters.

So far we are certain:
- The word contains O and E, but:
  – O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (NOT 2, 3 already disallowed).
  – E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (NOT 4, 5 already disallowed).

2. Introduces common unused consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).

Available common consonants: L, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.
Available vowels: I, U, Y.

A classic pattern is _O_E_ or O_ _E_, but let’s pick something that covers new letters efficiently.  
“COMET” would use C, M, T – T is out.  
“PROBE” uses P, R, B – R is out.  
“HOBBY” uses H, B, B, Y – B and Y are new, but double B is wasteful.  
“VOICE” uses V, I, C – all new.  Positions: O in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).  Double-check: V, I, C haven’t been tested yet, and O and E are still in possible spots.  This seems like a good high-value guess.

So the next guess is VOICE.

“HOBBY” uses H, B, B, Y – B and Y are new, but double B is wasteful.  
“VOICE” uses V, I, C – all new.  Positions: O in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).  Double-check: V, I, C haven’t been tested yet, and O and E are still in possible spots.  This seems like a good high-value guess.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

Known absent letters (x): A, R, S, T, N, D, V, I, C  
Known present letters (-):  
- O (not in position 3 or 2)  
- E (not in position 4 or 5)  

So O must be in position 1 or 4 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out)  
E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (positions 4 and 5 ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and E in their allowed positions  
- Introduces only letters *not* on the banned list (i.e., from remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z)  
- Must be a valid English word.

Candidate pattern:  
If O is in position 1, possible words like OBEYS, OXFLY, etc.  
If O is in position 4, possible words like FLOPE, GLOBE, etc.

Let's look at O in position 1 and E in position 2: O E _ _ _  
Valid word: OBEYS (B, Y, S – but S is banned). So skip.  
Valid word: OBEAH (H is allowed). 5-letter word, yes. But obscure.

Possible word: BELOW – B, E, L, O, W.  
Check letters: B, E, L, O, W – none banned.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word with common letters that can give us a lot of information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word, while also covering different positions. A good first guess often includes vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: A, E, S, T, R, I, N, O, L, D, etc. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, E (common consonants)
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us a good chance to identify at least some letters that are in the secret word, regardless of what it is.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - S, L, A, T, E are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong starting guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is **not** in the word.
- R(x) – R is **not** in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So we know:
Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters in the word: O (not 3rd), E (not 5th)

Next, we want a word that:
- Uses O and E in new positions (O can go 1,2,4,5; E can go 1,2,3,4)
- Avoids A, R, S
- Includes other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A is out, O and E are in).

A balanced choice could be ""OCEAN"", but it uses A (already ruled out).  
""OLIVE"" uses V, which is less common.  
Looking for a word like ""T O N E _"" or ""M O N E _"".

""TONED"" uses T, O, N, E, D – all fairly common, avoids A, R, S, and tests new letters.  
Positions: O is now 2nd (allowed), E is 4th (allowed).

Let's go with TONED.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback recap:
- T(x), N(x), D(x) – these letters are NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S (from AROSE) + T, N, D (from TONED) = 6 letters gone.

So far we are certain:
- The word contains O and E, but:
  – O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (NOT 2, 3 already disallowed).
  – E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (NOT 4, 5 already disallowed).

We need a fresh word that:
1. Uses O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces common unused consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).

Available common consonants: L, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.
Available vowels: I, U, Y.

A classic pattern is _O_E_ or O_ _E_, but let’s pick something that covers new letters efficiently.  
“COMET” would use C, M, T – T is out.  
“PROBE” uses P, R, B – R is out.  
“HOBBY” uses H, B, B, Y – B and Y are new, but double B is wasteful.  
“VOICE” uses V, I, C – all new.  Positions: O in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).  Double-check: V, I, C haven’t been tested yet, and O and E are still in possible spots.  This seems like a good high-value guess.

So the next guess is VOICE.

Summary of what we now know:

Absent letters (x): A, R, S, T, N, D, V, I, C, B, W  
Present letters with positions locked in:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (✓)

Present letters still floating:
- O (not in position 4, not in 2 or 3 either) – so O must be in 1 or 5  
  (positions 2 and 3 are taken by E and L)

So the word so far looks like:
_ E L _ _
or
_ _ _ E L   (but E must be 2nd, so second pattern impossible)

Hence the skeleton is: _ E L _ _

With O in slot 1 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- O E L _ _  → but no vowel left in slot 4 (only U left) and consonants left: F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, Z  
- _ E L _ O  → slot 1 and 4 must be filled with remaining allowed letters.

Let’s explore the second pattern: _ E L _ O  
Possible consonants for slot 1 and 4: from F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, Z  
A valid word must be formed.

Present letters with positions locked in:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (✓)

Present letters still floating:
- O (not in position 4, not in 2 or 3 either) – so O must be in 1 or 5  
  (positions 2 and 3 are taken by E and L)

So the word so far looks like:

_ _ _ E L   (but E must be 2nd, so second pattern impossible)

Hence the skeleton is: _ E L _ _

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word with common letters that can give us a lot of information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word, while also covering different positions. A good first guess often includes vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: A, E, S, T, R, I, N, O, L, D, etc. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, E (common consonants)
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us a good chance to identify at least some letters that are in the secret word, regardless of what it is.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - S, L, A, T, E are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong starting guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is **not** in the word.
- R(x) – R is **not** in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So we know:
Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S
Letters in the word: O (not 3rd), E (not 5th)

Next, we want a word that:
- Uses O and E in new positions (O can go 1,2,4,5; E can go 1,2,3,4)
- Avoids A, R, S
- Includes other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A is out, O and E are in).

A balanced choice could be ""OCEAN"", but it uses A (already ruled out).  
""OLIVE"" uses V, which is less common.  
Looking for a word like ""T O N E _"" or ""M O N E _"".

""TONED"" uses T, O, N, E, D – all fairly common, avoids A, R, S, and tests new letters.  
Positions: O is now 2nd (allowed), E is 4th (allowed).

Let's go with TONED.

<guess>TONED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback recap:
- T(x), N(x), D(x) – these letters are NOT in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S (from AROSE) + T, N, D (from TONED) = 6 letters gone.

So far we are certain:
- The word contains O and E, but:
  – O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (NOT 2, 3 already disallowed).
  – E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (NOT 4, 5 already disallowed).

We need a fresh word that:
1. Uses O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces common unused consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).

Available common consonants: L, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.
Available vowels: I, U, Y.

A classic pattern is _O_E_ or O_ _E_, but let’s pick something that covers new letters efficiently.  
“COMET” would use C, M, T – T is out.  
“PROBE” uses P, R, B – R is out.  
“HOBBY” uses H, B, B, Y – B and Y are new, but double B is wasteful.  
“VOICE” uses V, I, C – all new.  Positions: O in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).  Double-check: V, I, C haven’t been tested yet, and O and E are still in possible spots.  This seems like a good high-value guess.

So the next guess is VOICE.

Guess 3: VOICE -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize everything we now know:

Known absent letters (x): A, R, S, T, N, D, V, I, C  
Known present letters (-):  
- O (not in position 3 or 2)  
- E (not in position 4 or 5)  

So O must be in position 1 or 4 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out)  
E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (positions 4 and 5 ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and E in their allowed positions  
- Introduces only letters *not* on the banned list (i.e., from remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z)  
- Must be a valid English word.

Candidate pattern:  
If O is in position 1, possible words like OBEYS, OXFLY, etc.  
If O is in position 4, possible words like FLOPE, GLOBE, etc.

Let's look at O in position 1 and E in position 2: O E _ _ _  
Valid word: OBEYS (B, Y, S – but S is banned). So skip.  
Valid word: OBEAH (H is allowed). 5-letter word, yes. But obscure.

Let's look at O in position 4 and E in position 2: _ E _ O _  
Possible word: BELOW – B, E, L, O, W.  
Check letters: B, E, L, O, W – none banned.  
Positions: E is 2 (allowed), O is 4 (allowed).  
This seems like a strong, common 5-letter word to test.

Another possible: MELOX – not a word.  
PELOW – not a word.  
HELOW – not a word (misspelled).  
BELOW is the best candidate.
