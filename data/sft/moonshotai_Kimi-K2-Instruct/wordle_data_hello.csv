For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. Words with common consonants and vowels are good starting points. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right from the start.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).  
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word contains the letters O and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Since O and E are present, the next step is to place them in new positions and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. A good strategy is to use a word that keeps O and E while trying new consonants. A word like ""DONUT"" introduces common consonants D, N, T, and moves O to position 2, but we don’t yet know about U. A better choice is ""OCEAN"" – but it has A (already ruled out). Another option is ""OLDER"", but R is ruled out.  

A solid choice is ""OFTEN"":
- It keeps O in position 1 (possible, since O was in position 2 in AROSE).  
- Keeps E in position 4 (possible, since E was in position 5 in AROSE).  
- Introduces F, T, N – none of which have been tested yet.  

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(-), S(x), E(-)
2. OFTEN → O(-), F(x), T(x), E(-), N(x)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, F, T, N
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: O (not in position 2), E (not in position 5)
- Still available letters (untested): B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- O must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A good next word would:
- Keep O and E while moving them to new positions.
- Introduce as many new common letters as possible.

Let’s try placing O in position 3 and E in position 1 (since these positions are now open). A simple structure could be E _ O _ _. Common remaining letters are D, L, P, C, etc. A promising word that fits is ""ELOPE"". 

Check:
- E (position 1) – allowed (was in position 5 before, now new)
- L – untested
- O (position 3) – allowed (was in position 2 before, now new)
- P – untested
- E (position 5) – **NOT allowed** because E was marked (-) in position 5 in OFTEN, meaning it cannot be there. So ELOPE is invalid.

Next alternative: ""EPOCH""
- E (position 1) – allowed
- P – untested

- H – untested

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,hello,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. Words with common consonants and vowels are good starting points. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right from the start.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).  
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word contains the letters O and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Since O and E are present, the next step is to place them in new positions and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. A good strategy is to use a word that keeps O and E while trying new consonants. A word like ""DONUT"" introduces common consonants D, N, T, and moves O to position 2, but we don’t yet know about U. A better choice is ""OCEAN"" – but it has A (already ruled out). Another option is ""OLDER"", but R is ruled out.  

A solid choice is ""OFTEN"":
- It keeps O in position 1 (possible, since O was in position 2 in AROSE).  
- Keeps E in position 4 (possible, since E was in position 5 in AROSE).  
- Introduces F, T, N – none of which have been tested yet.  

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: OFTEN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) F(x) T(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(-), S(x), E(-)
2. OFTEN → O(-), F(x), T(x), E(-), N(x)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, F, T, N
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: O (not in position 2), E (not in position 5)
- Still available letters (untested): B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- O must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A good next word would:
- Keep O and E while moving them to new positions.
- Introduce as many new common letters as possible.

Let’s try placing O in position 3 and E in position 1 (since these positions are now open). A simple structure could be E _ O _ _. Common remaining letters are D, L, P, C, etc. A promising word that fits is ""ELOPE"". 

Check:
- E (position 1) – allowed (was in position 5 before, now new)
- L – untested
- O (position 3) – allowed (was in position 2 before, now new)
- P – untested
- E (position 5) – **NOT allowed** because E was marked (-) in position 5 in OFTEN, meaning it cannot be there. So ELOPE is invalid.

Next alternative: ""EPOCH""
- E (position 1) – allowed
- P – untested
- O (position 3) – allowed
- C – untested
- H – untested
This seems valid and uses new letters.

- B: allowed

3. EPOCH: E(-), P(x), O(-), C(x), H(-)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, F, T, N, P, C, H, B, W  
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: E (now known to be in position 2), L, and O  
- Positions ruled out for E: 1, 3, 4, 5 (only position 2 is allowed)  
- Positions ruled out for O: 2, 3, 4, 5 (only position 1 is allowed)

Thus, the word must be:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: E
- Contains L somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (A, R, S, F, T, N, P, C, H, B, W)

Available letters (not yet eliminated): D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""OE"" and containing L in positions 3, 4, or 5. The only common English word fitting this is ""OCELO"" (but C is eliminated) or ""OLE"" (too short). Realizing we might have to look less common, but ""OEDIP"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's re-examine - we have:
- E must be in position 2 (from BELOW feedback)
- O must be in position 1 (since all other positions are ruled out for O)
- L must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5
- The remaining letters must be from available set: D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for words starting with ""OE"" and containing L:
- OEIL is French
- OEULD isn't a word
- OEZEL isn't a word
- OEDIP isn't a word

Realizing I might have missed - the only possible English word seems to be ""OILED"" but I is allowed, L is allowed, D is allowed, and E is already in position 2, so positions would be O E I L D - but that would make ""OEILD"" which isn't valid.

Wait, let's systematically list possible patterns:
The word must be: O E ? ? ? with L in one of positions 3,4,5 and remaining letters from D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations:
1. O E L ? ? - need two more letters from available set
   Valid combinations:
   - OELDI - not a word
   - OELGM - not a word
   - OELIK - not a word
   - OELUD - ""OELUD"" isn't valid
   - OELMU - not a word
   - OELVY - not a word

2. O E ? L ? 
   - OEILD - not a word
   - OEGML - not a word
   - OEIUL - not a word
   - OEKVL - not a word

3. O E ? ? L
   - OEDIL - not a word
   - OEGIL - not a word
   - OEIKL - not a word
   - OEVYL - not a word

This suggests the word must be ""OEL"" + two more letters, but none form valid words. Realizing I might have made an error in elimination - let me re-check available letters.

Available letters: D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

The only common word that fits is ""OILED"":
- O in position 1 (required)
- E in position 2 (required)
- I allowed (not eliminated)
- L required (not eliminated)
- D allowed (not eliminated)

""OILED"" fits all constraints:
- O E I L D
- All letters from allowed set
- E in position 2 (confirmed ✓)
- O in position 1 (only remaining position)
- L in position 4 (allowed)
- No eliminated letters used
</think>

Based on the latest feedback showing E is correctly in position 2 and L must appear while O must be in position 1, the only valid English word meeting all constraints is:

- Positions ruled out for E: 1, 3, 4, 5 (only position 2 is allowed)

Thus, the word must be:
- Position 1: O

- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (A, R, S, F, T, N, P, C, H, B, W)

Available letters (not yet eliminated): D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""OE"" and containing L in positions 3, 4, or 5. The only common English word fitting this is ""OCELO"" (but C is eliminated) or ""OLE"" (too short). Realizing we might have to look less common, but ""OEDIP"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's re-examine - we have:
- E must be in position 2 (from BELOW feedback)
- O must be in position 1 (since all other positions are ruled out for O)
- L must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5
- The remaining letters must be from available set: D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,hello,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. Words with common consonants and vowels are good starting points. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right from the start.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).  
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
- S is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word contains the letters O and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Since O and E are present, the next step is to place them in new positions and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. A good strategy is to use a word that keeps O and E while trying new consonants. A word like ""DONUT"" introduces common consonants D, N, T, and moves O to position 2, but we don’t yet know about U. A better choice is ""OCEAN"" – but it has A (already ruled out). Another option is ""OLDER"", but R is ruled out.  

A solid choice is ""OFTEN"":
- It keeps O in position 1 (possible, since O was in position 2 in AROSE).  
- Keeps E in position 4 (possible, since E was in position 5 in AROSE).  
- Introduces F, T, N – none of which have been tested yet.  

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

<guess>OFTEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OFTEN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) F(x) T(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(-), S(x), E(-)
2. OFTEN → O(-), F(x), T(x), E(-), N(x)

Known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, F, T, N
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: O (not in position 2), E (not in position 5)
- Still available letters (untested): B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- O must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not 5)

A good next word would:
- Keep O and E while moving them to new positions.
- Introduce as many new common letters as possible.

Let’s try placing O in position 3 and E in position 1 (since these positions are now open). A simple structure could be E _ O _ _. Common remaining letters are D, L, P, C, etc. A promising word that fits is ""ELOPE"". 

Check:
- E (position 1) – allowed (was in position 5 before, now new)
- L – untested
- O (position 3) – allowed (was in position 2 before, now new)
- P – untested
- E (position 5) – **NOT allowed** because E was marked (-) in position 5 in OFTEN, meaning it cannot be there. So ELOPE is invalid.

Next alternative: ""EPOCH""
- E (position 1) – allowed
- P – untested
- O (position 3) – allowed
- C – untested
- H – untested
This seems valid and uses new letters.

<guess>EPOCH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: EPOCH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
2. OFTEN → O(-) F(x) T(x) E(-) N(x)
3. EPOCH → E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(-)

What we know for certain:
Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, F, T, N, P, C, H  
Letters DEFINITELY in the word: O and E  
Positions ruled out for O: 2 and 3  
Positions ruled out for E: 1, 4, and 5  

So:
- E must be in position 2 or 3  
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5  

Remaining unused letters (common ones first): B, D, G, I, K, L, M, V, W, Y, U

A quick filter for 5-letter words that
- contain O and E  
- have E in position 2 or 3  
- have O in position 1, 4, or 5  
- use only still-available letters  

Example word that satisfies:  
If we put O in position 1 and E in position 2, we need _ _ _ _ _ → O E _ _ _  
One possibility: OBEYS – but S is out  
Another: OLDEN – but N is out  
Another: OMEGA – but G and A; A is out  

Try E in position 3 and O in position 4: _ _ E O _  
Candidate: B E E O _ (invalid)  
Candidate: D I E O _ → DIEO? (no)  

Try O in position 5 and E in position 2: _ E _ _ O  
Candidate: D E M O O → DEMO? (only 4 letters)  
Candidate: G E L D O – but D is available, L is available  
""GELDO"" – not English  
""GECKO"" – C is out  
""JUMBO"" – B, O available; E must be included but not present  

Try O in position 4 and E in position 2: _ E _ O _  
Candidate: D E N O _ – N out  
Candidate: B E G O N – N out  
Candidate: V E D O R – not a word  

Try O in position 1 and E in position 3: O _ E _ _  
Candidate: O B E Y S – S out  
Candidate: O D E U M – not common  
Candidate: O V E R T – R, T out  

Finally, a real word that fits:  
B E D O N – N out  
L E M O N – N out  
B E L O W  
- B: allowed  
- E: allowed (position 2)  
- L: allowed  
- O: allowed (position 4)  
- W: allowed  

BELOW satisfies:
- Uses only still-available letters  
- Contains both required letters O and E in allowed positions  

Check positions:
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  

No conflicts.

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""OE"" and containing L in positions 3, 4, or 5. The only common English word fitting this is ""OCELO"" (but C is eliminated) or ""OLE"" (too short). Realizing we might have to look less common, but ""OEDIP"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's re-examine - we have:
- E must be in position 2 (from BELOW feedback)
- O must be in position 1 (since all other positions are ruled out for O)
- L must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5
- The remaining letters must be from available set: D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for words starting with ""OE"" and containing L:
- OEIL is French

- OEDIP isn't a word

Realizing I might have missed - the only possible English word seems to be ""OILED"" but I is allowed, L is allowed, D is allowed, and E is already in position 2, so positions would be O E I L D - but that would make ""OEILD"" which isn't valid.

Wait, let's systematically list possible patterns:
The word must be: O E ? ? ? with L in one of positions 3,4,5 and remaining letters from D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Known letters:
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  
- L is in the word but we don’t yet know its exact spot.  
- O is in the word but never in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (every previous guess placed it somewhere and it was always marked “-”).  
  That leaves **only position 5** for O.  
- Letters definitely **not** in the word:  
  A, R, S, F, T, N, P, C, H, B, W, I, D.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:

_ E _ _ O

and must contain L somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (it can’t be 1, 2, or 5 because those are taken by unknown, E, and O respectively).

Still-allowed consonants (not yet ruled out):  
G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  (plus L which we already know is present)

We now need a 5-letter English word of the form  
? E ? L O  
or  
? E L ? O

Scanning common vocabulary:

- G E L D O – not a standard word  
- G E L L O – “gello” isn’t standard  
- J E L L O – valid brand name, but usually written in capitals and considered slang; may not be accepted  
- V E L L O – not a word  
- K E L S O – proper noun, not suitable  
- M E L L O – slang spelling of “mellow” but again not standard  
- U E L L O – not a word  
- Q, X, Z, Y give no familiar words in this pattern

The only widely accepted English word left fitting the pattern is:

J E L L O

Even though it’s a trademark, it is listed as an acceptable 5-letter English word in most Scrabble and Wordle word lists, and every letter is still allowed.
