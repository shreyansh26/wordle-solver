For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. I should use letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Let me analyze the feedback from AROSE:
1. A is not in the word (x)
2. R is not in the word (x)
3. O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
4. S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
5. E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3
- It contains S somewhere
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E
- The remaining possible letters must come from: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 5. 

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated. Since we've eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O (already placed), U. Consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, etc.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3 and tries new common letters. ""CLOUD"" comes to mind, but we already know S is in the word, so that's not ideal. 

Let me think of words with O in the middle and S somewhere. 

Possible structures:
- S _ O _ _
- _ S O _ _
- _ _ O _ S

Looking for common words: STONE (but E is eliminated), SPOON (but P and N are fine), SLOTH (but H is less common), STOIC (but C is good).

Actually, let me try words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. ""POINT"" - but contains I,N,T which are good, but S must be included. 

Wait, let me think differently - since S is in the word but not position 4, and O is in position 3, maybe something like:

""STOCK"" - S T O C K
But we don't know about T, C, K yet.

""SNOUT"" - S N O U T
This uses S (must be present), O (correct position), and tests N, U, T.

This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. Since O is in position 3 and S is somewhere else, and we've eliminated A,R,E, let's try a word that tests new common letters while keeping these constraints.

""CLOUD"" doesn't have S. ""SOUND"" has S,O,U,N,D - S could be position 1 (not 4), O is position 3. This tests S, U, N, D while keeping O correct.

SOUND seems like a strong next guess.

But wait, let me check if S is in position 1 - that would be fine since position 4 is excluded for S. So SOUND would test:
- S in position 1 (if S is actually there, this would give ✓)
- O in position 3 (✓, already known)
- U, N, D as new letters

This seems optimal.

1. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct first position.  
2. O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position here, even though we thought it was fixed at position 3 from AROSE. This seems contradictory at first glance, but looking back:  
   - In AROSE, position 3 was marked ✓, which meant O was definitely in that slot.  
   - In SOUND, position 2 is marked -, which means O is in the word but wrong position for this guess (position 2). This is impossible if O must be at position 3.  
   Therefore, the only consistent reading is: the ✓ from AROSE fixed O at position 3, so in SOUND the feedback for O(-) actually confirms O is NOT at position 2 (which we already knew), and the - simply re-iterates O is present elsewhere (position 3). The new information is about the other letters.

3. U(x), N(x), D(x) – none of these letters appear in the secret word.

- O is the third letter.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, U, N, D.

Remaining unused common letters include T, L, I, C, K, M, P, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: S _ O _ _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S T O I C (STOIC) – uses T, I, C which are all allowed and common.
- S P O I L (SPOIL) – but L is allowed, but we can test more letters with STOIC.
- S H O R T – but R is forbidden.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. I should use letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me analyze the feedback from AROSE:
1. A is not in the word (x)
2. R is not in the word (x)
3. O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
4. S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
5. E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3
- It contains S somewhere
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E
- The remaining possible letters must come from: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 5. 

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated. Since we've eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O (already placed), U. Consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, etc.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3 and tries new common letters. ""CLOUD"" comes to mind, but we already know S is in the word, so that's not ideal. 

Let me think of words with O in the middle and S somewhere. 

Possible structures:
- S _ O _ _
- _ S O _ _
- _ _ O _ S

Looking for common words: STONE (but E is eliminated), SPOON (but P and N are fine), SLOTH (but H is less common), STOIC (but C is good).

Actually, let me try words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. ""POINT"" - but contains I,N,T which are good, but S must be included. 

Wait, let me think differently - since S is in the word but not position 4, and O is in position 3, maybe something like:

""STOCK"" - S T O C K
But we don't know about T, C, K yet.

""SNOUT"" - S N O U T
This uses S (must be present), O (correct position), and tests N, U, T.

This seems good.

But actually, let me think more systematically. Since O is in position 3 and S is somewhere else, and we've eliminated A,R,E, let's try a word that tests new common letters while keeping these constraints.

""CLOUD"" doesn't have S. ""SOUND"" has S,O,U,N,D - S could be position 1 (not 4), O is position 3. This tests S, U, N, D while keeping O correct.

SOUND seems like a strong next guess.

But wait, let me check if S is in position 1 - that would be fine since position 4 is excluded for S. So SOUND would test:
- S in position 1 (if S is actually there, this would give ✓)
- O in position 3 (✓, already known)
- U, N, D as new letters

This seems optimal.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me parse the new feedback from SOUND:

1. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct first position.  
2. O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position here, even though we thought it was fixed at position 3 from AROSE. This seems contradictory at first glance, but looking back:  
   - In AROSE, position 3 was marked ✓, which meant O was definitely in that slot.  
   - In SOUND, position 2 is marked -, which means O is in the word but wrong position for this guess (position 2). This is impossible if O must be at position 3.  
   Therefore, the only consistent reading is: the ✓ from AROSE fixed O at position 3, so in SOUND the feedback for O(-) actually confirms O is NOT at position 2 (which we already knew), and the - simply re-iterates O is present elsewhere (position 3). The new information is about the other letters.

3. U(x), N(x), D(x) – none of these letters appear in the secret word.

So far we have:
- S is the first letter.
- O is the third letter.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E, U, N, D.

Remaining unused common letters include T, L, I, C, K, M, P, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: S _ O _ _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- S T O I C (STOIC) – uses T, I, C which are all allowed and common.
- S P O I L (SPOIL) – but L is allowed, but we can test more letters with STOIC.
- S H O R T – but R is forbidden.
- S C O P E – but E is forbidden.

STOIC looks best, testing T, I, C as new letters in positions 2, 4, 5.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. From AROSE:
   - Position 3 must be O (✓).
   - S is somewhere, but not position 4 (-).
   - A, R, E are not in the word (x).

2. From SOUND:
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - O is not in position 2 (-) — but we already knew it’s in position 3.
   - U, N, D are not in the word (x).

3. From STOIC:
   - S is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
   - O is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
   - T, I, C are not in the word (x).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, U, N, D, T, I, C.

Pattern so far: S _ O _ _

We need two more letters, neither of which are any of the forbidden ones.

Available letters (common ones first):
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible 5-letter words with pattern S _ O _ _ using allowed letters:
- S P O K E  (E is forbidden)  
- S H O C K  (C is forbidden)  
- S L O P Y  (Y is allowed, but let’s check letters: S L O P Y — L and P are allowed, Y is allowed)  
- S L O P Y seems valid: S L O P Y → S ✓, L ?, O ✓, P ?, Y ?

But we need to check if all letters are allowed: L, P, Y have not been marked x yet.

Other options: S M O K E (E, K forbidden?), K not forbidden yet, but E is.

S L O P Y seems valid.

Let’s double-check: letters used S, L, O, P, Y — none are in the forbidden list.

Yes, S L O P Y is a legal guess that fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I should use letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter)\n\nThis gives me a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let me analyze the feedback from AROSE:\n1. A is not in the word (x)\n2. R is not in the word (x)\n3. O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)\n4. S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)\n5. E is not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has O in position 3\n- It contains S somewhere\n- It does NOT contain A, R, or E\n- The remaining possible letters must come from: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nSince S is in the word but not in position 4, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 5. \n\nGood next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated. Since we\'ve eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O (already placed), U. Consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, etc.\n\nI\'ll try a word that keeps O in position 3 and tries new common letters. ""CLOUD"" comes to mind, but we already know S is in the word, so that\'s not ideal. \n\nLet me think of words with O in the middle and S somewhere. \n\nPossible structures:\n- S _ O _ _\n- _ S O _ _\n- _ _ O _ S\n\nLooking for common words: STONE (but E is eliminated), SPOON (but P and N are fine), SLOTH (but H is less common), STOIC (but C is good).\n\nActually, let me try words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. ""POINT"" - but contains I,N,T which are good, but S must be included. \n\nWait, let me think differently - since S is in the word but not position 4, and O is in position 3, maybe something like:\n\n""STOCK"" - S T O C K\nBut we don\'t know about T, C, K yet.\n\n""SNOUT"" - S N O U T\nThis uses S (must be present), O (correct position), and tests N, U, T.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut actually, let me think more systematically. Since O is in position 3 and S is somewhere else, and we\'ve eliminated A,R,E, let\'s try a word that tests new common letters while keeping these constraints.\n\n""CLOUD"" doesn\'t have S. ""SOUND"" has S,O,U,N,D - S could be position 1 (not 4), O is position 3. This tests S, U, N, D while keeping O correct.\n\nSOUND seems like a strong next guess.\n\nBut wait, let me check if S is in position 1 - that would be fine since position 4 is excluded for S. So SOUND would test:\n- S in position 1 (if S is actually there, this would give ✓)\n- O in position 3 (✓, already known)\n- U, N, D as new letters\n\nThis seems optimal.\n\n<guess>SOUND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let me parse the new feedback from SOUND:\n\n1. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct first position.  \n2. O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position here, even though we thought it was fixed at position 3 from AROSE. This seems contradictory at first glance, but looking back:  \n   - In AROSE, position 3 was marked ✓, which meant O was definitely in that slot.  \n   - In SOUND, position 2 is marked -, which means O is in the word but wrong position for this guess (position 2). This is impossible if O must be at position 3.  \n   Therefore, the only consistent reading is: the ✓ from AROSE fixed O at position 3, so in SOUND the feedback for O(-) actually confirms O is NOT at position 2 (which we already knew), and the - simply re-iterates O is present elsewhere (position 3).

Current known facts after four guesses:
- The word pattern is S _ O _ _ (positions 1 and 3 fixed).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, U, N, D, T, I, C, L, P, Y
- Allowed letters for positions 2 and 4: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

The only common letters left are B, F, G, H, K, M. We need to find a valid English word that fits S _ O _ _ using these remaining letters.

Let’s list possibilities quickly:
- S B O _ _ : No common 5-letter words
- S F O _ _ : No common words
- S G O _ _ : No common words
- S H O _ _ : “SHOCK” but C is forbidden, “SHOWN” but N is forbidden, “SHOGI” but I is forbidden, “SHOGY” but Y is forbidden
- S K O _ _ : “SKOSH” but S appears twice, “SKORT” but T,R are forbidden, “SKOFF” but F appears twice
- S M O _ _ : “SMOCK” but C is forbidden, “SMOG” is only 4 letters, “SMOKE” but K,E are allowed? Wait, E is forbidden.
- S H O G G : Not a word
- S H O K K : Not a word
- S H O K _ : “SHOKU” but U is forbidden
- S H O K Y : Y is forbidden
- Actually, let me check “SHOCK” again: S H O C K – C is forbidden.
- Next: “SHOOK” – S H O O K. Letters are S, H, O, O, K. All letters are allowed (H, K not forbidden). This is a valid English word.

Therefore, the only reasonable remaining guess is SHOOK.
