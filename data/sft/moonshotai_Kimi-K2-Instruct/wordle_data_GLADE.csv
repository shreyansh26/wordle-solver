For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. According to frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to test as many different letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most frequent in English
2. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the amount of information we get
3. These letters appear in many possible 5-letter words, so the feedback will be very informative

- R: not in the word (x)  
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in the correct position, i.e., last letter (✓)

So we know:
1. E is the 5th letter.
2. A is somewhere in positions 1–4.
3. R, O, S are not in the word at all.

Letters left to explore that are common in English and haven’t been ruled out: T, L, N, I, D, C, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A (not in 1st position) and avoids R, O, S.

Possible structures: _ _ _ _ E with A somewhere among the first four letters.

Good candidate words: ""irate"" (but R is excluded), ""alien"" (but O is excluded), ""anile"", ""angle"" (g and n), ""amend""... ""tinea"" is too obscure...

A balanced choice that uses frequent letters and fits constraints: ""alien""
- A in position 2 (allowed since only position 1 was ruled out for A)
- Common letters L, I, N to test
- Ends in E as required
- No R, O, S

But wait, ""alien"" has I in position 3, L in 2, A in 1 - actually A would be position 1 here, but feedback said A is in word but wrong position, meaning A cannot be in position 1 (as it was in arose). So ""alien"" would have A in position 1 again - that's invalid.

Better choice: ""plane"" - but has A in position 4 (allowed), L, N, P to test, ends in E, no R/O/S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

3. R, O, S are not in the word at all.

Letters left to explore that are common in English and haven’t been ruled out: T, L, N, I, D, C, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A (not in 1st position) and avoids R, O, S.

Possible structures: _ _ _ _ E with A somewhere among the first four letters.

Good candidate words: ""irate"" (but R is excluded), ""alien"" (but O is excluded), ""anile"", ""angle"" (g and n), ""amend""... ""tinea"" is too obscure...

A balanced choice that uses frequent letters and fits constraints: ""alien""
- A in position 2 (allowed since only position 1 was ruled out for A)
- Common letters L, I, N to test
- Ends in E as required
- No R, O, S

But wait, ""alien"" has I in position 3, L in 2, A in 1 - actually A would be position 1 here, but feedback said A is in word but wrong position, meaning A cannot be in position 1 (as it was in arose). So ""alien"" would have A in position 1 again - that's invalid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- R: not in the word (x)  
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in the correct position, i.e., last letter (✓)

So we know:
1. E is the 5th letter.
2. A is somewhere in positions 1–4.
3. R, O, S are not in the word at all.

Letters left to explore that are common in English and haven’t been ruled out: T, L, N, I, D, C, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A (not in 1st position) and avoids R, O, S.

Possible structures: _ _ _ _ E with A somewhere among the first four letters.

Good candidate words: ""irate"" (but R is excluded), ""alien"" (but O is excluded), ""anile"", ""angle"" (g and n), ""amend""... ""tinea"" is too obscure...

A balanced choice that uses frequent letters and fits constraints: ""alien""
- A in position 2 (allowed since only position 1 was ruled out for A)
- Common letters L, I, N to test
- Ends in E as required
- No R, O, S

But wait, ""alien"" has I in position 3, L in 2, A in 1 - actually A would be position 1 here, but feedback said A is in word but wrong position, meaning A cannot be in position 1 (as it was in arose). So ""alien"" would have A in position 1 again - that's invalid.

Better choice: ""plane"" - but has A in position 4 (allowed), L, N, P to test, ends in E, no R/O/S.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: plane -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:
1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ E is fixed in 5th place; A is in the word but not 1st; R, O, S are out.
2. plane → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ P, N out; L is correct in 2nd; A is correct in 3rd; E still 5th.

Current pattern:
_ L A _ E   (positions 2, 3, 5 locked)

Letters still valid to test: major consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels I, U (A already placed).

Common 5-letter words fitting _L_A_E:
- CLADE
- FLAKE
- GLADE
- SLATE (but S is out)
- BLAME
- PLACE (P is out)
- FRAME (R out)

“FLAKE” uses common letters F, K (both untested) and keeps A, L, E in place. It doesn’t reuse any excluded letters.

Guess 3: flake -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:
1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is the 5th letter.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so far tested in positions 1 and 3).
   – R, O, S are not in the word.

2. plane → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   – L is correctly in position 2.
   – A is correctly in position 3.
   – P and N are not in the word.
   – E is still 5th.

3. flake → F(x) L(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)
   – F and K are not in the word.
   – L, A, E remain locked in positions 2, 3, 5.

So the pattern is currently:
_ L A _ E

Letters already eliminated: R, O, S, P, N, F, K.

Letters still possible for positions 1 and 4 (and they must be different and not in the eliminated set):
B, C, D, G, H, I, J, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus vowels I, U).

We need a common word matching _ L A _ E.

Possible candidates:
- BLADE (D tried? No, D not tried yet)
- GLARE (R is out)
- CLAVE
- SLAVE (S is out)
- GLAZE (Z possible but less common)
- BLAME (M not tried)

""BLADE"" fits:
- B not yet tested
- D not yet tested
- Keeps L, A, E correct
- Uses no eliminated letters

Let’s choose BLADE.

Among common English 5-letter words ending “LADE”, the only everyday one is “CLADE”.  
Check constraints:
- C has not been tried or ruled out.  
- No forbidden letters appear.  
- Fits exact pattern _ L A D E.

Therefore, the secret word must be CLADE.
