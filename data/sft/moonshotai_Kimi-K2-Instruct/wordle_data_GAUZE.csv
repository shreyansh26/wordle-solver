For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, or O. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word ends with E.

We know:
1. Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 cannot be S, L, T.
2. A is present but not in position 3.
3. E is fixed at position 5.

To maximize coverage of remaining common letters while avoiding the excluded ones, we can pick a word that includes other common consonants and vowels like R, N, D, C, H, M, B, etc. ""CRANE"" is a strong follow-up because it uses:
- C, R, N (common consonants not yet tested)
- A (which we know is in the word, just not in position 3)
- E (already confirmed at position 5)

However, since the 4th letter must be E (from feedback), we need to adjust. A better word would be ""CRANE"" shifted to fit E at the end, but let's choose something that directly tests new letters in possible positions. ""CRANE"" doesn't fit because A is in position 3 (where we know it's wrong). 

Instead, let's pick ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R, E
- E is at position 5 (correct)
- Tests C, H, O, R, and positions A could be in (but A isn't here, so this is a flaw in this approach - we might need to include A).

Re-evaluating, we should include A but not in position 3. ""ADORE"" uses A in position 1, D, O, R, and E at 5. But D isn't tested yet. Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" - but A is in position 4 and E is in 5, and we know A isn't in 3 so this could work, but C is in position 2 which is new. 

Best choice seems ""ADORE"":

1. SLATE → A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is fixed at position 5.
2. ADORE → A is not in position 1 either (feedback “-” again), and D, O, R are out.

So far we have:

Letter pool:
- Confirmed letters: A (somewhere), E at 5.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, D, O, R.

Positions:
- Positions 1, 2, 3 can’t be the above eliminated letters.
- Position 5 is E.
- A is not in 1 or 3, so A must be in 2 or 4.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses A in position 2 or 4.
- Avoids all the eliminated letters.
- Uses remaining common consonants: C, N, M, G, H, B, F, etc.

Good candidates:
- If A is at 2: _A__E. Example: CABLE (but B and L eliminated), so CANE? Needs 5 letters.
- Actually, CANE? is 4 letters. CAKE? K is still possible.
- CAKE? is 4 letters. CAFFE? Not valid.
- CAINE? Not an English word.
- FABLE? B and L eliminated.
- So maybe A at 4: __A_E.
  - CHAFE: C, H, A, F, E. Uses C, H, F (none eliminated yet) and places A at 4, which is allowed.
  - GNAWE: G, N, A, W, E. G, N, W are new.
  - MAIZE: Z is possible, but Z is less common.
  - PACE? 4 letters.
  - CHAFE seems the best: all letters untested and common.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses A in position 2 or 4.
- Avoids all the eliminated letters.
- Uses remaining common consonants: C, N, M, G, H, B, F, etc.

Good candidates:
- If A is at 2: _A__E. Example: CABLE (but B and L eliminated), so CANE? Needs 5 letters.
- Actually, CANE? is 4 letters. CAKE? K is still possible.
- CAKE? is 4 letters. CAFFE? Not valid.
- CAINE? Not an English word.
- FABLE? B and L eliminated.
- So maybe A at 4: __A_E.
  - CHAFE: C, H, A, F, E. Uses C, H, F (none eliminated yet) and places A at 4, which is allowed.
  - GNAWE: G, N, A, W, E. G, N, W are new.
  - MAIZE: Z is possible, but Z is less common.
  - PACE? 4 letters.
  - CHAFE seems the best: all letters untested and common.

Thus, CHAFE is a good third guess.

Step 1 – summarize what we now know  
• Position 5 is definitely E.  
• The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback on SLATE, ADORE, CHAFE).  
  – Therefore A must be in position 2: _ A _ _ E  
• Eliminated consonants so far: S, L, T, D, O, R, C, H, F.  
  – Still allowed consonants: B, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
• We have not yet tested any of B, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
• We have not yet tested the vowels I or U.

Step 2 – choose a word shape  
Required pattern: _ A _ _ E  
We need three different consonants in positions 1, 3, 4, none of which have been ruled out, and we’d like to test as many fresh letters as possible.

Step 3 – pick the best candidate  
A common English word that fits _ A _ _ E and uses fresh letters is “BARGE”.  
- B, R, G: R was already eliminated (Guess 2), so R is out – BARGE is invalid.  
Try “GAMER”: G, A, M, E, R – R is out.  
Try “NAIVE”: N, A, I, V, E – uses N, I, V (all fresh).  
- Pattern: N A I V E → fits _ A _ _ E  
- All letters are allowed (N, I, V not yet eliminated).  
- It tests the new vowel I and two new consonants N and V.

Hence, NAIVE is the optimal next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word often includes letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, or O. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).

We know:
1. Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 cannot be S, L, T.
2. A is present but not in position 3.
3. E is fixed at position 5.

To maximize coverage of remaining common letters while avoiding the excluded ones, we can pick a word that includes other common consonants and vowels like R, N, D, C, H, M, B, etc. ""CRANE"" is a strong follow-up because it uses:
- C, R, N (common consonants not yet tested)

5. Still-available vowels (not yet tested):

We need three consonants (positions 1, 3, 4) that:
   - do not appear in the eliminated list,
   - together with the fixed A and E form a valid 5-letter English word.

Search for common _ A _ _ E words:
   - BAGGE – invalid (double G not common 5-letter word)
   - GAMBE – rare or obsolete
   - JAMBE – obsolete
   - MARGE – R eliminated
   - PAGLE – not a word
   - WAGED – D eliminated
   - MAUVE – uses U and V, but V eliminated
   - KNAVE – K, N, A, V, E: N and V eliminated
   - PAWNE – not a word
   - GABLE – L eliminated
   - JAMES – S eliminated

The only common remaining word that fits is “GAMBE” (variant spelling of “gambol”), but it’s obscure.  
Another valid, more common word is “MAUZE” – not in standard dictionaries.

Re-examining the remaining consonants, a very common word is “MAIZE”, but I is eliminated.  

Next common word: “MAPLE” – L eliminated.  

“PAGLE” is not valid.  

Actually, we missed “GAUGE” – G, A, U, G, E – but G and U and G, and it doesn’t fit _ A _ _ E.

Wait – the pattern _ A _ _ E with fresh letters: “MAUVE” uses U and V; V is eliminated.

Looking again, “BAKER” – B, A, K, E, R – R eliminated.

“BARGE” – R eliminated.

“GAFFE” – F eliminated.

“GABLE” – L eliminated.

“JAMES” – S eliminated.

“KNAVE” – N and V eliminated.

“PAWNE” – N eliminated.

“WAGUE” – not a word.

“ZAMBE” – not a word.

“GAMER” – R eliminated.

“GAMBE” is obscure; next best common word is “GABLE”, but L is out.

“BAYLE” – L eliminated.

“PACED” – D eliminated.

“WAGED” – D eliminated.

“WAFER” – R eliminated.

“GAMBE” is obscure but still valid in some dictionaries.  
However, a more common valid word is “GAZER”, but R and Z are allowed? R is eliminated.  

Wait – let’s list possible consonants for each spot:

Position 1: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Position 3: same  
Position 4: same  

We need letters not eliminated.  

Try “MAIZE” – I eliminated.  

“MAUVE” – V eliminated.  

“BAGEL” – L eliminated.  

“JAMBE” – B is okay, but word is obsolete.

“JAMBE” is valid in Scrabble dictionaries.

Yet there’s a very common word: “GAMER”, but R eliminated.

Looking back, we missed “GAUZE” – G, A, U, Z, E – uses G, A, U, Z, E.  
Letters: G, U, Z – none eliminated.  
Word pattern: G A U Z E → _ A _ _ E  
This is a common word.

Therefore the best next guess is GAUZE.
