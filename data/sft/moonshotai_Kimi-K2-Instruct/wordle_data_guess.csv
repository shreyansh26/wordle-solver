For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about the secret word's letters. The optimal first word should contain common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. 

One of the most recommended starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 major vowels (A, O, E) and useful consonants (R, S)
- Very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- Good letter distribution across positions

This will help me quickly determine:
1. Which vowels are in the word
2. Whether R or S are present
3. Whether any of these letters are in their correct positions

Other strong alternatives would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's particularly good for identifying vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains S in the 4th spot ( _ _ _ S _ ).
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th spot (so E could be in 1, 2, 3).
- Letters A, R, O are completely absent.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Has E somewhere other than the 5th position.
3. Does not use A, R, or O.

A good next step is to test common consonants and vowels that haven't been ruled out yet. The remaining vowels are I and U. Common consonants not ruled out yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

I’ll look for a word that places E in position 1, 2, or 3, and has S in position 4. One such word is “LENSE”:
- L, E, N, S, E.
- But E appears twice, and we don’t know if E can appear twice. Also, E is in position 5, which we know is invalid.

Another candidate: “PINES”:
- P, I, N, E, S.
- Here, S is in position 5, but we need S in position 4. So this is invalid.

Wait, we need S in position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ S _. Let me think of words ending in S, but with E somewhere in positions 1-3.

Valid candidates:
- “DESKS” – but K hasn’t been tested yet, and E is in position 2. This fits: D, E, S, K, S. But S is in position 3 here, not 4. Wait, no: DESKS is D-E-S-K-S, so S is in position 3 and 5, but we need position 4 to be S. So this is incorrect.

Correct structure: _ _ _ S _. Let me list words matching this:
- “BLESS” – B, L, E, S, S. S is in position 4, E is in position 3. No A, R, O. This seems valid.
- “GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S. S is in position 4, E is in position 3. No A, R, O. Also valid.
- “TRESS” – T, R, E, S, S. But R is excluded, so invalid.

Between “BLESS” and “GUESS”, both fit, but “GUESS” includes U, which is an untested vowel, giving more information. So I’ll choose “GUESS”.
