Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a strong starting word that uses common letters. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two high-frequency consonants (R, S), which should help identify letters quickly.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, I, S, O, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: E (now fixed at position 5), R (somewhere, but not yet 2 or 5)  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1  
   - R is in the word but neither position 2 nor 5  
   - E is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So for the third guess we want:
- R to appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4  
- T to appear in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E)  
- E fixed at position 5  
- No A, I, S, O, N anywhere  
- Introduce three new common letters, avoiding the eliminated set

Candidate letters left that are still useful and common: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A strong candidate that satisfies all of the above is “UTTER”:
- U (new vowel), T (moved to position 2), T (new placement), E (fixed at 5), R (moved to 4)

But let’s check constraints:
   – R in position 4 is allowed (not 2 or 5) ✓  
   – T in position 2 is allowed (not 1) ✓  
   – Uses no forbidden letters ✓  
   – Uses E at 5 ✓  

Alternative: “CRUEL” – but E is already locked at 5, so CRUEL won’t fit.  
Another candidate: “LURED” – but D is acceptable, yet E is already at 5, so that would repeat E at 4 and 5 – invalid.

Best straightforward word respecting all constraints: “UTTER”.

However, we still need to make sure we test new letters efficiently. Another good choice is “RUGBY” – but E is missing, so invalid.

Next best seems “UTTER”.

But to maximize fresh letter coverage while still placing R and T, another candidate: “TRUCE” – but C is allowed, U allowed, E fixed at 5, R anywhere except 2 – let’s try R at 1 and T at 2.  
TRUCE:  
- T at 2 ✓ (not 1)  
- R at 1 ✓ (allowed)  
- E at 5 ✓  
- U and C new letters ✓  

Therefore, “TRUCE” is a strong, compliant next guess.

- T is NOT in positions 1 or 2 (Guess 2 and 3 feedback “T(-)”).  
- R is NOT in positions 2 or 4 (Guess 1 and 3 feedback “R(-)”).  

So possible positions:

2. Places T in 3/4/5, R in 1/3/5, E in 1/2/3/4.  
3. Adds two fresh common letters that are not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none except E (already required)

Candidate words:
- HERTY – invalid (Y is okay, but HERTY not a common word)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, I, S
- Letters somewhere in the word, but not yet placed: R, E
- Positions still completely unknown for R and E
- No constraints on consonants B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A balanced next guess should:
1. Place R and E in new positions to test where they can fit.
2. Introduce 3 new common letters to maximize new information.
3. Avoid A, I, S completely.

Good next candidate letters: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, etc.

Possible candidate words (avoiding A, I, S):
- TONER (uses T, O, N, E, R)
- LURED (L, U, R, E, D)
- CREPT (C, R, E, P, T)

I'll choose ""TONER"" because:
- It moves E to position 4 and R to position 5 (positions they haven't been in).
- Introduces very common letters T, O, N.
- No repeat of forbidden letters A, I, S.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, I, S, O, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: E (now fixed at position 5), R (somewhere, but not yet 2 or 5)  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1  
   - R is in the word but neither position 2 nor 5  
   - E is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So for the third guess we want:
- R to appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 4  
- T to appear in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E)  
- E fixed at position 5  
- No A, I, S, O, N anywhere  
- Introduce three new common letters, avoiding the eliminated set

Candidate letters left that are still useful and common: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A strong candidate that satisfies all of the above is “UTTER”:
- U (new vowel), T (moved to position 2), T (new placement), E (fixed at 5), R (moved to 4)

But let’s check constraints:
   – R in position 4 is allowed (not 2 or 5) ✓  
   – T in position 2 is allowed (not 1) ✓  
   – Uses no forbidden letters ✓  
   – Uses E at 5 ✓  

Alternative: “CRUEL” – but E is already locked at 5, so CRUEL won’t fit.  
Another candidate: “LURED” – but D is acceptable, yet E is already at 5, so that would repeat E at 4 and 5 – invalid.

Best straightforward word respecting all constraints: “UTTER”.

However, we still need to make sure we test new letters efficiently. Another good choice is “RUGBY” – but E is missing, so invalid.

Next best seems “UTTER”.

But to maximize fresh letter coverage while still placing R and T, another candidate: “TRUCE” – but C is allowed, U allowed, E fixed at 5, R anywhere except 2 – let’s try R at 1 and T at 2.  
TRUCE:  
- T at 2 ✓ (not 1)  
- R at 1 ✓ (allowed)  
- E at 5 ✓  
- U and C new letters ✓  

Therefore, “TRUCE” is a strong, compliant next guess.

Let's integrate the new feedback from BERTH:

- B: x → not in the word
- E: – → E is in the word, but NOT in position 2
- R: ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 3 (fixed!)
- T: – → T is in the word, but NOT in position 4
- H: x → not in the word

Summary of current knowledge:
Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, I, S, O, N, U, C, B, H  
Known letters in the word: R (fixed at position 3), E, T  
Positions eliminated:
- E cannot be in 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 3)
- T cannot be in 1, 2, or 4 (from Guess 2, 3, 4)
- R is fixed at position 3

So:
- R is locked at 3
- T must be in position 5 (only remaining spot for T)
- E must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining spots for E)  
We need two more letters (positions 2 and either 1 or 4) from the remaining alphabet: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus repeat checking of common consonants.

   - E must be 1 or 4
   - Let's try E at 1: E _ R _ T → need letters for 2 and 4
   - E G R E T → but E repeats, and we know E appears only once
   - E V R E T → same issue
   - E A R L T → A not allowed
   - E D R Y T → possible, but E at 1, need to check if EDRYT is a word → not valid
   - E F R E T → invalid
   - E L R I T → invalid
2. _ _ R E T:
   - E at 4
   - Then position 1 and 2 must be new letters
   - D R E E T → E repeat invalid
   - F R E E T → invalid
   - G R E E T → invalid
   - L E R T T → invalid
   - Wait, better approach: fixed positions R3, T5, E4:
   - _ _ R E T → letters for 1 and 2
   - F L R E T → FLRET not a word
   - P L R E T → PLRET not a word
   - G R E E T → invalid
   - D R E A T → A invalid
   - G R E E T → invalid
   - F R E E T → invalid
   - Actually, the only valid English word seems to be:
   - G R E E T → but E repeats
   - P R E E T → invalid
   - D R E E T → invalid
   - Wait, we need a word with R3, T5, and single E in the remaining spots
   - Let me re-examine possible words:
   - With R at 3 and T at 5, and E at 1 or 4:
   - E _ R _ T:
     - E D R I T → invalid (I not allowed)
     - E L R O T → O not allowed
     - E L R Y T → valid: ELRYT? Not a word
   - _ _ R E T:
     - F L R E T → not a word
     - G R E E T → E repeat
     - D R E E T → invalid
     - P R E E T → invalid
   - Hmm, let me list possible remaining letters and construct:
   - Available consonants: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - No vowels left except E
   - So we must have E in 1 or 4
   - Let's try E at 1:
     - Structure: E _ R _ T
     - Need valid 5-letter word: E _ R _ T
     - E G R O T → O invalid
     - E L R I T → I invalid
     - E D R A T → A invalid
     - E L R Y T → not a word
     - E P R O T → O invalid
     - E L R E T → E repeat
   - E at 4:
     - Structure: _ _ R E T
     - Valid words: F L R E T → not a word
     - G R E E T → E repeat
     - M U R E T → U invalid
     - P R E E T → invalid
     - D R E E T → invalid
     - V E R E T → invalid
     - Y E R E T → invalid
   - This seems problematic. Let me re-examine the fixed positions:
     - R is definitely at position 3 (✓)
     - T must be at 5 (only remaining spot)
     - E must be at 1 or 4
     - Possible words:
       - E G R E T → E repeat, invalid
       - E X R E T → X available but not common
       - E W R E T → invalid
       - Actually, the valid word is ""EGRET"" but has E twice which we can't have
     - Perhaps I missed a placement: let me check if E can be at 2 - no, E cannot be at 2 (from BERTH feedback)
     - Wait, is there any other combination?
     - Let me try E at 1:
       - E _ R _ T
       - Possible letters for 2 and 4 from remaining: D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
       - E D R Y T → not a word
       - E L R Y T → not a word
       - E M R Y T → not a word
     - E at 4:
       - _ _ R E T
       - D R E E T → invalid
       - F R E E T → invalid
       - G R E E T → invalid
       - P R E E T → invalid
     - It seems the only valid English word fitting R3, T5, and single E is ""EGRET"" but it has E twice which contradicts single-letter occurrence
     - Re-evaluate: maybe I made an error in T placement. T cannot be at 1,2,4, so must be at 5 or 3. But R is at 3, so T must be at 5
     - Similarly, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so must be at 1 or 4
     - The only valid 5-letter word with R at 3, T at 5, and single E at 1 or 4 is... let me list:
     - E L R E T → invalid (E repeat)
     - E D R E T → invalid
     - Actually, the word is ""EGRET"" but it has E twice
     - This suggests no valid single-E word fits, implying an error in earlier assumptions
     - Re-examining: the feedback shows E is in the word, but never fixed how many times. Could there be two Es?
     - The feedback only indicates presence, not count. So ""EGRET"" is possible even with two Es
     - Checking dictionary: EGRET is a valid 5-letter word (a type of bird)
     - Structure: E G R E T
     - Positions: E1, G2, R3, E4, T5
     - This satisfies:
       - R at 3 ✓
       - T at 5 ✓
       - E appears at 1 and 4 (both allowed positions)
       - G is a new consonant not yet tested
     - This seems to be the only valid candidate
</think>

We now know:
- R is fixed at position 3.
- T must be at position 5 (the only spot left for T).
- E must appear at least once, and cannot be in positions 2 or 5; the only possible single-word fit is **EGRET**.

<guess>EGRET</guess>",EGRET,"Let's integrate the new feedback from BERTH:

- B: x → not in the word
- E: – → E is in the word, but NOT in position 2
- R: ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 3 (fixed!)
- T: – → T is in the word, but NOT in position 4
- H: x → not in the word

Summary of current knowledge:
Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, I, S, O, N, U, C, B, H  
Known letters in the word: R (fixed at position 3), E, T  
Positions eliminated:
- E cannot be in 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 3)
- T cannot be in 1, 2, or 4 (from Guess 2, 3, 4)
- R is fixed at position 3

So:
- R is locked at 3
- T must be in position 5 (only remaining spot for T)
- E must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining spots for E)  
We need two more letters (positions 2 and either 1 or 4) from the remaining alphabet: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus repeat checking of common consonants.
