This is the first guess, so I have no information about the secret word. My strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English, especially vowels and frequently used consonants, to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize information gain

The word ""RAISE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- R: very common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of common letters without repeats.

From the feedback so far:
- Pattern is _ _ A S E (A in 3, S in 4, E in 5).
- Letters already ruled out: R, I, C, H, B, L.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2, drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding the six letters above). Common remaining consonants include D, F, G, K, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Let’s find a valid word that:
- has the form _ _ A S E
- uses none of R I C H B L
- introduces two new letters.

Possible stems:
- D _ A S E → no common 5-letter word like “DRASE” (R out), “DFASE” invalid
- F _ A S E → “FLASE” invalid (L out)
- G _ A S E → “GRASE” invalid (R out), “GLASE” invalid
- M _ A S E → “MRASE” invalid
- N _ A S E → “NRASE” invalid
- P _ A S E → “PRASE” invalid
- T _ A S E → “TRASE” invalid
- W _ A S E → “WRASE” invalid
- K _ A S E → “KRASE” invalid
- ... but “PHASE” is valid and uses P and H – but H is already ruled out.
  
Wait – let’s list actual _ _ A S E words that avoid the banned letters:
- GLASE – invalid (L is out)
- CLASE – invalid (C out, L out)
- CRASE – invalid (C out, R out)
- DRASE – invalid (R out)
- FRASE – invalid (R out)
- GRASE – invalid (R out)
- PRASE – invalid (R out)
- TRASE – invalid (R out)
- SLASE – invalid (S is already placed, and double S is not needed)
- SNASE – invalid (N is ok but word doesn’t exist)
- GNASE – invalid (word doesn’t exist)
- KNASE – invalid (word doesn’t exist)
- MNASE – invalid (word doesn’t exist)

The only valid _ _ A S E words remaining are those that use a consonant pair not yet eliminated. Checking a Scrabble word list, real _ _ A S E words include:
- PHASE – but H is out
- GLASE – L is out
- GRASE – R is out
- CRASE – C and R out
- DRASE – R out
- BRASE – B and R out
- TRASE – R out
- FRASE – R out
- PRASE – R out
- SLASE – S is already used in position 4, but the word exists (though it’s obscure)

The only common one left is “PHASE” but H is eliminated. “SLASE” exists but uses S twice and is obscure. The next likely candidate is “DRAPE” but that doesn’t match the ending.

Wait – re-examine our list carefully: the only remaining plausible _ _ A S E word that uses allowed letters is “PHASE”, but H is banned. Next possibility is “FLASE” (invalid). After that, “GLASE” (L banned), “GRASE” (R banned).

Actually, there isn’t a common word matching _ _ A S E that avoids B, L, R, I, C, H. So we need to allow a vowel in the first or second position. Let’s consider:

- “FEASE” – but FEASE is not a valid English word.
- “GEASE” – not valid
- “MEASE” – not valid
- “NEASE” – not valid
- “PEASE” – archaic form of “peas”, but valid
- “TEASE” – valid
- “WEASE” – not valid
- “SEASE” – not valid
- “LEASE” – valid but L is banned
- “PEASE” – valid, uses P and A (A already placed), but P is allowed, E is allowed.

Between “PEASE” and “TEASE”, “TEASE” introduces T and E (E already known), while “PEASE” introduces P. Both are valid 5-letter words.

“TEASE” is a common word that fits _ _ A S E (T and E are allowed), so let’s pick it.

But wait – we already have E in position 5, so the word must be T _ A S E. “TEASE” is T E A S E. That is valid, and E is allowed in position 2 even though we know the final E is position 5. The feedback will show whether the E in position 2 is correct or not (but we know E is in the word only in position 5 from earlier feedback). However, the rules allow us to guess valid words regardless.

So “TEASE” is acceptable.

But let’s check if any other _ _ A S E word is better. Another actual word is “DEMSE” but that doesn’t fit. After exhaustive check, “TEASE” is the only common word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the guess is “TEASE”.
