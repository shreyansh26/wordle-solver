For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word should contain several of these letters.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down future possibilities based on the feedback we receive.

From the feedback:

- A (position 1) → not in word (x)
- R (position 2) → not in word (x)
- O (position 3) → in word but wrong position (-)
- S (position 4) → not in word (x)
- E (position 5) → not in word (x)

So the only confirmed letter is O, and it is NOT in position 3.

To make the next guess, I should:
1. Include the letter O (since it is known to be in the word).
2. Avoid A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Avoid position 3 for O.
4. Use other common letters that have not been eliminated.

Good next letters: O, T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.  
A strong choice is a word that places O in a different position and uses common consonants.  
""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T — all still possible letters, and places O in position 2.

Another example: ""CLOUD"" — C, L, O, U, D. This uses O in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So ""CLOUD"" is bad.  
""DOING"" — D, O, I, N, G. Places O in position 2. This is also good.

Between ""POINT"" and ""DOING"", I prefer ""POINT"" because P and T are highly common consonants.

4. Use fresh common letters to probe:

Next word should:

- include O, I, N (but respect the forbidden positions)
- avoid the eliminated letters
- test a couple new consonants.

A word that satisfies this: “UNITY”
- T in position 5 ✓
- O is not used (we already know it’s in; we can test that later)
- I and N appear in new positions
- U and Y are fresh probes.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word should contain several of these letters.\n\nLooking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help narrow down future possibilities based on the feedback we receive.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n\n- A (position 1) → not in word (x)\n- R (position 2) → not in word (x)\n- O (position 3) → in word but wrong position (-)\n- S (position 4) → not in word (x)\n- E (position 5) → not in word (x)\n\nSo the only confirmed letter is O, and it is NOT in position 3.\n\nTo make the next guess, I should:\n1.

From the new feedback on DOING:

- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (now we know it also wasn’t in 3).
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (earlier we knew it wasn’t in 4).
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (earlier we knew it wasn’t in 5).
- G(-) – G is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the known letters in the word are:
- T (must be in position 5)
- O (somewhere except positions 2 and 3)
- I (somewhere except positions 3 and 4)
- N (somewhere except positions 4 and 5)
- G (somewhere except position 5)

We also know the following letters are OUT: A, R, S, E, P, D.

We need a word that:
- Ends in T
- Uses O, I, N, G (each in a position not yet ruled out)
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter, remembering T is fixed at position 5:

Positions: 1  2  3  4 5
           _  _  _  _ T

O cannot be in 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1 or 4
I cannot be in 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1 or 2
N cannot be in 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2 or 3
G cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3 or 4

Let’s try to assign these letters to positions:

Option 1: O in 1
   1:O, 5:T
   Then I must go in 2 (cannot go in 1 since O is there, and cannot go in 3 or 4)
   2:I
   Now N cannot go in 4 or 5 → can go in 3
   3:N
   Then G must go in 4
   4:G

   This gives us the word: O I N G T → “OINGT” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Option 2: O in 4
   4:O, 5:T
   Then I must go in 1 or 2 (cannot go in 3 or 4)
   Let’s try I in 1
   1:I
   Then N can go in 2 or 3
   G can go in 2 or 3 (remaining position)
   So:
   - If N is in 2, then G is in 3 → I N G O T → “INGOT” – valid word.
   - If N is in 3, then G is in 2 → I G N O T – “IGNOT” – not a word.

So the only valid word fitting all constraints so far is “INGOT”.

Let’s verify:
- I in 1 – allowed (was not forbidden for 1)
- N in 2 – allowed (was only forbidden for 4,5)
- G in 3 – allowed (only forbidden for 5)
- O in 4 – allowed (was forbidden for 2,3 – 4 is okay)
- T in 5 – required and correct
- No forbidden letters (A,R,S,E,P,D) are used

Let’s try to assign these letters to positions:

Option 1: O in 1
   1:O, 5:T
   Then I must go in 2 (cannot go in 1 since O is there, and cannot go in 3 or 4)
   2:I
   Now N cannot go in 4 or 5 → can go in 3
   3:N
   Then G must go in 4
   4:G

   This gives us the word: O I N G T → “OINGT” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Option 2: O in 4
   4:O, 5:T
   Then I must go in 1 or 2 (cannot go in 3 or 4)
   Let’s try I in 1
   1:I
   Then N can go in 2 or 3
   G can go in 2 or 3 (remaining position)
   So:
   - If N is in 2, then G is in 3 → I N G O T → “INGOT” – valid word.
   - If N is in 3, then G is in 2 → I G N O T – “IGNOT” – not a word.

So the only valid word fitting all constraints so far is “INGOT”.

Let’s verify:
- I in 1 – allowed (was not forbidden for 1)
- N in 2 – allowed (was only forbidden for 4,5)
- G in 3 – allowed (only forbidden for 5)
