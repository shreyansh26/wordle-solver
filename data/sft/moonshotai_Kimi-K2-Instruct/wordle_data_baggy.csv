For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has:
1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. A good mix of vowels and consonants

Some good starting words in Wordle are those with high-frequency letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because:
- It has the 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct
- It covers both common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)

But to maximize information, I think ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- C is a common consonant
- R, A, N, E are all very frequent letters
- It tests a good spread across the alphabet

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" gives the best coverage of common letters while maintaining good vowel-consonant balance.

   – A is in the word but not in spot 3  
   – P, L, N, T are NOT in the word  

Letters we now know the word does NOT contain:  
P, R, O, S, E, L, N, T

Letters we do know it contains:  
A (somewhere other than positions 1 or 3)

Common unused letters left:  
B C D F G H I J K M Q U V W X Y Z

Since we’ve eliminated so many consonants, let’s test letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, Y and make sure A ends up in spots 2, 4, or 5.

A good choice that:
- keeps A in a new position (say 2 or 4),
- introduces three to four new consonants,
- uses no eliminated letters,

would be “BADGY”.

However, let’s pick a word that feels more “common” while still meeting the constraints.  
“MADGY” or “CHALK” could work, but let’s double-check:

- CHALK: C, H, A, L, K  
  – L is already eliminated → skip

- MAGIC: M, A, G, I, C  
  – Uses C, G, I, M — all still possible  
  – Places A in position 2 (new position)

No conflicts with previous feedback.  
Let’s go with MAGIC.

From the new feedback we now know:

- M, I, C are NOT in the word.  

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ _

Letters already ruled out:  
P, R, O, S, E, L, N, T, M, I, C, plus A is locked in spot 2.

Still possible letters:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and G must appear once).

We need a common 5-letter word fitting:  
_ A _ _ _ and including G exactly once.

Plausible placement for G:  
- First position (G A _ _ _)  
- Fourth position (_ A _ G _)  
- Fifth position (_ A _ _ G)

Let’s try G in first position and pick remaining consonants that haven’t been used:  
GA _ _ _ : common endings might use B, D, H, K, etc.

A quick scan for common words gives “GAMER”, but M and E are already eliminated.

Next candidate: “GABBY” – but B repeats and we don’t know if repeats are allowed, plus we’d rather test new letters.

“GADID” – not common.

“GADGE” – has E (eliminated).

“GADID” already skipped.

“GASPY” – S is eliminated.

“GAUDY” – uses U, D, Y which are all still possible.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Common letters to maximize information gain
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. A good mix of vowels and consonants

Some good starting words in Wordle are those with high-frequency letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because:
- It has the 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct
- It covers both common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)

But to maximize information, I think ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- C is a common consonant
- R, A, N, E are all very frequent letters
- It tests a good spread across the alphabet

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" gives the best coverage of common letters while maintaining good vowel-consonant balance.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

A(-) – A is in the secret word but in a different position.
R(x) – R is NOT in the secret word.
O(x) – O is NOT in the secret word.
S(x) – S is NOT in the secret word.
E(x) – E is NOT in the secret word.

So we know:
- The word contains A (but not in position 1).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new word avoiding R, O, S, E entirely, and placing A somewhere other than the first position. We also want to keep testing common consonants and vowels. Common letters we haven’t tested yet include T, I, N, L, U, C, M, etc.

A good candidate would be:
- Using A in position 2, 3, 4, or 5
- Incorporating as many new common letters as possible (T, I, N, L...)

Possible first guesses: ""UNTIL"", ""MOUNT"", ""TULIP"", ""PLANT"", etc.

""PLANT"" is attractive because:
- Includes P, L, N, T (all new common consonants)
- Includes A in position 2 (not position 1)
- Avoids R, O, S, E

Let's break down the information we now have:

1. A is locked in position 2.
2. G must be in the word, but it's not in position 1 or 3 (from MAGIC feedback G is in word but not position 3, and GAUDY shows G is not in position 1).
3. Y is in the word and is in position 5 (from GAUDY feedback).
4. U and D are not in the word.

So the current pattern is: _ A _ _ Y with G somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. But A is already in position 2, so G must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, the letters we've ruled out are: P, R, O, S, E, L, N, T, M, I, C, U, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has G in position 3 or 4
- Has Y in position 5
- Uses only the available letters

Possible patterns:
- _ A G _ Y (G in position 3)
- _ A _ G Y (G in position 4)

Let's think of common words with these patterns:

For _ A G _ Y:
- BAGGY - but G repeats and we don't know if duplicates are allowed
- HAGGY - same issue with G
- SAGGY - S is eliminated

For _ A _ G Y:
- BAGGY - same issue
- FOGGY - O is eliminated
- BUGGY - U is eliminated
- BAGGY - already considered

Wait, let's think of other possibilities. Maybe:
- BARKY - but R and K are allowed? No, R is eliminated.
- MANGY - M is eliminated
- VAGUE - U and E are eliminated
- WACKY - C is eliminated
- BADLY - D and L are eliminated

Looking at the available letters (B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z), and considering our pattern _ A _ _ Y with G in position 3 or 4:

For _ A G _ Y:
We need a letter from available set for position 1 and 4. Position 4 would need to be from available letters, but none seem to make common words.

For _ A _ G Y:
Same issue - position 3 would need to be from available letters, but we're running low on options.

However, looking at the pattern _ A _ G Y with G in position 4, we have:
1st letter: from B, F, H, J, K, V, W
3rd letter: from B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- BANGY - but N is eliminated
- BAGGY - G repeats
- FANGY - N eliminated
- HANGY - N eliminated
- JANGY - N eliminated
- KANGY - N eliminated
- VANGY - N eliminated
- WANGY - N eliminated

This suggests we might need to consider that G could be in position 3 with a different structure.

Looking at _ A G _ Y:
1st letter: from B, F, H, J, K, V, W
4th letter: from B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible combinations:
- BAGFY - not a word
- BAGHY - not a word
- BAGKY - not a word
- FAGBY - not a word
- HAGBY - not a word
- VAGKY - not a word

Actually, let me reconsider. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word. The only remaining possibility seems to be with G in position 3 and a valid word would be:

BAGGY - but G repeats
HAGGY - G repeats
FAGGY - G repeats

This is problematic. Maybe I should consider that we might have missed that G could be in position 4 with a valid word.

Looking at _ A _ G Y:
The only common word I can think of is ""BAGGY"" but that has G in position 2-3 which conflicts with A in position 2.

Wait, let me think systematically:

We have the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
And we know G is in the word (positions 3 or 4)
And we have these letters available: B, F, H, J, K, V, W, X, Z (plus G must be used)

So:
- Position 1: B, F, H, J, K, V, W
- Position 3: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 4: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

And G must appear in either position 3 or 4.

Looking at valid words:
- BAGGY - G in 2-3, but A is in 2
- HAGGY - same
- FANGY - N eliminated
- KANGY - N eliminated

Actually, the only valid word that fits is ""BAGGY"" but G would be in position 3, making the word B A G G Y, but this has two G's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

However, the feedback from GAUDY showed Y in position 5 (✓), so the word ends with ...AY? No, it ends with ...Y. So the pattern is _ A _ _ Y.

Let me try to find a word with G in position 4:
_ A _ G Y

Possible:
- B A K G Y - not a word
- H A K G Y - not a word
- F A J G Y - not a word

The only common word I can think of is ""BAGGY"" but that has G in position 3.

Wait, let me think of ""BAHGY"" - no, not a word.

Given the constraints, I think the most likely word is ""BAGGY"" even with the double G, as it's a valid English word. The feedback didn't indicate no duplicates, so we should consider it.

But let me check another angle: the letters we have available are B, F, H, J, K, V, W, X, Z plus G and A (in position 2) and Y (in position 5).

So the pattern is: [B/F/H/J/K/V/W] A [G or valid letter] [G or valid letter] Y

Given G must appear, possible positions:
- Position 3: _ A G _ Y
- Position 4: _ A _ G Y

For position 3: _ A G _ Y
Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, V, W
Available letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- BAGBY - but B repeats
- BAGFY - not a word
- BAGHY - not a word
- BAGJY - not a word
- BAGKY - not a word
- BAGVY - not a word
- BAGWY - not a word

For position 4: _ A _ G Y
Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, V, W
Available letters for position 3: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- BAKGY - not a word
- BAVGY - not a word
- HAKGY - not a word
- VABGY - not a word

This is very restrictive. The only actual English word that fits seems to be ""BAGGY"" with the double G, even though G appears twice. Given no duplicate constraints were stated, this seems the most reasonable guess.

Given the constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2
- Y is fixed in position 5
- G must appear (but not in positions 1 or 3)
- Many letters have been eliminated
