For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains several common letters and can help me quickly identify potential letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

After considering options like SLATE, CRANE, and ADIEU, I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good coverage of frequent letters in English

I’ll choose “SINGH” (though H is less common, it’s a valid 5-letter word and tests N, G, H).
But let me think of a more common one: “SINUS” (but S is already in position 1, and we don’t know if S repeats).
Another option: “SINKS” (but again S repeats).
Better: “SLING” – uses L, N, G.
But let me pick “SLINK” – nice and common, uses L, N, K.

Wait, let me double-check:
SLINK: S(✓), L(new), I(✓), N(new), K(new). All letters are allowed. Good.

So SLINK is the next guess.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters in the word and their positions so far:
- Position 1: S  (✓)
- Position 3: I  (✓)

Letters that are in the word but NOT yet fixed:
- N  (from SLINK feedback: N(-) … so N is in the word but not in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, E, T, O, C, L, K

Therefore the secret word looks like:
S _ I _ _

and it contains an N that must appear in either position 2 or position 5 (it cannot be 1,3,4).

Remaining unused common letters that are still possible:
D, G, H, M, P, B, F, W, Y, V, U, J, Q, X, Z, etc.

Let’s list all 5-letter words of the form S _ I _ _ that contain N in position 2 or 5 and use only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible pattern candidates:
- S N I _ _   (N in position 2)
- S _ I _ N   (N in position 5)

For SN I _ _ we have positions 4 and 5 left; allowed letters: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, W, Y, V, U, etc.

A quick scan yields common English words:
- SNIDE  (but E is forbidden)
- SNIPE  (E forbidden)
- SNIPS  (S already used once, but could repeat; P is allowed)
- SNICK  (C and K forbidden)
- SNIFF  (F allowed)
- SING _ but G is okay, yet we already know position 4 can’t be G if N is in 2.

For S _ I _ N we have position 2 and 4 left; possible:
- S P I D N  (not a word)
- S M I L N  (not a word)
- S M I D N  (not a word)
- S W I N D  (D okay, but N is fixed at 5, so word would be S _ I _ N → SWIND not valid)
- S P I K N  (K forbidden)
- S M I R N  (R forbidden)

Actually a valid common word that fits is “S P I N D” – but that’s not a real word.

Wait, an actual dictionary word that matches is “S P I N D” no but “S H I N” no.

Real valid five-letter words:
- S N I P S (S already in position 1, but S can repeat; letters P and S allowed)
- S N I P S (valid word)

Another is “S N I D E” (E forbidden).

Another: “S N I F F” (F allowed).

Another: “S N I P S”.

Let me pick “SNIPS” – it is a valid English word, uses N in position 2, keeps S I, and introduces P and S (S repeat is allowed).

Check letters used: S, N, I, P, S – all letters are allowed (A,R,E,T,O,C,L,K forbidden – none present). So SNIPS is a valid candidate.

I will go with SNIPS as the next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains several common letters and can help me quickly identify potential letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

After considering options like SLATE, CRANE, and ADIEU, I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good coverage of frequent letters in English

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess ARISE we have:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (x) – R is not in the word at all.
- I (✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S (-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has an I in position 3.
- The word contains S somewhere except position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- We still have 5 positions to fill: _ _ I _ _

Good remaining consonants to try: N, T, L, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, W, Y, V
Good remaining vowels to try: O, U (since A, E, I are already handled)

I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps I in position 3
2. Uses S in a new position (not 4)
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels
4. Avoids A, R, E

I’ll choose “STOIC”:
- S in position 1 (new position for S)
- T – common consonant
- O – common vowel
- I stays in position 3
- C – common consonant

This tests S in position 1, plus T, O, C as new letters.

<guess>STOIC</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(x) I(-) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - Position 3 is I.
   - S is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).

2. STOIC → S(✓) T(x) O(x) I(-) C(x)
   - Position 1 is S.
   - I is somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5) – but we already know from ARISE that position 3 is I, so this is consistent.
   - T, O, C are not in the word.

Combining these two pieces of feedback:
- Known so far: S _ I _ _
- Known letters not in the word: A, R, E, T, O, C
- Still need three more letters from the remaining pool.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): N, L, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, W, Y, V, U, (I already used once, but we know I is in position 3), S (position 1), etc.

We have:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Positions 2, 4, 5: need to fill with letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps S in position 1 and I in position 3.
2. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels.
3. Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, E, T, O, C).

Good candidates: S _ I _ _

Possible letters for position 2: N, L, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, W, Y, V, U
Possible letters for position 4: same
Possible letters for position 5: same

I’ll choose “SINGH” (though H is less common, it’s a valid 5-letter word and tests N, G, H).

Let's update what we know after four guesses.

Known positions:
- Position 1 = S (✓)
- Position 2 = N (✓)   (from SNIPS feedback)
- Position 3 = I (✓)

Known letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, E, T, O, C, L, K, P

So the word looks like:
S N I _ _

Only position 4 and 5 remain.

From SNIPS feedback: the second S got ""S(-)"", meaning S is in the word but not in position 5 – which is already satisfied because we have S in position 1. This reinforces that S does NOT appear again in position 5.

Therefore position 5 must be a new letter, and position 4 also must be a new letter.

Available letters (not yet tested and not on the forbidden list):
D, G, H, M, B, F, W, Y, V, U, J, Q, X, Z

We need two distinct letters from that set to fill positions 4 and 5, and the resulting five-letter English word must start with SNI.

Common dictionary words starting with SNI:
- SNIDE  (but E is forbidden)
- SNIFF  (F allowed, second F allowed)
- SNIGS  (G allowed, S not allowed again in 5)
- SNIPS  (already tried)
- SNITS  (T forbidden)
- SNIBS  (B allowed, second S not allowed in 5)

Among these, ""SNIFF"" is a valid English word, uses only allowed letters (F is not forbidden), and fits the pattern S N I _ _. Let's check: S, N, I, F, F – none of A, R, E, T, O, C, L, K, P appear. Perfect.

Therefore the next guess is SNIFF.
