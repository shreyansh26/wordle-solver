For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us maximum information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Good starting words typically include vowels and common consonants.

Some excellent starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" - uses all common vowels and common consonants
- ""ADIEU"" - heavy on vowels
- ""SLATE"" - includes common letters
- ""CRANE"" - good consonant spread
- ""AUDIO"" - all vowels plus common consonant

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a very popular starting word that covers 4 vowels (including Y as a sometimes vowel) and common consonants, giving us good information about what letters might be in the secret word.

The feedback shows that **none** of the letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) appear in the secret word at all. So we can eliminate all these letters entirely. Since we need a completely fresh set of letters, I’ll choose a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E and instead uses other common consonants and vowels. A good next step is to test a word with entirely different letters. 

Common letters not yet tested include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y. 
A word like ""UNITY"" or ""CHIMP"" could work, but I’ll pick a word that balances vowels and consonants. ""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L—all common and untested letters.

We now have:

Known letters and positions:
- T is correct in position 4.
- I is correct in position 2.
- H is correct in position 5.

Known letters not yet placed:
- D is in the word but not in position 3.

Letters to avoid so far:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, W

Thus the word looks like: _ I _ T H and must contain D somewhere other than position 3.

The only unfilled spots are positions 1 and 3.  
D cannot sit in position 3, so D must sit in position 1.

That fixes position 1 as D.

Therefore the word must be: D I _ T H, and the only common letter left for position 3 that hasn’t been ruled out is “M”.

Checking “DIMTH” – not a valid English word.  
Wait, we need to list 5-letter English words matching D I _ T H.

Actually, position 3 must be a letter we haven’t ruled out. Available consonants we haven’t tried yet: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y.

Common words ending in “ITH” include “BIRTH”, “MIRTH”, “GIRTH”, “FILTH”, “FIFTH”, etc. But we have: D I _ T H.

Looking again: we have D I _ T H.

Wait, the word must be D I _ T H, with the blank in position 3. The only common word that fits is “DICTH”? No, that’s not a word. “DITCH” is a valid word, but we haven’t eliminated “C” or any other letter yet.

But let’s check: D I T C H – no, T is already fixed in 4th.  
Wait, the structure is: _ I _ T H, with 5 letters. So positions 1-5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We have:

- Position 1: D (since D must be in the word and can’t be in 3, and 2,4,5 are fixed)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: H

Thus the word must be: D I ? T H. We need a 5-letter word spelled D I _ T H.

The only valid English word matching this is “DITCH”.

Let’s verify:
- D: not yet ruled out
- I: correct in position 2
- T: correct in position 4
- C: not yet ruled out
- H: correct in position 5

All constraints satisfied.
