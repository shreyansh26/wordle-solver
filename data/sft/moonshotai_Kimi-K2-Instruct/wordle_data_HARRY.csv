For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about what's in the secret word. A common strategy is to use words with frequent vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word.

Some good first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" because it uses the very common letters S, T, A, R, and E, which should give me good information about what's in the word.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the correct position (✓) — so R is the 4th letter
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ R _
- Contains the letter A somewhere not in position 3
- Does NOT contain S, T, E

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps R in the 4th spot
- Includes A in a different position
- Uses new common letters (avoiding S, T, E)

Possible continuations: BARON, CARRY, MARRY, CHARD, HARDY, DRAFT, etc.

I’ll go with ""CHARD"" because it keeps R in spot 4, moves A to spot 2, and introduces C, H, D — all common letters we haven’t tested yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A common strategy is to use words with frequent vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word.

Some good first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" because it uses the very common letters S, T, A, R, and E, which should give me good information about what's in the word.

Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the correct position (✓) — so R is the 4th letter
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ R _
- Contains the letter A somewhere not in position 3
- Does NOT contain S, T, E

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps R in the 4th spot
- Includes A in a different position
- Uses new common letters (avoiding S, T, E)

Possible continuations: BARON, CARRY, MARRY, CHARD, HARDY, DRAFT, etc.

I’ll go with ""CHARD"" because it keeps R in spot 4, moves A to spot 2, and introduces C, H, D — all common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CHARD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) A(-) R(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on CHARD:
- C is not in the word (x)
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is still in the word but still not in the correct position (-)
- R is still correct in the 4th spot (✓)
- D is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ R _
- Contains the letters A and H (with neither in their current positions)
  - A cannot be in position 3
  - H cannot be in position 2
- Excludes: S, T, E, C, D

Next, I need a word that:
- Keeps R in position 4
- Uses both A and H in new positions
- Avoids all excluded letters (S, T, E, C, D)

Good candidate structure: _ A _ R _ or _ _ A R _ or _ _ _ R A (but A can't be in position 3 from STARE feedback)

Considering possible words:
- FARMY (but M and Y haven't been tested, and F is okay)
- MARRY (but we know A can't be in position 3)
- HARPY (but H would be in position 1, which wasn't tested yet)
- HARDY (but D is excluded)

HARPY would place:
- H in position 1 (new position, not position 2)
- A in position 2 (new position, not position 3)
- R in position 4 (correct)
- P and Y are new letters

This seems like a good test that covers all requirements.

Alternative: MARSH (but S is excluded)
Alternative: FARMY (but Y is less common)
HARPY seems best as it maximizes letter coverage while respecting constraints.

Possible consonants (and vowels) still allowed for position 3:

The only remaining possibility that is actually in an English dictionary is H A L R Y (a variant spelling or slang of “Harry”). However, “HALRY” is not recognized as a standard word.  

Rechecking standard dictionaries, the only valid 5-letter word matching H A _ R Y is indeed H A R R Y (double R), but we already have R in position 4 and cannot have another R without conflicting with single-letter feedback constraints.

Realizing I missed a simple possibility: H A L R Y isn’t valid, but H A N R Y also isn’t. In fact, the only common valid word in English that fits H A _ R Y is H A R R Y, but it would have two R’s, and we already know R is in position 4 exactly once. Therefore, the only plausible valid word left is:

H A L R Y – invalid
H A N R Y – invalid

Wait—let me reconsider the English lexicon more carefully. The valid word is H A L R Y? No, that’s not recognized. The correct word is H A R R Y, but it doesn’t fit because it has two R’s.

Ah, the mistake is in my earlier assumption. Let me list all valid English 5-letter words fitting H A _ R Y and excluding I:

- HARRY (two R’s) – technically valid but conflicts with single R placement.
- HAMRY – invalid
- HABRY – invalid

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits is HARRY, despite the double R. We must accept that the word has two R’s and the feedback still holds because the single R in position 4 is correct. Therefore:

H A R R Y

So, the word is HARRY.
