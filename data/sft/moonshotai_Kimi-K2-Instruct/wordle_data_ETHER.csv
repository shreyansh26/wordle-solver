For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants. A good starting word has a mix of common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

One of the most popular and effective first guesses is ""SLATE"" because:
- S is a very common starting letter in English words
- L is a common consonant
- A is the most common vowel
- T is very common in English
- E is the most common letter overall

Other good options include ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" strikes a good balance between common letters and positional value.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A are not in the word at all (x).
- T and E are in the word but not in the 4th or 5th positions, respectively (-).

So the secret word:
- does NOT contain S, L, or A.

Let's break down the two rounds of feedback.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   Letters that are confirmed NOT in the word: S, L, A.
   Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: T, E.

2. TREND → T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   Letters confirmed NOT in the word: N, D (and we already knew S, L, A).
   Letters that ARE in the word but still in wrong positions: T and E again.

Summary so far:
- Must contain: T and E (positions not yet known).
- Must not contain: S, L, A, N, D.

Since T and E have now appeared in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively in the two guesses and are still marked (-), we know:
- T is not in positions 1 or 4.
- E is not in positions 3 or 5.

That leaves:
- T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4 or 1).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3 or 5).

Looking for common 5-letter words that use T and E, and avoid S, L, A, N, D.

Good consonants still available: R, C, H, B, M, F, G, etc.
Vowels available: E (already used), I, O, U (A is out).

A logical next guess should test new common consonants and place T/E in fresh spots. ""CHUTE"" uses:
- C, H, U (new letters)
- places T in position 4 (allowed because previous T was (-) in position 4 only once; since SLATE had T(-) in position 4, T can't be in 4. So CHUTE is invalid.)

Another option: ""PETER"" – but T in position 3 (T was in 1 and 3 both marked (-), so 3 could be possible; but E would be in 2 and 5, and 5 is already forbidden for E). So PETER is invalid.

Next try: ""METER"" – E in 2 and 5 (5 is invalid), so no.

Next try: ""ETHER"" – E in 1 and 5 (5 invalid), so no.

Next try: ""ROUTE"" – O, U, R, T, E:
- T in 4 (invalid, from SLATE)
- E in 5 (invalid, from SLATE)

Next try: ""BUTEO"" (a type of hawk) – but this might be obscure.

Next try: ""CUTIE"" – uses C, U, T, I, E:
- T in 3 (allowed, no restriction yet on 3)
- E in 5 (invalid from SLATE feedback)
So CUTIE is invalid.

Next try: ""HUTER"" – uses H, U, T, E, R:
- T in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- All letters not yet ruled out.

But ""HUTER"" is not a common English word. A better common word is ""THEIR"":
- T in 1 (invalid from TREND)
So no.

Next try: ""OTHER"" – O, T, H, E, R:
- T in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- All letters not yet ruled out (O, T, H, E, R; none are S, L, A, N, D)
- This is a common English word.

So I’ll guess OTHER.

- C, H, U (new letters)
- places T in position 4 (allowed because previous T was (-) in position 4 only once; since SLATE had T(-) in position 4, T can't be in 4. So CHUTE is invalid.)

Another option: ""PETER"" – but T in position 3 (T was in 1 and 3 both marked (-), so 3 could be possible; but E would be in 2 and 5, and 5 is already forbidden for E). So PETER is invalid.

Next try: ""METER"" – E in 2 and 5 (5 is invalid), so no.

Next try: ""ETHER"" – E in 1 and 5 (5 invalid), so no.

Next try: ""ROUTE"" – O, U, R, T, E:
- T in 4 (invalid, from SLATE)
- E in 5 (invalid, from SLATE)

Next try: ""BUTEO"" (a type of hawk) – but this might be obscure.

Next try: ""CUTIE"" – uses C, U, T, I, E:
- T in 3 (allowed, no restriction yet on 3)
- E in 5 (invalid from SLATE feedback)
So CUTIE is invalid.

Next try: ""HUTER"" – uses H, U, T, E, R:
- T in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- All letters not yet ruled out.

But ""HUTER"" is not a common English word. A better common word is ""THEIR"":
- T in 1 (invalid from TREND)
So no.

Next try: ""OTHER"" – O, T, H, E, R:
- T in 2 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- All letters not yet ruled out (O, T, H, E, R; none are S, L, A, N, D)
- This is a common English word.

So I’ll guess OTHER.

Now the picture is much clearer.

From the feedback on OTHER:
- O is **not** in the word (x).
- T is in the **second position** (✓).
- H is in the **third position** (✓).
- E is in the **fourth position** (✓).
- R is in the **fifth position** (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ T H E R

Only the first letter is missing.

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, N, D, O.

Possible remaining consonants for the first position: B, C, F, G, M, P, V, W, etc.

Quick scan of 5-letter English words ending in “THER”:

- B + THER → **BTHER** (invalid)
- C + THER → **CTHER** (invalid)
- F + THER → **FTHER** (but the word is “FATHER” which has an A, already ruled out)
- G + THER → **GTHER** (invalid)
- M + THER → **MTHER** (invalid)
- P + THER → **PTHER** (invalid)
- V + THER → **VTHER** (invalid)
- W + THER → **WTHER** (invalid)

The only standard English word that fits “_THER” with no ruled-out letters is **ETHER** … but “E” is already in the fourth slot and can’t repeat in the first slot.

Wait—let’s list actual 5-letter words that end in “THER”:

- **OTHER** (O is ruled out)
- **ETHER** (E is already in slot 4, so duplicate E is allowed, but the first E would clash with our fixed E in slot 4 if we’re strict about unique positions—actually, letters can repeat unless Wordle says otherwise; however, Ether would be E T H E R, which duplicates E in slot 1 and 4—possible, but need to check).

Rechecking our feedback: There’s no restriction against repeated letters, and “ETHER” is a valid guess. But we already guessed OTHER and got full confirmation on T, H, E, R positions. So the only remaining option is a word starting with a valid consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Running through consonants:
- B → BTHER (invalid)
- C → CTHER (invalid)
- F → FTHER (invalid, but “FATHER” invalid due to A)
- P → PTHER (invalid)
- V → VTHER (invalid)
- W → WTHER (invalid)

Looks like there’s only one standard 5-letter word that ends in “THER” without any ruled-out letters: **ETHER** (E T H E R). The duplicate E is the only possibility left.

Hence, the word must be ETHER.
