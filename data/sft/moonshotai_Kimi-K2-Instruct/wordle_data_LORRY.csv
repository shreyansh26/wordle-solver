Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I need to choose a strong starting word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information. A good first word should include frequently used letters in English words, especially vowels and common consonants. 

Words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU are popular choices, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (second most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). The only place L could be is position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- A, T, E are all not in the word (x).

So the secret word contains the letter L, but not in position 2. It does not contain S, A, T, or E.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses L in a different position (not position 2).
2. Uses other common letters (especially vowels) that haven't been eliminated yet.

Vowels still available: I, O, U  
Common consonants still available: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A good word to try is ""FLING"":
- F is common and not yet tested.
- L is used in position 2 (but since original L was in position 2 and marked wrong, this is now allowed because the feedback only said L is in the word but wrong position, not that it can't be in position 2 again. However, this might be risky. Let me rethink.)

Actually, the feedback says L is in the word but wrong position. Since the original L was in position 2, position 2 is now a ""wrong position"" for L, so L can be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Let me choose ""WORLD"":
- W is new.
- O is a new vowel.
- R is common.
- L is in position 3 (different from original position 2).
- D is common.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters and reposition L.

Let’s update what we now know after two guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, W, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), R (position 3), L (somewhere, but not in position 4 – because in WORLD the L was in position 4 and marked “-”).

So far we have:
- Position 2 = O ✓
- Position 3 = R ✓
- L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out for L, and 3 is already R).

Also, remaining unused common letters include I, U, N, M, G, C, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has R in position 3.
- Has L somewhere else (positions 1 or 5, since position 3 is R).
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible pattern: _ O R _ _  or _ O _ R _  (but position 3 is already fixed as R), so the pattern must be _ O R _ _.  
The only place left for L is position 1 or 5.

Let’s try L O R _ _.  If we put L in position 1, we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Common endings after “LOR”:
- “D” is out (already ruled out)
- “N” or “M” or “G” or “Y”, etc.

“LORGN” isn’t a word; “LORIN” is a proper noun but not common. “LORUM” isn’t valid.  
“LORRY” is valid.

Check: L O R R Y
- L (position 1) – possible.  
- O (position 2) – matches ✓  
- R (position 3) – matches ✓  
- R (position 4) – acceptable; we have no info against another R.  
- Y – unused yet.

So “LORRY” fits all constraints.

Alternative check:
Another valid word pattern is _ O R _ L, e.g., “FORML” is invalid, “GORAL” is obscure, “CORAL” is valid but doesn’t use L in position 5 (it uses L in position 4 which is excluded).  
So “LORRY” seems best.
