For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular first guesses in Wordle include words like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters appear in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can safely rule out any word containing S, L, A, T, or E.

So far every letter we have tried is either “x” (not present) or “-” (present but in the wrong spot).

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses I (so we can pin down its correct position).
2. Introduces as many new, common letters as possible.

Candidate words that fit:
- DOING

Among these, “DOING” contains four fresh common letters (D, O, N, G) plus the known letter I.

Current state from all feedback:

- Letters completely ruled out (x in every appearance):
  S,L,A,T,E,C,R,M,P,O,N,G

- Letters confirmed present (but positions still unknown):
  I  (seen as “-” in CRIMP and DOING)
  D  (seen as “✓” in first position from DOING)

So far the pattern is:
D _ _ _ _

The only letters we still have not tried that are common in 5-letter words are: B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y, and the already-known I.

We also know that I is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (because it appeared “-” there in CRIMP and DOING respectively). Therefore I must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with D
2. Contains I (in position 2 or 5)
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out: D, I, B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y

- DINKY is a valid word, but uses N which is ruled out.
- DIVVY is a valid word, but uses V twice and Y which are both allowed.
- DITTY is invalid (uses T which is ruled out).
- DUMMY is invalid (uses M and U, but M is ruled out).
- DUVVY is invalid (uses U and V, but not a word).
- DITZY is invalid (uses T and Z, T is ruled out).
- DHIBU is not valid.
- DHIVY is not valid.
- DINKY is invalid (N is ruled out).
- DIBBY is invalid (B twice, but not a word).
- DIDDY is invalid (D twice, but uses D already and D is confirmed).
- DITZY is invalid (T is ruled out).

Wait, let me think of real words that start with D and have I in position 2 or 5:
- DRIVE: I in position 3 – no (position 3 is invalid for I)
- DIVID: invalid (D at end but uses D twice)
- DIXIE: X is not yet tried, but I is in position 4 – no (position 4 is invalid)
- DINKY: N is ruled out
- DURVY: not a word
- DUVVY: not a word
- DHIBU: not a word
- DIKEY: not a word
- DIBBY: not a word
- DIBUK: K is allowed, but U is allowed and K is allowed – DIBUK is a variant spelling of DYBBUK, but is it in the Wordle dictionary? Probably not.

- DIKED: E is ruled out
- DIMLY: M is ruled out
- DINGY: N and G are ruled out
- DINKY: N is ruled out
- DIRTY: R and T are ruled out
- DISHY: S and H are ruled out
- DITZY: T is ruled out
- DIVAN: A is ruled out
- DIVVY: V and Y are allowed – this is a word (means to divide up)
- DIVOT: T is ruled out
- DIXIE: X is allowed, but I is in position 4 which is invalid
- DIZZY: Z and Z – Z is not ruled out, but this seems less common

Among these, DIVVY seems the most plausible real word that fits the constraints:
- Starts with D
- Uses I in position 2 (which is allowed)
- Uses only letters not ruled out: D, I, V, Y (V and Y are new, D and I are confirmed)

- Letters completely ruled out (x in every appearance):

- Letters confirmed present (but positions still unknown):
  I  (seen as “-” in CRIMP and DOING)
  D  (seen as “✓” in first position from DOING)

So far the pattern is:
D _ _ _ _

The only letters we still have not tried that are common in 5-letter words are: B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y, and the already-known I.

We also know that I is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (because it appeared “-” there in CRIMP and DOING respectively). Therefore I must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with D
2. Contains I (in position 2 or 5)
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out: D, I, B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular first guesses in Wordle include words like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters appear in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can safely rule out any word containing S, L, A, T, or E.  
For the next guess, I should pick entirely new, common letters.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, P, M  
Good vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced 5-letter word that uses five distinct, common letters none of which are S/L/A/T/E is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P).  
It avoids the eliminated letters and gives us a fresh set to test.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far every letter we have tried is either “x” (not present) or “-” (present but in the wrong spot).

Letters already ruled out:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  

Known:
- I appears somewhere in the word (but not in the 4th position, where it was placed in CRIMP).

Remaining common vowels: O, U  
Remaining common consonants: N, D, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses I (so we can pin down its correct position).
2. Introduces as many new, common letters as possible.

Candidate words that fit:
- DOING
- HOUND
- UNION
- JOINT
- VINYL
- WIDOW
- …

Among these, “DOING” contains four fresh common letters (D, O, N, G) plus the known letter I.  
It places I in the 3rd position, which is different from the 4th position in CRIMP, giving us new positional info.

Therefore I’ll guess DOING.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Pattern: D I _ _ Y  (positions 1, 2 and 5 are locked in)
2. Letters ruled out (from all previous feedback):  
   S L A T E C R M P O N G V  
3. Letters still legal for positions 3 and 4 (must NOT be any of the ruled-out letters):  
   B, F, H, J, K, U, W, (and D, I, Y are already used)

We need two distinct letters from the legal set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Common remaining digraphs:
- B & F → D I B F Y (not a word)  
- B & K → D I B K Y (not a word)  
- F & K → D I F K Y (not a word)

- B & W → D I B W Y (not a word)  
- H & W → D I H W Y (not a word)  
- F & W → D I F W Y (not a word)

Look for actual English words that fit D I _ _ Y.

Real words fitting:
- DIKEY (rare variant spelling of “dykey”) – probably not in Wordle list  
- DINKY – N already ruled out  
- DICED – C already ruled out  
- DILLY – L already ruled out  
- DIMLY – M already ruled out  
- DINGY – N, G already ruled out  
- DIRTY – R, T already ruled out  
- DISHY – S, H already ruled out  
- DITZY – T, Z ruled out  
- DIWAN – A already ruled out  
- DIXIE – X not yet ruled out, but position 4 is where X would go in DIXIE, and I is already fixed in position 2.

Wait: DIXIE has I in position 2, X in position 3, I in position 4 – but we already have I in position 2, and we can’t have another I. So that’s invalid.

Let me think again carefully: we need a 5-letter word D I _ _ Y with legal letters.  
Going through a mental list, the only remotely common word is DIKEY (slang), but it’s not in the standard Wordle dictionary.

I’m left with only one plausible, valid word: DITTY.  
But T is ruled out, so that’s invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the ruled-out list to be certain I haven’t missed any letters.

Ruled-out letters from all guesses:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P, O, N, G, V  
That leaves: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, U, W, Y

Letters already used in the pattern: D, I, Y

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled by two distinct letters from {B, F, H, J, K, U, W}.

Are there any real 5-letter words D I _ _ Y using only these letters?

- D I B B Y – B twice, but B is allowed; but DIBBY isn’t a word.
- D I B U Y – not a word.
- D I F F Y – F twice; DIFFY isn’t a word.
- D I F K Y – not a word.
- D I H K Y – not a word.
- D I K U Y – not a word.
- D I W B Y – not a word.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits the pattern and the letter constraints is DIKEY (though it’s uncommon). There’s no other possibility remaining.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

DIKEY

- DINKY – N already ruled out  
- DICED – C already ruled out  
- DILLY – L already ruled out  
- DIMLY – M already ruled out  
- DINGY – N, G already ruled out  
- DIRTY – R, T already ruled out  
- DISHY – S, H already ruled out  
- DITZY – T, Z ruled out  
- DIWAN – A already ruled out  
- DIXIE – X not yet ruled out, but position 4 is where X would go in DIXIE, and I is already fixed in position 2.

Wait: DIXIE has I in position 2, X in position 3, I in position 4 – but we already have I in position 2, and we can’t have another I. So that’s invalid.

Let me think again carefully: we need a 5-letter word D I _ _ Y with legal letters.  
Going through a mental list, the only remotely common word is DIKEY (slang), but it’s not in the standard Wordle dictionary.

I’m left with only one plausible, valid word: DITTY.  
But T is ruled out, so that’s invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine the ruled-out list to be certain I haven’t missed any letters.

Ruled-out letters from all guesses:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P, O, N, G, V  
That leaves: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, U, W, Y

Letters already used in the pattern: D, I, Y

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled by two distinct letters from {B, F, H, J, K, U, W}.

Are there any real 5-letter words D I _ _ Y using only these letters?

- D I B B Y – B twice, but B is allowed; but DIBBY isn’t a word.
- D I B U Y – not a word.
- D I F F Y – F twice; DIFFY isn’t a word.
- D I F K Y – not a word.
- D I H K Y – not a word.
- D I K U Y – not a word.
- D I W B Y – not a word.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits the pattern and the letter constraints is DIKEY (though it’s uncommon). There’s no other possibility remaining.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,dizzy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently occurring vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular first guesses in Wordle include words like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters appear in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can safely rule out any word containing S, L, A, T, or E.  
For the next guess, I should pick entirely new, common letters.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, D, P, M  
Good vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced 5-letter word that uses five distinct, common letters none of which are S/L/A/T/E is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P).  
It avoids the eliminated letters and gives us a fresh set to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far every letter we have tried is either “x” (not present) or “-” (present but in the wrong spot).

Letters already ruled out:
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P  

Known:
- I appears somewhere in the word (but not in the 4th position, where it was placed in CRIMP).

Remaining common vowels: O, U  
Remaining common consonants: N, D, G, H, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses I (so we can pin down its correct position).
2. Introduces as many new, common letters as possible.

Candidate words that fit:
- DOING
- HOUND
- UNION
- JOINT
- VINYL
- WIDOW
- …

Among these, “DOING” contains four fresh common letters (D, O, N, G) plus the known letter I.  
It places I in the 3rd position, which is different from the 4th position in CRIMP, giving us new positional info.

Therefore I’ll guess DOING.

Guess 2: CRIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(-) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state from all feedback:

- Letters completely ruled out (x in every appearance):
  S,L,A,T,E,C,R,M,P,O,N,G

- Letters confirmed present (but positions still unknown):
  I  (seen as “-” in CRIMP and DOING)
  D  (seen as “✓” in first position from DOING)

So far the pattern is:
D _ _ _ _

The only letters we still have not tried that are common in 5-letter words are: B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y, and the already-known I.

We also know that I is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (because it appeared “-” there in CRIMP and DOING respectively). Therefore I must be in position 2 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with D
2. Contains I (in position 2 or 5)
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out: D, I, B, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y

Candidate words that fit:
- DHIKW (invalid, not a real word)
- DUVKY (invalid)
- DIWKY (invalid)
- DHIBU (invalid)
- DHIVY (invalid)
- DHIBF (invalid)
- DHIKY (invalid)

Let me think of real words:
- DHIBU is not a valid English word.
- DINKY is a valid word, but uses N which is ruled out.
- DIVVY is a valid word, but uses V twice and Y which are both allowed.
- DITTY is invalid (uses T which is ruled out).
- DUMMY is invalid (uses M and U, but M is ruled out).
- DUVVY is invalid (uses U and V, but not a word).
- DITZY is invalid (uses T and Z, T is ruled out).
- DHIBU is not valid.
- DHIVY is not valid.
- DINKY is invalid (N is ruled out).
- DIBBY is invalid (B twice, but not a word).
- DIDDY is invalid (D twice, but uses D already and D is confirmed).
- DITZY is invalid (T is ruled out).

Wait, let me think of real words that start with D and have I in position 2 or 5:
- DRIVE: I in position 3 – no (position 3 is invalid for I)
- DIVID: invalid (D at end but uses D twice)
- DIXIE: X is not yet tried, but I is in position 4 – no (position 4 is invalid)
- DINKY: N is ruled out
- DURVY: not a word
- DUVVY: not a word
- DHIBU: not a word
- DIKEY: not a word
- DIBBY: not a word
- DIBUK: K is allowed, but U is allowed and K is allowed – DIBUK is a variant spelling of DYBBUK, but is it in the Wordle dictionary? Probably not.
- DIBBS: S is ruled out
- DICKY: C is ruled out
- DIKEY: not a word
- DIWAN: W is allowed, A is ruled out
- DIKED: E is ruled out
- DIMLY: M is ruled out
- DINGY: N and G are ruled out
- DINKY: N is ruled out
- DIRTY: R and T are ruled out
- DISHY: S and H are ruled out
- DITZY: T is ruled out
- DIVAN: A is ruled out
- DIVVY: V and Y are allowed – this is a word (means to divide up)
- DIVOT: T is ruled out
- DIXIE: X is allowed, but I is in position 4 which is invalid
- DIZZY: Z and Z – Z is not ruled out, but this seems less common

Among these, DIVVY seems the most plausible real word that fits the constraints:
- Starts with D
- Uses I in position 2 (which is allowed)
- Uses only letters not ruled out: D, I, V, Y (V and Y are new, D and I are confirmed)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed facts:

1. Pattern: D I _ _ Y  (positions 1, 2 and 5 are locked in)
2. Letters ruled out (from all previous feedback):  
   S L A T E C R M P O N G V  
3. Letters still legal for positions 3 and 4 (must NOT be any of the ruled-out letters):  
   B, F, H, J, K, U, W, (and D, I, Y are already used)

We need two distinct letters from the legal set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Common remaining digraphs:
- B & F → D I B F Y (not a word)  
- B & K → D I B K Y (not a word)  
- F & K → D I F K Y (not a word)  
- H & K → D I H K Y (not a word)

- B & W → D I B W Y (not a word)  
- H & W → D I H W Y (not a word)  
- F & W → D I F W Y (not a word)

Look for actual English words that fit D I _ _ Y.

- DIWAN – A already ruled out  
- DIXIE – X not yet ruled out, but position 4 is where X would go in DIXIE, and I is already fixed in position 2.

Wait: DIXIE has I in position 2, X in position 3, I in position 4 – but we already have I in position 2, and we can’t have another I. So that’s invalid.

Letters already used in the pattern: D, I, Y

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled by two distinct letters from {B, F, H, J, K, U, W}.

- Letters still legal for positions 3 & 4 (must differ from one another):
  B, F, H, J, U, W   (D, I, Y are already used)

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form D I _ _ Y made only from {B, F, H, J, U, W}.

Checking the list:

- D I B B Y → not valid (DIBBY not a word)  
- D I B F Y → no  
- D I B H Y → no  
- D I B J Y → no  
- D I B U Y → no  
- D I B W Y → no  
- D I F F Y → DIFFY (slang, not in Wordle)  
- D I F H Y → no  
- D I F J Y → no  
- D I F U Y → no  
- D I F W Y → no  
- D I H H Y → no  
- D I H J Y → no

- D I W J Y → no  
- D I W U Y → no  
- D I W W Y → no  

The only remaining valid word in the Wordle dictionary that matches is DITTY, but T is already banned.  
Going back, the only standard word that fits the pattern is DIZZY (Z not yet banned).  

Therefore the only possible guess left is DIZZY.
