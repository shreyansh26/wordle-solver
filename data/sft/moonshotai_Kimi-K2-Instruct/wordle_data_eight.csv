For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels like A, E, I
- Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L
- No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Considering these factors, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E (testing all major vowels)
- 2 very common consonants: R, S
- All unique letters
- High frequency letters in English 5-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
2. DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position

Good next steps:
- Keep E but move it to positions 1-4
- Introduce new common consonants (especially ones not yet tested like T, N, L, D, C, etc.)
- Avoid letters already ruled out (A, R, O, S)

Possible candidates: 
- ""UNTIE"" (but has I and U which weren't tested, but N/T are good)
- ""ELITE"" (but has L/I/T - good mix)
- ""EVENT"" (but V is less common)
- ""TENET"" (but repeats E and has T twice)

The best choice seems ""UNTIE"" as it:
- Uses E in position 4 (new position)

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Letters we have tried so far  
A, R, O, S, U, N, C  → all x (not in the word)  
E, T, I, H            → feedback received

Exact feedback on ETHIC  
- E in position 1 → ✓ (correct)  
- T somewhere else → still in word but wrong spot  
- H somewhere else → still in word but wrong spot  
- I somewhere else → still in word but wrong spot  
- C → x (not in the word)

Hence the secret word is of the form  
E _ _ _ _  (first letter is E fixed)  

and it must contain, somewhere among positions 2-5, the letters T, I, H each exactly once (because each received “-”).

Letters still allowed to appear (have not been marked x yet):  
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-known T, I, H.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with E, containing T, I, H, and using two more distinct letters chosen only from the still-allowed set.  The letters T, I, H cannot be in their ETHIC positions (T≠2, I≠4, H≠3).

Good candidates:
- EIGHT  – letters E, I, G, H, T  
  – starts with E ✓  
  – contains I, G, H, T (all allowed)  
  – positions: I is now in 2 (allowed), G in 3 (new), H in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed)  
  – no ruled-out letters

Therefore EIGHT is a valid and informative next guess.
