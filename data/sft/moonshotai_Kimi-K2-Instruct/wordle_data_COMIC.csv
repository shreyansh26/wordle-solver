Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to guide my word choice. To maximize the information gained, I should choose a word that contains common letters in different positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Looking at common letters in 5-letter words, the letters S, T, R, E, A, O, I, N are very frequent. A word like ""STARE"" contains 5 very common letters (S, T, A, R, E) and will help identify which of these letters are in the secret word. ""STARE"" is also a valid English word.

Other good first guesses could be ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""STARE"" seems like a solid choice with good letter coverage.

All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I now know to avoid:

- S, T, A, R, E entirely  
- Any word that contains any of these letters.

I need a 5-letter word that does **not** contain S, T, A, R, or E.  
I also want a word with a good mix of other common letters to gain new information.  
Looking at remaining high-frequency letters:

- Common consonants left: N, L, O, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y  
- Common vowels left: I, O, U

A word that uses several of these and avoids the banned letters is “D O L P H” (DOLPH).  
It contains D, O, L, P, H — none of which appeared in the first guess.

Other options could be “CHIMP”, “BLOCK”, “FLUNK”, etc., but “DOLPH” is simple and covers a good spread of new letters.

From the feedback:

- STARE → all letters (S T A R E) are absent.
- DOLPH → only O is present and in the correct position.

So we now know:
1. The secret word is _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2).
2. Letters to avoid so far: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H.

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is O and that contains none of the disallowed letters. The remaining common consonants are N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, etc., and remaining vowels are I, U.

I want a word that uses fresh common letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to maximize information. A quick scan yields “COUGH” but H is banned, “FOULY” but F is less frequent. A better choice is “BOUND” but D is banned. Eliminating banned letters:

- Position 1: usable consonants include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y
- Positions 3,4,5: usable letters include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, I, U

“MOUND” contains D (banned).  
“BOUND” contains D (banned).  
“COULD” contains D (banned).  
“COIN” is too short.  

“FOGGY” contains F and G G Y, but F is okay (not banned) and we need one more vowel.  
“FOGGY” → second letter O, uses F, G, G, Y; no banned letters.  
“GOOFY” → second letter O, uses G, O, O, F, Y; repeated O is allowed, but let’s avoid repeats for more info.  
“MUSIC” → second letter U (wrong).  
“BOINK” → second letter O, uses B, O, I, N, K — none banned. B, I, N, K give new letters.

“BOINK” seems ideal: second letter O, and introduces B, I, N, K (none used yet), and no disallowed letters.

Therefore, I will guess “BOINK”.

Current knowledge:

1. Secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O fixed in position 2).
2. Letters that do NOT appear anywhere: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K.
3. From BOINK we learned:
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (from the unused pool) and their possible positions:

Vowels left: I (already confirmed present, wrong position), U, Y  
Consonants left to consider: C, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus repeats etc., but we’ll stick to common ones).

We need four letters (positions 1,3,4,5) drawn only from the allowed set.

Let’s list possible consonants for position 1: C, F, G, M, W, …  
Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: any from C, F, G, I, M, U, W, Y, etc. (but note I must not sit in slot 3).

We want a common word that fits _ O _ _ _ and uses only the allowed letters. Candidate words:

- COMIC – uses C, M, C; I is ok but repeats C.
- FOULY – uses F, U, L, Y; but L is banned.
- WOMBY – uses W, M, B, Y; B is banned.
- COUGH – uses C, U, G, H; H banned.
- FOGGY – uses F, G, G, Y; G repeats.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y; M repeats.

Best candidate that uses new, non-repeating letters:  
“GUMMY” – uses G, U, M, M, Y; but M repeats.  
“FOGGY” – repeats G.  
“COMFY” – uses C, O, M, F, Y.  All letters allowed and none used before.

Check each letter against the banned list:

C – allowed  
O – allowed (fixed)  
M – allowed  
F – allowed  
Y – allowed  

All letters are fresh.  Second letter O is correct.  I is already known to be present (but not in slot 3), so this guess focuses on discovering placement of I later; meanwhile we test C, M, F, Y.

So COMFY is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Looking at common letters in 5-letter words, the letters S, T, R, E, A, O, I, N are very frequent. A word like ""STARE"" contains 5 very common letters (S, T, A, R, E) and will help identify which of these letters are in the secret word. ""STARE"" is also a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I now know to avoid:

- S, T, A, R, E entirely  
- Any word that contains any of these letters.

I need a 5-letter word that does **not** contain S, T, A, R, or E.  
I also want a word with a good mix of other common letters to gain new information.  
Looking at remaining high-frequency letters:

- Common consonants left: N, L, O, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y  
- Common vowels left: I, O, U

A word that uses several of these and avoids the banned letters is “D O L P H” (DOLPH).  
It contains D, O, L, P, H — none of which appeared in the first guess.

Other options could be “CHIMP”, “BLOCK”, “FLUNK”, etc., but “DOLPH” is simple and covers a good spread of new letters.

Guess 2: DOLPH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) L(x) P(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- STARE → all letters (S T A R E) are absent.
- DOLPH → only O is present and in the correct position.

So we now know:
1. The secret word is _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2).
2. Letters to avoid so far: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H.

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is O and that contains none of the disallowed letters. The remaining common consonants are N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, etc., and remaining vowels are I, U.

I want a word that uses fresh common letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to maximize information. A quick scan yields “COUGH” but H is banned, “FOULY” but F is less frequent. A better choice is “BOUND” but D is banned. Eliminating banned letters:

- Position 1: usable consonants include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y
- Positions 3,4,5: usable letters include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, I, U

“MOUND” contains D (banned).  
“BOUND” contains D (banned).  
“COULD” contains D (banned).  
“COIN” is too short.  

“FOGGY” contains F and G G Y, but F is okay (not banned) and we need one more vowel.  
“FOGGY” → second letter O, uses F, G, G, Y; no banned letters.  
“GOOFY” → second letter O, uses G, O, O, F, Y; repeated O is allowed, but let’s avoid repeats for more info.  
“MUSIC” → second letter U (wrong).  
“BOINK” → second letter O, uses B, O, I, N, K — none banned. B, I, N, K give new letters.

“BOINK” seems ideal: second letter O, and introduces B, I, N, K (none used yet), and no disallowed letters.

Therefore, I will guess “BOINK”.

- From Guess 3 (BOINK) we learned:  
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (which is already M).  
  – So I must occupy position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed and unused so far:
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any repeats among the allowed set).

We have two slots left (positions 4 and 5).  
One of them must be I (because I is confirmed present).  
The other slot must be filled with a letter from the remaining allowed set.

Possible endings:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

To maximize the information gained, I should choose a word that contains common letters in different positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Looking at common letters in 5-letter words, the letters S, T, R, E, A, O, I, N are very frequent. A word like ""STARE"" contains 5 very common letters (S, T, A, R, E) and will help identify which of these letters are in the secret word. ""STARE"" is also a valid English word.

Other good first guesses could be ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""STARE"" seems like a solid choice with good letter coverage.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I now know to avoid:

- S, T, A, R, E entirely  
- Any word that contains any of these letters.

I need a 5-letter word that does **not** contain S, T, A, R, or E.  
I also want a word with a good mix of other common letters to gain new information.  
Looking at remaining high-frequency letters:

- Common consonants left: N, L, O, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y  
- Common vowels left: I, O, U

A word that uses several of these and avoids the banned letters is “D O L P H” (DOLPH).  
It contains D, O, L, P, H — none of which appeared in the first guess.

Other options could be “CHIMP”, “BLOCK”, “FLUNK”, etc., but “DOLPH” is simple and covers a good spread of new letters.

<guess>DOLPH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DOLPH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) L(x) P(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- STARE → all letters (S T A R E) are absent.
- DOLPH → only O is present and in the correct position.

So we now know:
1. The secret word is _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2).
2. Letters to avoid so far: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H.

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is O and that contains none of the disallowed letters. The remaining common consonants are N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, etc., and remaining vowels are I, U.

I want a word that uses fresh common letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to maximize information. A quick scan yields “COUGH” but H is banned, “FOULY” but F is less frequent. A better choice is “BOUND” but D is banned. Eliminating banned letters:

- Position 1: usable consonants include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y
- Positions 3,4,5: usable letters include N, C, G, M, B, F, K, W, Y, I, U

“MOUND” contains D (banned).  
“BOUND” contains D (banned).  
“COULD” contains D (banned).  
“COIN” is too short.  

“FOGGY” contains F and G G Y, but F is okay (not banned) and we need one more vowel.  
“FOGGY” → second letter O, uses F, G, G, Y; no banned letters.  
“GOOFY” → second letter O, uses G, O, O, F, Y; repeated O is allowed, but let’s avoid repeats for more info.  
“MUSIC” → second letter U (wrong).  
“BOINK” → second letter O, uses B, O, I, N, K — none banned. B, I, N, K give new letters.

“BOINK” seems ideal: second letter O, and introduces B, I, N, K (none used yet), and no disallowed letters.

Therefore, I will guess “BOINK”.

1. Secret word pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O fixed in position 2).
2. Letters that do NOT appear anywhere: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K.
3. From BOINK we learned:
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining candidate letters (from the unused pool) and their possible positions:

Vowels left: I (already confirmed present, wrong position), U, Y  
Consonants left to consider: C, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus repeats etc., but we’ll stick to common ones).

We need four letters (positions 1,3,4,5) drawn only from the allowed set.

Let’s list possible consonants for position 1: C, F, G, M, W, …  
Possible letters for positions 3,4,5: any from C, F, G, I, M, U, W, Y, etc. (but note I must not sit in slot 3).

We want a common word that fits _ O _ _ _ and uses only the allowed letters. Candidate words:

- COMIC – uses C, M, C; I is ok but repeats C.
- FOULY – uses F, U, L, Y; but L is banned.
- WOMBY – uses W, M, B, Y; B is banned.
- COUGH – uses C, U, G, H; H banned.
- FOGGY – uses F, G, G, Y; G repeats.
- GUMMY – uses G, U, M, M, Y; M repeats.

Best candidate that uses new, non-repeating letters:  
“GUMMY” – uses G, U, M, M, Y; but M repeats.  
“FOGGY” – repeats G.  
“COMFY” – uses C, O, M, F, Y.  All letters allowed and none used before.

Check each letter against the banned list:

C – allowed  
O – allowed (fixed)  
M – allowed  
F – allowed  
Y – allowed  

All letters are fresh.  Second letter O is correct.  I is already known to be present (but not in slot 3), so this guess focuses on discovering placement of I later; meanwhile we test C, M, F, Y.

So COMFY is a good next guess.

Current state:
Pattern: C O M I _  (positions 1-4 fixed as C O M I)
Letters already confirmed present and in place: C, O, M, I.
Letters ruled out entirely so far (from all x-marked positions): S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K, F, Y, X.

We only need the 5th letter.  
Allowed letters still unused and not ruled out: G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z (plus repeats of already used letters, but we have no repeats so far).

We must pick a single letter for position 5 from that set.  
Common English 5-letter words starting with COMI:

- COMIC – C repeats, disallowed.
- COMIT – not common.
- COMIX – already guessed (X ruled out).
- COMUS – uses U and S, but S is banned.
- COMFY – already tried (Y banned).
- COMITY – six letters.
- COMING – uses G and N, but N is banned.
- COMINO – uses N (banned).
- COMOED – uses E (banned).
- COMOUS – uses S (banned).
- Actually, there’s only one normal word left in dictionaries: COMIC (invalid) and COMIT (rare).  
  But COMIT is valid (British spelling of “commit” in some legal senses).

However, COMIT contains T, which is ruled out.

Let me double-check: what letters are definitely NOT in the word?  
From every x-marked position so far we have banned: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K, F, Y, X.  
Any other letter is allowed.

Looking again, the only remaining letter that is common in such endings and still allowed is U or G or V or W or J or Q or Z.

Available common endings for COMI-:
- U (COMIU) – no such word.
- G (COMIG) – no such word.
- V (COMIV) – no such word.
- W (COMIW) – no such word.
- J (COMIJ) – no such word.
- Q (COMIQ) – no such word.
- Z (COMIZ) – no such word.

Wait… let me scan for real words in COMI*:

COMIC – invalid (repeat C)  
COMITY – six letters  
COMING – uses N (banned)  
COMITY – too long  
COMIT – T banned  
COMIX – X banned  
COMOSE – E banned  
COMOUS – S banned  
COMOED – E banned  

This indicates the only remaining valid English 5-letter word fitting the pattern and letter constraints is:

COMIC – but C repeats (already used in position 1), and the word COMIT has T (banned).  
This suggests we must have missed something.

Let me recheck the banned list precisely:

Banned letters from every x-marked position:
S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K, F, Y, X.

Of these, the following have been excluded from appearing anywhere in the word.

So the pool of allowed letters for the last position is:  
G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z.

None of these form a recognizable English word in COMI*.  
But there is one common word we are missing: “COMIC” uses C twice – but C is already in the word once, and the rules do not forbid a letter appearing more than once unless that specific instance was marked x.

However, the rules only mark letters x if they are NOT present in the secret word.  
They do not indicate how many times a letter can appear.

Given that, the only valid 5-letter word starting with COMI and using any of G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z is none – none of them are words.

Therefore, the only possible word left with the letters we have and the pattern is COMIC, even though it repeats C.  
The letter C was only confirmed in position 1; nothing says it cannot appear again.

So COMIC is a valid English word and the only remaining candidate.

Hence, I will guess COMIC.
</think>

The feedback tells us the first four letters are C O M I and only the fifth letter is unknown.  
The only valid 5-letter English word that fits C O M I _ and does not use any banned letters is **COMIC**.

Allowed letters still unused and not ruled out: G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z (plus repeats of already used letters, but we have no repeats so far).

We must pick a single letter for position 5 from that set.  
Common English 5-letter words starting with COMI:

- COMIC – C repeats, disallowed.
- COMIT – not common.
- COMIX – already guessed (X ruled out).
- COMUS – uses U and S, but S is banned.
- COMFY – already tried (Y banned).
- COMITY – six letters.
- COMING – uses G and N, but N is banned.
- COMINO – uses N (banned).
- COMOED – uses E (banned).
- COMOUS – uses S (banned).
- Actually, there’s only one normal word left in dictionaries: COMIC (invalid) and COMIT (rare).  
  But COMIT is valid (British spelling of “commit” in some legal senses).

However, COMIT contains T, which is ruled out.

Let me double-check: what letters are definitely NOT in the word?  
From every x-marked position so far we have banned: S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K, F, Y, X.  
Any other letter is allowed.

Looking again, the only remaining letter that is common in such endings and still allowed is U or G or V or W or J or Q or Z.

Available common endings for COMI-:
- U (COMIU) – no such word.
- G (COMIG) – no such word.
- V (COMIV) – no such word.
- W (COMIW) – no such word.
- J (COMIJ) – no such word.
- Q (COMIQ) – no such word.
- Z (COMIZ) – no such word.

Wait… let me scan for real words in COMI*:

COMIC – invalid (repeat C)  
COMITY – six letters  
COMING – uses N (banned)  
COMITY – too long  
COMIT – T banned  
COMIX – X banned  
COMOSE – E banned  
COMOUS – S banned  
COMOED – E banned  

This indicates the only remaining valid English 5-letter word fitting the pattern and letter constraints is:

COMIC – but C repeats (already used in position 1), and the word COMIT has T (banned).  
This suggests we must have missed something.

Let me recheck the banned list precisely:

Banned letters from every x-marked position:
S, T, A, R, E, D, L, P, H, B, N, K, F, Y, X.

Of these, the following have been excluded from appearing anywhere in the word.

So the pool of allowed letters for the last position is:  
G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z.

None of these form a recognizable English word in COMI*.  
But there is one common word we are missing: “COMIC” uses C twice – but C is already in the word once, and the rules do not forbid a letter appearing more than once unless that specific instance was marked x.

However, the rules only mark letters x if they are NOT present in the secret word.  
They do not indicate how many times a letter can appear.

Given that, the only valid 5-letter word starting with COMI and using any of G, J, Q, U, V, W, Z is none – none of them are words.

Therefore, the only possible word left with the letters we have and the pattern is COMIC, even though it repeats C.  
The letter C was only confirmed in position 1; nothing says it cannot appear again.

So COMIC is a valid English word and the only remaining candidate.

Hence, I will guess COMIC.The feedback tells us the first four letters are C O M I and only the fifth letter is unknown.  
The only valid 5-letter English word that fits C O M I _ and does not use any banned letters is **COMIC**.",Guess 6: COMIC -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
