For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the target word. A good starting word should include:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. At least one less common letter to test

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it covers:
- A (vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants in one guess. However, another strong contender is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - hitting S, T, L as common consonants plus A and E.

I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it tests both S and L which are very common, plus the T which appears in many words. Let's go with SLATE as it gives good coverage of common letters.

Current confirmed facts:
- T is somewhere in the word, but it is NOT in the 4th position (because Guess 2 had T in position 4 and it got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but in the wrong spot).
- Letters that have been eliminated entirely: S, L, A, E, F, R, O, N.

We therefore need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains T exactly once.
2. Has T NOT in position 4.
3. Contains none of the letters S, L, A, E, F, R, O, N.

Available letters (from the rest of the alphabet) include:
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

A good second-stage opener is “DITCH” because:
- It introduces four new consonants (D, C, H) plus I & U variants aren’t needed yet.
- T is in position 3, satisfying “T exists but is not in position 4.”
- It uses none of the eliminated letters.

But wait—does DITCH include any of the forbidden letters?  
D, I, T, C, H — none are S, L, A, E, F, R, O, N.  
So DITCH is valid.

Current confirmed information:
- Position 4 is **not** T (from FRONT feedback).
- T is **somewhere** in the word (from SLATE and DITCH).
- I is in the word **somewhere** (from DITCH feedback).
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, E, F, R, O, N, D, C, H.

Thus the word must:
1. Contain both I and T.
2. Place T **not** in position 4.
3. Use only un-eliminated letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and T.

Possible un-eliminated vowels: I (already known), U.  
We still need to test U to see if it appears.

We want a word that:
- Uses T and I.
- Places T somewhere other than position 4.
- Introduces U (the only untested vowel) and a couple of new consonants.

Candidate words:
- ""UNITY"" – uses U, N (eliminated), I, T, Y → invalid (N is out).
- ""QUICK"" – uses Q, U, I, C (eliminated), K → invalid (C is out).
- ""TUMID"" – uses T, U, M, I, D (eliminated) → invalid (D is out).
- ""BRUIT"" – uses B, R (eliminated), U, I, T → invalid (R is out).

Let’s try ""BUILT"":
- B, U, I, L (eliminated), T → invalid (L is out).

Next try ""GUILT"":
- G, U, I, L (eliminated), T → invalid (L is out).

Next try ""QUIET"":
- Q, U, I, E (eliminated), T → invalid (E is out).

Next try ""TWIXT"":
- T, W, I, X, T → has T twice (but we don’t know if T appears once or twice). However, it’s a valid word and places T in positions 1 and 5, neither is 4.

But we can avoid double T. Try ""MIXIT"" – but M, I, X, I, T – double I and not a common word.

Best simple choice: ""GUILT"" is invalid. Try ""KITTY"" – but double T and double T is risky.

Try ""PITHY"":
- P, I, T, H (eliminated), Y → invalid (H is out).

Try ""VITAL"":
- V, I, T, A (eliminated), L (eliminated) → invalid.

Try ""JUMPY"":
- No I or T, so invalid.

Try ""MUSTY"":
- M, U, S (eliminated), T, Y → invalid (S is out).

Try ""BUMPY"":
- No I or T.

Try ""MUSIC"":
- M, U, S (eliminated), I, C (eliminated) → invalid.

Try ""KUMQUAT"" – too long.

Finally, try ""QUIET"" – again E is out.

Realize we’re being too constrained. Let’s list valid un-eliminated letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, T.

We need a word using I and T, T not in 4, and using none of the eliminated letters.

Look for a word like ""_ I _ T _"" or ""_ _ I T _"" etc.

Try ""WITTY"":
- W, I, T, T, Y – has double T (possible), places T in 3. Valid letters: W, I, T, Y. All un-eliminated.

""WITTY"" is a valid 5-letter word, uses known I, known T not in 4, and tests W and Y.
