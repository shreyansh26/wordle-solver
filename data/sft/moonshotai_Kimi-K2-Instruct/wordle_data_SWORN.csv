Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives good coverage of common letters to identify what's in the word and what's not.

From the feedback on “AROSE”:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- R and S are in the word but in wrong positions (they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- A and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _
Letters we know are in the word: R, S, O
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, E (plus any duplicates of those)

Next step is to place R and S in other positions while avoiding A, E. We also want to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.

Good candidates: I, N, T, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

One strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- R is placed in position 1 (not yet ruled out).
- O is already fixed in position 3.
- U, N, D are common unused letters.
- S hasn’t been placed yet, but “ROUND” doesn’t use S; instead, it tests new letters. Alternatively, we could use S in a new position.

Another candidate is “SWORD”:
- S is placed in position 1 (not yet ruled out).
- W, R, D are new letters; R must fit somewhere else.
But since R is in position 2 in “AROSE” and got “-”, we know R is NOT in position 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. Position 3 is O, so R could be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “SPORT”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- P, T are new letters.
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R is in position 4 (not ruled out yet).

This seems good because it puts S in a new spot and keeps R in an allowed position while testing P and T.

However, let me think of a word that places R and S in new allowed positions while keeping O in position 3. The word “STORM” would place:
- S in position 1,
- T new,
- O in position 3,
- R in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 2 before),
- M new.

This seems optimal.

So my next guess is STORM.

- S W O R N  – W and N are possible; “SWORN” is valid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two rows of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
2. STORM → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)

From these we can deduce:

- Fixed letters:
  – Position 1: S (✓ in STORM)
  – Position 3: O (✓ in both rows)
  – Position 4: R (✓ in STORM)

So the pattern is: S _ O R _

- Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed: none remain, because R and S are now placed correctly.

- Letters known NOT to be present at all: A, E, T, M.

- Letters that remain possible for the two blank spots (positions 2 and 5): any consonant or vowel not yet eliminated.

Common unused letters that fit: I, N, L, U, Y, C, F, G, H, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that looks like S _ O R _.

Quick brainstorm:
- S I O R T  – but T is out.
- S I O R N  – “SIONR” not a word.
- S P O R K  – P and K are still possible; “SPORK” is a valid word.
- S W O R N  – W and N are possible; “SWORN” is valid.
- S C O R N  – C and N are possible; “SCORN” is valid.

“SCORN” is nice because C and N are common, and it hasn’t used any of the eliminated letters.

Check elimination list: A, E, T, M – none of them appear in SCORN. Also, all letters are unique, avoiding any possible duplicate issues.

Therefore, “SCORN” is a strong next guess.

Possible words satisfying this:

- SWORE – uses W and E; E is eliminated.
- SNORT – uses N and T; T is eliminated.
- SHORN – uses H and N; neither is eliminated.

Both fit the constraints. Between them:

- SWORD has W and D

Both N and D have not yet been tested.

However, N already appeared in SCORN as ✓ in position 5, so it’s proven to be a valid letter. Using N again in position 5 is safe.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives good coverage of common letters to identify what's in the word and what's not.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “AROSE”:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- R and S are in the word but in wrong positions (they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- A and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _
Letters we know are in the word: R, S, O
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, E (plus any duplicates of those)

Next step is to place R and S in other positions while avoiding A, E. We also want to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.

Good candidates: I, N, T, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

One strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- R is placed in position 1 (not yet ruled out).
- O is already fixed in position 3.
- U, N, D are common unused letters.
- S hasn’t been placed yet, but “ROUND” doesn’t use S; instead, it tests new letters. Alternatively, we could use S in a new position.

Another candidate is “SWORD”:
- S is placed in position 1 (not yet ruled out).
- W, R, D are new letters; R must fit somewhere else.
But since R is in position 2 in “AROSE” and got “-”, we know R is NOT in position 2, so R could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. Position 3 is O, so R could be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “SPORT”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- P, T are new letters.
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R is in position 4 (not ruled out yet).

This seems good because it puts S in a new spot and keeps R in an allowed position while testing P and T.

However, let me think of a word that places R and S in new allowed positions while keeping O in position 3. The word “STORM” would place:
- S in position 1,
- T new,
- O in position 3,
- R in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 2 before),
- M new.

This seems optimal.

Current known facts:

Pattern: S _ O R N  (positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed)
Letters already proven ✓: S, O, R, N
Letters proven x (not in word): A, E, T, M, C, H

Position 2 remains the only unknown.

Allowed letters for position 2: any letter not yet eliminated and not already used in the word (to avoid repeats).

Eliminated so far: A, E, T, M, C, H  
Already used: S, O, R, N  

Remaining alphabet letters that fit in position 2: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word spelled S _ O R N.

Looking at the dictionary, the only common English word that fits is:

S B O R N → doesn’t exist  
S D O R N → doesn’t exist  
S F O R N → doesn’t exist  
S G O R N → doesn’t exist  
S I O R N → doesn’t exist  
S J O R N → doesn’t exist  
S K O R N → doesn’t exist  
S L O R N → doesn’t exist  
S P O R N → no (sporn is obsolete)  
S Q O R N → doesn’t exist  
S U O R N → doesn’t exist  
S V O R N → doesn’t exist  
S W O R N → SWORN (valid word)

SWORN uses W for position 2, and W has not been used or eliminated.
