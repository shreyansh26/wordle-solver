For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly narrow down possible letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opener because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me determine which vowels are present and potentially the positions of R and S.

The feedback tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So the word must contain an A somewhere other than the first letter, and must **exclude** R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A (but not in the first position).
2. Does **not** use R, O, S, E.
3. Uses common letters still allowed.

Remaining common consonants after removing R/S: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Common vowels after removing O/E: I, U.

A good candidate is “ADMIT”:

- Uses M, D, I, T (none excluded).
- Common letters and a valid word.

From the two rounds so far we know:

Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, D, I, T  
Known-present letters (but not yet in the correct spot):  
- A (must be in positions 2-5)  
- M (must be in positions 1-4, since it can’t be in position 3 where it appeared)

That leaves the remaining valid letters: A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we prefer common ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and M.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places M somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

A quick scan of common words fitting these constraints gives “CAMPS” (but S is out), “LAMPS” (S out), “HUMID” (I/D out), “UMBRA” (R out), etc.

A valid candidate that avoids all banned letters and meets the constraints is “MAMMA”:
- M is allowed in positions 1,2,4,5 (positions 2 and 3 are present; it’s allowed in 2,4,5).
- A appears twice, and can sit in positions 2,3,4,5.
- No excluded letters appear.

However, “MAMMA” repeats letters, which may not be the most informative.

A better choice is “MACHO” (but O is excluded), “MACAW” (W is allowed), “MACON” (O/N excluded), “MACED” (E/D excluded).

Another valid word is “MANLY”:
- Contains M and A.
- Positions: M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).
- No excluded letters.
- A in position 2 (still needs to find its final place).

From the latest feedback:
- M is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- Y is in position 5 (✓).
- L is NOT in the word (x).

So the word looks like: M A N _ Y.

The missing letter must be:
- Not any of the already excluded letters: R, O, S, E, D, I, T, L.
- Still allowed letters include: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and A, M, N, Y are already placed).

We need a single letter to fill the 4th position that makes a valid 5-letter word starting with M-A-N-?-Y.

Possible valid completions:
- MANCY (valid but less common)
- MANGY (common, means shabby/unkempt)
- MANLY (already guessed)
- MANTY (not a valid word)

""MANGY"" is the only common and valid word fitting the pattern.
