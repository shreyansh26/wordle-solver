For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can provide useful information regardless of the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are good choices. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often considered a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives it a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. 

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

Let’s summarize what we now know from all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminated letters: A, R, E  
   ⇒ Present letters (somewhere): O, S

2. STOIC → S(✓) T(-) O(-) I(x) C(x)  
   ⇒ S is fixed in position 1  
   ⇒ T is somewhere (but not in position 2)  
   ⇒ O is somewhere (but not in position 3)  
   ⇒ Eliminated letters: I, C

3. SPOUT → S(✓) P(x) O(-) U(-) T(-)  
   ⇒ P is eliminated  
   ⇒ U is somewhere (but not in position 4)  
   ⇒ T is somewhere (but not in position 5)  
   ⇒ O is somewhere (but not in position 3)

So far:

- First letter is S (fixed).  
- Word must contain: O, T, U  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, E, I, C, P  
- O cannot be in position 3.  
- T cannot be in positions 2 or 5.  
- U cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for O, T, U (positions 2–5) respecting the constraints:

Positions 2-5: _ _ _ _

Letters left available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known O, T, U.

We need to place O, T, U into the remaining four positions (positions 2-5) with the constraints:
- T ≠ 2, ≠ 5  
- O ≠ 3  
- U ≠ 4

Let’s list possible placements:

T can be 3 or 4.  
U can be 2, 3, or 5.  
O can be 2, 4, or 5.

We need to assign O, T, U to three different positions out of 2-5, leaving one position for a new letter from the remaining pool.

Let’s enumerate valid (O, T, U) positions:

1. T=3:  
   - O and U must be in 2,4,5 with O≠3 (already), U≠4.  
   Possible:  
   - O=2, U=5 → Need letter for position 4  
   - O=5, U=2 → Need letter for position 4  

2. T=4:  
   - O and U must be in 2,3,5 with O≠3, U≠4 (already).  
   Possible:  
   - O=2, U=5 → Need letter for position 3  
   - O=5, U=2 → Need letter for position 3  
   - O=5, U=3 → But U≠4 is already satisfied, but O=5 is okay, but need to check U=3 (no restriction) → Need letter for position 2  

Let’s pick the first valid combination: T=3, O=2, U=5 → positions 2=O, 3=T, 5=U → position 4 needs a letter from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common letter in this pool is N → S O T N U.

Let’s check constraints:
- S(1) ✓
- O(2): not in 3 ✓
- T(3): not in 2 or 5 ✓
- N(4): no restriction ✓
- U(5): not in 4 ✓

This fits all constraints. Let’s try SOTNU. But SOTNU is not a valid English word. 

Next valid combination: T=3, O=5, U=2 → positions 2=U, 3=T, 5=O → need letter for position 4 → S U T _ O. A valid word here is SUTON? No, not valid. SUTRO? No.

Next valid combination: T=4, O=2, U=5 → positions 2=O, 4=T, 5=U → need letter for 3 → S O _ T U. A valid word is SOUTH.

Check SOUTH:
- S(1) ✓
- O(2): not in 3 ✓
- U(5): not in 4 ✓
- T(4): not in 2 or 5 ✓
- H(3): no restriction ✓

SOUTH is a valid English word and fits all constraints.
