- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common letter)

This should give us a good sense of which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

The feedback from CRANE:
C(x) – C is not in the word.

A(-) – A appears in the word but is not in position 2.  
N(-) – N appears in the word but is not in position 4.

So the secret word contains A and N, but they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
We also know it definitely does NOT contain C, R, or E.

I’ll choose a new word that:

- moves A away from position 2,

- avoids C, R, E entirely,  
- introduces other common, unused letters (S, T, L, O, etc.).

A good candidate is “STAND”:

- D is another new consonant.

Summary of feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A (must appear somewhere, just not in positions 2 or 3)
- N (must appear somewhere, just not in positions 2 or 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
C, R, E, S, T, D

Positions still open for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but from STAND, A was in 3 and got “-”, so A cannot be in 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5).

Positions still open for N: 1, 3, 5 (N was in 2 & 4 already).

Remaining frequent consonants that have not been tried yet: L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

We also need a vowel besides A; other vowels we haven’t tried: I, O, U (and Y).

Good candidates should:
– contain both A and N in permissible spots.
– avoid any disallowed letters.
– introduce new common letters.

Let’s test the word “PLANK”:
- P: new
- L: new
- A: position 3 — but feedback from STAND already ruled out A in position 3. That’s a conflict.

Next: “BLANK”
- B: new
- L: new
- A: position 2 — ruled out by CRANE. Conflict.

“PAINT”
- T already excluded.

“MANLY”
- A in position 2 — ruled out.

“HUMAN”
- A in position 4 – allowed
- N in position 5 – allowed
- H, U, M all new letters

“HUMAN” is a valid candidate.

Another possible is “NINJA” – but N would repeat, which is allowed but may not help much.

Let’s go with HUMAN.

Check constraints:
Letters used: H, U, M, A, N
- H, U, M not yet used.
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)
No letters from the forbidden list appear.

So: HUMAN.
