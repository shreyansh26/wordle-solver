For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:  
- A is somewhere in the word, just not in position 1.  
- E is somewhere in the word, just not in position 5.  

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
- R, O, S (so avoid these completely).  

So the next word must:
1. Contain both A and E at positions other than 1 and 5 respectively.
2. Avoid R, O, S.
3. Use only remaining letters.

Available letters: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z plus A and E.

A good follow-up word that fits these constraints and still covers common unused letters is:

- T: very common consonant, not yet tested.  
- A: must appear, not at position 1.  
- I: common vowel, not yet tested.  
- E: must appear, not at position 5.  
- N: common consonant, not yet tested.

Putting them together while satisfying the positions:  
If we try T A I N E, the A is in position 2 (not 1) and the E is in position 5 (forbidden), so this fails.  
Re-arranging: T I N A E keeps A in 4 and E in 5 – still fails for E.  
Swap E elsewhere: T I E N A – A is in 5 and E is in 3. Now A is allowed (only restriction was not position 1) and E is allowed (only restriction was not position 5).  

So: T I E N A.

This uses T, I, N (all new), plus required A and E in allowable positions.

From the feedback so far:

We know:
- E is in position 3 (E✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (N-).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (A- from AROSE and TIENA).
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: R, O, S, T, I.

So the word must contain: A, E, N  
Positions:
- E must be in position 3.
- A must be in position 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by E → A must be in position 2.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Position 2 is A, 3 is E → so N must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we can't use R, O, S, T, I.

- Position 3: E
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: N in position 1
Word: N A E _ _

We need two more letters from remaining pool. Common ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, etc.

Possible words:
- N A E B _ → N A E B L? Not valid.
- N A E D _ → N A E D Y? Not common.
- N A E M _ → N A E M O? O is out.
- N A E P _ → N A E P S? S is out.
- N A E L _ → N A E L K? Doesn't seem valid.
- N A E B _ → N A E B D? Doesn't seem valid.

Case 2: N in position 4
Word: _ A E N _

Possible:
- B A E N _ → B A E N D? Not a word.
- C A E N _ → C A E N T? T is out.
- D A E N _ → Doesn't fit.
- H A E N _ → Doesn't fit.

Case 3: N in position 5
Word: _ A E _ N

Possible:
- C A E D N? Not valid.
- H A E L N? Not valid.
- M A E L N? Not valid.
- P A E L N? Not valid.
- G A E L N? Not valid.

Looking for valid words fitting _ A E _ N or similar. The most common word fitting these constraints is:

F A E C N? Doesn't seem valid.
D A E M N? Doesn't seem valid.

Actually, let's try:
- N _ A E _ → but A is fixed at 2, E at 3.

Wait, let's re-express:

Current confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E
- N is in word, not position 4 (from TIENA).
- A is in word, not positions 1,4,5 → so must be in 2 (since 3 is E).
- So word must be: _ A E _ _

And N must be in 1 or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Looking for valid 5-letter words with:
_ A E _ N or N A E _ _

Valid words:
- N A E V E? E is already in 3.
- N A E D A? Doesn't fit.
- C A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- G A E N? Too short.
- B A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- D A N E S? S is out.
- F A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- P A N E D? Doesn't fit.

Realizing the constraints are tight. Let me think differently: the word must be _ A E _ _, with N in 1 or 5.

Looking at common words:
- N A E V E? Not valid.
- G A E N? No.
- M A E N? No.

Actually, ""NAEVI"" is plural of naevus, but not common.

""NAEVE"" is not a word.

""FAECE"" is not valid.

""CAESE"" is not valid.

""HAESE"" is not valid.

""MAEVE"" is a name, not likely.

""DAEJE"" is not valid.

""PAEON"" is a word, but N is in 5:
P A E O N? O is out.

""CAEON"" is not valid.

""BAEON"" is not valid.

""GAELN"" is not valid.

""PAEAN"" – let's check:
P A E A N:
- P: allowed
- A: allowed in 2
- E: allowed in 3
- A: but A is already used in 2. Can A appear twice? The feedback doesn't say A can't appear multiple times, but original feedback only shows one instance of A.

""PAEAN"" is a valid word meaning song of praise. Let's check constraints:
- P: allowed (not R,O,S,T,I)
- A: allowed in 2
- E: must be in 3 – fits
- A: second A – allowed?
- N: must be in 5 (since 4 is excluded) – fits

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Is there a better word? Let me think of others:
- N A E V E – E already in 3
- N A E D E – same
- N A E L E – same
- N A E M E – same
- N A E P E – same
- N A E G E – same

""PAEAN"" seems the most plausible valid word fitting the constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- E is in position 3.
- A must be in position 2 (since it can't be 1,4,5 and 3 is E).
- N must be in position 1 or 5 (can't be 4, and 2,3,4 are taken by A,E).
- R,O,S,T,I are excluded.

- P (allowed)
- A (position 2)
- E (position 3)
- A (second A is allowed)
- N (position 5)

""PAEAN"" – let's check:
P A E A N:
- P: allowed
- A: allowed in 2
- E: allowed in 3
- A: but A is already used in 2. Can A appear twice? The feedback doesn't say A can't appear multiple times, but original feedback only shows one instance of A.

""PAEAN"" is a valid word meaning song of praise. Let's check constraints:
- P: allowed (not R,O,S,T,I)
- A: allowed in 2
- E: must be in 3 – fits
- A: second A – allowed?
- N: must be in 5 (since 4 is excluded) – fits

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Is there a better word? Let me think of others:
- N A E V E – E already in 3
- N A E D E – same
- N A E L E – same
- N A E M E – same
- N A E P E – same
- N A E G E – same

""PAEAN"" seems the most plausible valid word fitting the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- E is in position 3.
- A must be in position 2 (since it can't be 1,4,5 and 3 is E).
- N must be in position 1 or 5 (can't be 4, and 2,3,4 are taken by A,E).
- R,O,S,T,I are excluded.

The word ""PAEAN"" fits:
- P (allowed)
- A (position 2)
- E (position 3)
- A (second A is allowed)
- N (position 5)",Guess 3: PAEAN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) E(✓) A(✓) N(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:  
- A is somewhere in the word, just not in position 1.  
- E is somewhere in the word, just not in position 5.  

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
- R, O, S (so avoid these completely).  

So the next word must:
1. Contain both A and E at positions other than 1 and 5 respectively.
2. Avoid R, O, S.
3. Use only remaining letters.

Available letters: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z plus A and E.

A good follow-up word that fits these constraints and still covers common unused letters is:

- T: very common consonant, not yet tested.  
- A: must appear, not at position 1.  
- I: common vowel, not yet tested.  
- E: must appear, not at position 5.  
- N: common consonant, not yet tested.

Putting them together while satisfying the positions:  
If we try T A I N E, the A is in position 2 (not 1) and the E is in position 5 (forbidden), so this fails.  
Re-arranging: T I N A E keeps A in 4 and E in 5 – still fails for E.  
Swap E elsewhere: T I E N A – A is in 5 and E is in 3. Now A is allowed (only restriction was not position 1) and E is allowed (only restriction was not position 5).  

So: T I E N A.

This uses T, I, N (all new), plus required A and E in allowable positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIENA -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) E(✓) N(-) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

We know:
- E is in position 3 (E✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (N-).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (A- from AROSE and TIENA).
- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: R, O, S, T, I.

So the word must contain: A, E, N  
Positions:
- E must be in position 3.
- A must be in position 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by E → A must be in position 2.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Position 2 is A, 3 is E → so N must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we can't use R, O, S, T, I.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have two more letters to place. Since we have:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: N in position 1
Word: N A E _ _

We need two more letters from remaining pool. Common ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, etc.

Possible words:
- N A E B _ → N A E B L? Not valid.
- N A E D _ → N A E D Y? Not common.
- N A E M _ → N A E M O? O is out.
- N A E P _ → N A E P S? S is out.
- N A E L _ → N A E L K? Doesn't seem valid.
- N A E B _ → N A E B D? Doesn't seem valid.

Case 2: N in position 4
Word: _ A E N _

Possible:
- B A E N _ → B A E N D? Not a word.
- C A E N _ → C A E N T? T is out.
- D A E N _ → Doesn't fit.
- H A E N _ → Doesn't fit.

Case 3: N in position 5
Word: _ A E _ N

Possible:
- C A E D N? Not valid.
- H A E L N? Not valid.
- M A E L N? Not valid.
- P A E L N? Not valid.
- G A E L N? Not valid.

Looking for valid words fitting _ A E _ N or similar. The most common word fitting these constraints is:

F A E C N? Doesn't seem valid.
D A E M N? Doesn't seem valid.

Actually, let's try:
- N _ A E _ → but A is fixed at 2, E at 3.

Wait, let's re-express:

Current confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: E
- N is in word, not position 4 (from TIENA).
- A is in word, not positions 1,4,5 → so must be in 2 (since 3 is E).
- So word must be: _ A E _ _

And N must be in 1 or 5 (since 4 is excluded).

Looking for valid 5-letter words with:
_ A E _ N or N A E _ _

Valid words:
- N A E V E? E is already in 3.
- N A E D A? Doesn't fit.
- C A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- G A E N? Too short.
- B A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- D A N E S? S is out.
- F A N E D? Doesn't fit.
- P A N E D? Doesn't fit.

Realizing the constraints are tight. Let me think differently: the word must be _ A E _ _, with N in 1 or 5.

Looking at common words:
- N A E V E? Not valid.
- G A E N? No.
- M A E N? No.
