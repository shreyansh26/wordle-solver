For the first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with common consonants and vowels like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: S, L, T

This should give good feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.
