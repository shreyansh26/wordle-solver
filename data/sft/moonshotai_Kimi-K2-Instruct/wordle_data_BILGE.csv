For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me identify common letters in the English language. A good opening word should include common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, T, N, S, L). 

Looking at these criteria, the word ""AROSE"" comes to mind because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, which maximizes the information gained from the feedback
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

The feedback tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.  
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

We still need a consonant-heavy guess to test new consonants. Good remaining consonants to probe are T, N, L, C, D, M, H, etc.

A simple word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S is “UNTIE”.  
- U and N are new vowel/consonant tests.

From the feedback so far:

1. E is fixed in the final position (✓).
2. I is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  
   - Therefore I cannot be in position 4 (where it appeared in UNTIE).
3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants to test next: D, L, C, M, H, G, B, F, etc.

I’ll choose a word that:
- ends in E,
- uses I in position 2 (to test that placement),
- introduces two new consonants (M and L),
- avoids all banned letters.

A good candidate is “MILE_” – but I need a 5-letter word ending in E.  
“MILDE” isn’t valid, so I’ll pivot to “LIME_” – same issue.  
A valid word that fits is “CHILE” but C and H are untested. Actually, let’s keep it simpler: “FLIME” is invalid. A valid option that uses two new consonants and keeps I in position 2 is “FLITE” (invalid). Try “CHIDE” – valid. But C and H are risky. Let’s use “CLIMB” but that doesn’t end in E.  

A simpler valid word is “WHITE”:
- W, H, T are new tests, but T is already banned.  
Oops, T is banned.

Valid word avoiding all banned letters: “CHIDE” uses C, H, I, D, E. D is new, C and H are new.  

Let me pick “CHIDE”.

But I is in the wrong place in “UNTIE” (position 4), so in “CHIDE” it’s in position 3 – acceptable.  

Actually, let’s pick “WHILE”:
- W, H, L are new, I in position 2.
Checks:
- Ends with E (✓).  
- I in position 2 (was in 4 last time, so not a repeat of same wrong spot).  
- W, H, L are new consonants.  
- Avoids all banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T are absent.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good opening word should include common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, T, N, S, L). 

Looking at these criteria, the word ""AROSE"" comes to mind because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, which maximizes the information gained from the feedback
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.  
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

We still need a consonant-heavy guess to test new consonants. Good remaining consonants to probe are T, N, L, C, D, M, H, etc.

A simple word that ends in E and avoids A, R, O, S is “UNTIE”.  
- U and N are new vowel/consonant tests.  
- T and I are new tests (I is a vowel we haven’t checked).  
- It ends in E, matching the known position.

Let me pick “UNTIE”.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. E is fixed in the final position (✓).
2. I is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  
   - Therefore I cannot be in position 4 (where it appeared in UNTIE).
3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants to test next: D, L, C, M, H, G, B, F, etc.

I’ll choose a word that:
- ends in E,
- uses I in position 2 (to test that placement),
- introduces two new consonants (M and L),
- avoids all banned letters.

A good candidate is “MILE_” – but I need a 5-letter word ending in E.  
“MILDE” isn’t valid, so I’ll pivot to “LIME_” – same issue.  
A valid word that fits is “CHILE” but C and H are untested. Actually, let’s keep it simpler: “FLIME” is invalid. A valid option that uses two new consonants and keeps I in position 2 is “FLITE” (invalid). Try “CHIDE” – valid. But C and H are risky. Let’s use “CLIMB” but that doesn’t end in E.  

A simpler valid word is “WHITE”:
- W, H, T are new tests, but T is already banned.  
Oops, T is banned.

Valid word avoiding all banned letters: “CHIDE” uses C, H, I, D, E. D is new, C and H are new.  

Let me pick “CHIDE”.

But I is in the wrong place in “UNTIE” (position 4), so in “CHIDE” it’s in position 3 – acceptable.  

Actually, let’s pick “WHILE”:
- W, H, L are new, I in position 2.
Checks:
- Ends with E (✓).  
- I in position 2 (was in 4 last time, so not a repeat of same wrong spot).  
- W, H, L are new consonants.  
- Avoids all banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T are absent.

Yes, “WHILE” is a valid choice.

Let me compile the constraints so far:

Knowns:

- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.

Ruled-out letters (x in any guess): A, R, O, S, U, N, T, W, H, F, D.

Remaining valid positions:
I can be in position 1 or 2.  
L can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 5 is already E, so L is in 1 or 3.  
Therefore I and L must occupy positions 1–3, with no overlap.

Possible patterns:
1. I _ L _ E  (I in 1, L in 3)
2. I L _ _ E  (I in 1, L in 2)  → but L cannot be in 2, so invalid.
3. _ I L _ E  (I in 2, L in 3)
4. L I _ _ E  (L in 1, I in 2)

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

- M I L _ E → but M must be in word, and D is banned. ""MILDE"" invalid.
- V I L _ E → no.
- B I L _ E → ""BILGE"" – check letters: B, I, L, G, E – none are banned. Fits pattern _ I L _ E with I in 2, L in 3.

""BILGE"" satisfies:
- Ends in E.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters B, G are new and allowed.

<guess>BILGE</guess>",BILGE,"Let me compile the constraints so far:

Knowns:
- The word ends in E (✓ in position 5).
- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.

Ruled-out letters (x in any guess): A, R, O, S, U, N, T, W, H, F, D.

Remaining valid positions:
I can be in position 1 or 2.  
L can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
But position 5 is already E, so L is in 1 or 3.  
Therefore I and L must occupy positions 1–3, with no overlap.

Possible patterns:
1. I _ L _ E  (I in 1, L in 3)
2. I L _ _ E  (I in 1, L in 2)  → but L cannot be in 2, so invalid.
3. _ I L _ E  (I in 2, L in 3)
4. L I _ _ E  (L in 1, I in 2)

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in E with no banned letters and fitting one of the above patterns.

Checking candidates:
- I L I _ E → invalid (duplicate I).
- I B L _ E → ""IBLE"" no.
- I C L _ E → ""ICLE"" no.
- I G L _ E → ""IGL_"" no.
- L I C _ E → ""LIC_E"" no.
- L I G _ E → ""LIG_E"" no.
- L I M _ E → ""LIMBE"" invalid/no.
- L I P _ E → ""LIPE?"" no.
- L I V _ E → ""LIV_E"" → ""LIVRE"" 5 letters, ends in E, but R banned (R is banned).
- L I Z _ E → no.
- M I L _ E → but M must be in word, and D is banned. ""MILDE"" invalid.
- V I L _ E → no.
- B I L _ E → ""BILGE"" – check letters: B, I, L, G, E – none are banned. Fits pattern _ I L _ E with I in 2, L in 3.

""BILGE"" satisfies:
- Ends in E.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters B, G are new and allowed.",Guess 5: BILGE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) L(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
