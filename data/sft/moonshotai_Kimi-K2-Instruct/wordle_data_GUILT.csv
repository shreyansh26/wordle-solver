For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me good information about a wide range of common letters in the English language. The goal is to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible while also potentially getting some positional information.

A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - another solid choice
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - hits most common vowels and some consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me maximum information potential from the first guess.

All five letters (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the five most common vowels and two very common consonants.  
Now I must pick a word that contains none of those letters and still gives good coverage of the remaining alphabet.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Among these, “T” is the single most frequent consonant still allowed.  
A good second-guess word should include several other high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out, ideally mixing consonants and the only vowel still available (I or U).

A classic choice that avoids A, R, O, S, E and contains T plus other useful letters is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y).  
This gives one vowel (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, Y) to test.

Another solid alternative would be “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D), but “UNITY” is slightly more balanced in letter frequency.  
I’ll go with “UNITY”.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all out (x)
2. UNITY → U(-), N(x), I(✓), T(-), Y(x)

Interpretation:
- I is definitely in the word and is in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- U and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
- N and Y are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Pattern so far: _ _ I _ _
- Letters to place: U, T (both must move to different slots)
- Letters to avoid: A, R, O, S, E, N, Y

Remaining common letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z, plus the two confirmed letters U and T.

We need a five-letter word that
  – has I in the 3rd position,
  – contains both U and T exactly once each, but not in their original positions,
  – uses only letters from the allowed set above.

Candidate slots for U and T:
- U cannot be in position 1 (was in position 1 in UNITY), so possible: 2, 3 (but 3 is I), 4, 5 → 2, 4, 5
- T cannot be in position 4 (was in position 4 in UNITY), so possible: 1, 2, 3 (taken), 5 → 1, 2, 5

Let’s brainstorm a word that satisfies these constraints.

One straightforward possibility: PIVOT – but we already ruled out O and T was in position 4, so this is invalid.

Another check: DITCH – contains I in 3rd, T, but has C and H which are allowed, but no U. So invalid.

Try “BUILD” – but B, U, I, L, D: has U and I, but no T. Invalid.

We need a word with I in 3rd and both U and T elsewhere.  
Let’s list some:

– T U _ I _ : but we need a 5-letter word with I in 3rd, and T and U elsewhere.  
  Example: “TULIP” – contains U and I and T, but has P which is allowed, and L is allowed.  
  But I is in 3rd, U in 2nd, T in 1st. T and U are not in their original positions (from UNITY: U was 1st, T was 4th), so this fits.

Check letters: T, U, L, I, P – none have been ruled out except N, Y, A, R, O, S, E. All these are allowed.

Thus, the next guess is “TULIP”.

We need a word with I in 3rd and both U and T elsewhere.  
Let’s list some:

– T U _ I _ : but we need a 5-letter word with I in 3rd, and T and U elsewhere.  
  Example: “TULIP” – contains U and I and T, but has P which is allowed, and L is allowed.  
  But I is in 3rd, U in 2nd, T in 1st. T and U are not in their original positions (from UNITY: U was 1st, T was 4th), so this fits.

Check letters: T, U, L, I, P – none have been ruled out except N, Y, A, R, O, S, E. All these are allowed.

Thus, the next guess is “TULIP”.

Let’s parse the new feedback from Guess 3: TULIP → T(-) U(✓) L(-) I(-) P(x)

- T is in the secret word but not in position 1 (-).
- U is in the word **and** in the correct position 2 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- I is in the word but **not** in position 4 (-) — yet we already knew from Guess 2 that I is in position 3 (✓). This apparent contradiction simply means the feedback for I in position 4 is “wrong position”, confirming I must still be in position 3.
- P is not in the word (x).

Summary of known facts:
1. Word pattern: _ U I _ _
2. Letters that must be present: I (pos 3), U (pos 2), T, L
3. Letters that must **not** appear: A, R, O, S, E, N, Y, P
4. Remaining consonants to place: T and L in positions 1, 4, or 5, with T not in 1 (since T(-) in Guess 3 position 1).

So we must arrange T and L into positions 1, 4, 5 with:
- T cannot be in 1 (from TULIP feedback), so T must be in 4 or 5.
- L must go in one of positions 1, 4, 5 (but not 3).

Possible patterns:
- T in 4: _ U I T _  → then L must go in 1 or 5.
- T in 5: _ U I _ T → then L must go in 1 or 4.

Let’s list candidate words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: L U I T _  → word would be L U I T ? but we need a valid 5-letter English word. Possibilities: “LUITZ” (not a word), “LUIT” is 4 letters. None.

Pattern 1: _ U I T L → word would be ? U I T L. Needs a valid consonant in pos 1. Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Z. “BUITL” not a word. “CUILT” not a word. “DUILT” not a word. “FUILT” not a word. “GUILT” – yes, that’s a word.

Pattern 2: _ U I L T → word would be ? U I L T. Check consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Z. “BUILT” – yes, but we already ruled out B (not yet ruled out! B is allowed). However, B is still allowed, but we need to see if it conflicts with any feedback. From past feedback, B has not appeared, so it’s allowed.

Between “GUILT” and “BUILT”, both fit. Let’s check which has the highest likelihood. Both are valid. Let’s pick “GUILT” since it contains G, which hasn’t been tested yet.

Verify:
- G: allowed (not in any ruled-out letters)
- U: position 2 (✓)
- I: position 3 (✓)
- L: position 4 (not in position 3, ok)
- T: position 5 (not in position 1 or 4, ok)

Thus, “GUILT” satisfies all constraints.
