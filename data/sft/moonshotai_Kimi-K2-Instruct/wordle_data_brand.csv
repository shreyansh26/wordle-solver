For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good starting word in Wordle strategy is one that contains frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives me coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information I can gain from the feedback. If any of these letters are in the word, the feedback will immediately show me which ones and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Position 2 is definitely R.
- The word contains an A somewhere after position 1.
- The letters O, S, E are ruled out.

Good next letters to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D and perhaps another vowel like I or U. Since A is required and R is fixed, let’s try a structure like _ R _ _ _ or _ _ R _ _ etc.

A good next guess is “TRAIN”:
- It places A in position 3 (different from position 1 in AROSE), checking if A is there.
- It tests T, I, N, which are all common letters.
- It keeps R in position 2, which we know is correct.
- It avoids O, S, E, which we know are not in the word.

- Letters still possible: A (already placed), R (already placed), N (must be in 1, 4), plus other unused common letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

- Three more letters that haven’t been ruled out.

From GRAND we just learned:
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- R is still correct at position 2 (✓)
- A is still correct at position 3 (✓)
- N moved from position 4 to position 4 – so N is in fact correct at position 4 (✓)
- D is now correct at position 5 (✓)

So the word now looks like: _ R A N D

The only missing letter is position 1.  
Letters already eliminated include: G, T, O, S, E, I.

Still-untested common consonants for position 1: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Among these, “B” is very common as a starting consonant before R.  
Let’s check whether “BRAND” fits all constraints:

- B has not been used before.
- R, A, N, D already confirmed for positions 2-5.
- “BRAND” is a valid 5-letter English word.

That would make the full word BRAND.
