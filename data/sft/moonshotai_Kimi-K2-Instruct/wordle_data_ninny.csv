Since this is the first guess with no feedback to guide me, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and represents vowels that appear in many English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
- N  (second letter in UNTIL, so N is somewhere else)
- I  (fourth letter in UNTIL, so I is somewhere else)

So N and I must appear, but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: D, P, M, H, G, B, C, Y, F, V, K, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N and I exactly once each (so we can place them in new positions).
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L).
- Uses other allowed letters from the remaining pool.

A quick scan gives “PINCH”:
- P, I, N, C, H
- Contains N and I.
- Uses C and H, which haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids every eliminated letter.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and represents vowels that appear in many English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates many common letters, so I must choose a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E.

Next most frequent letters in English are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.

I want 5 distinct letters from the remaining pool, avoiding the eliminated ones.  
A good choice is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- It tests two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
- N  (second letter in UNTIL, so N is somewhere else)
- I  (fourth letter in UNTIL, so I is somewhere else)

So N and I must appear, but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: D, P, M, H, G, B, C, Y, F, V, K, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N and I exactly once each (so we can place them in new positions).
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L).
- Uses other allowed letters from the remaining pool.

A quick scan gives “PINCH”:
- P, I, N, C, H
- Contains N and I.
- Uses C and H, which haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids every eliminated letter.

Let’s try PINCH.

I (3rd position)  
N (4th position)

So the pattern is: _ _ I N _

Remaining unused, still-allowed letters (from the common English pool) are:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5.  
We also want to avoid repeating any already-eliminated letters.

Trying plausible combinations:

- B I N D  
- M I N D  
- F I N D  
- W I N D  
- V I N D  

""MIND"" seems like a strong candidate:

The last guess “MIND” has only four letters, so it’s invalid.

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  \nThat eliminates many common letters, so I must choose a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E.\n\nNext most frequent letters in English are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.\n\nI want 5 distinct letters from the remaining pool, avoiding the eliminated ones.  \nA good choice is ""UNTIL"" (U, N, T, I, L).  \n- All letters are still allowed.  \n- It tests two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we now know:\n\nLetters NOT in the word:\nA, R, O, S, E, U, T, L\n\nLetters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:\n- N  (second letter in UNTIL, so N is somewhere else)\n- I  (fourth letter in UNTIL, so I is somewhere else)\n\nSo N and I must appear, but not in positions 2 and 4, respectively.\n\nRemaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: D, P, M, H, G, B, C, Y, F, V, K, etc.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that:\n- Uses N and I exactly once each (so we can place them in new positions).\n- Avoids all eliminated letters (A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L).\n- Uses other allowed letters from the remaining pool.\n\nA quick scan gives “PINCH”:\n- P, I, N, C, H\n- Contains N and I.\n- Uses C and H, which haven’t been tested yet.\n- Avoids every eliminated letter.\n\nLet’s try PINCH.\n\n<guess>PINCH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n\nLetters NOT in the word:  \nA, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, P, C, H\n\nLetters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions:  \nI (3rd position)  \nN (4th position)\n\nSo the pattern is: _ _ I N _\n\nRemaining unused, still-allowed letters (from the common English pool) are:  \nB, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5.  \nWe also want to avoid repeating any already-eliminated letters.\n\nTrying plausible combinations:\n\n- B I N D  \n- M I N D  \n- F I N D  \n- W I N D  \n- V I N D  \n\n""MIND"" seems like a strong candidate:  \n- M and D are both unused common letters.  \n- The pattern _ _ I N D matches our constraints.  \n\nLet\'s go with ""MIND"".\n\n<guess>MIND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: MIND -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The last guess “MIND” has only four letters, so it’s invalid.  \nI must supply a five-letter word that:\n\n- keeps the now-fixed letters I (3rd) and N (4th),  \n- uses only letters not yet eliminated:  \n  allowed set = {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus any still-allowed vowels (but we have only I left).  \n\nThe pattern is _ _ I N _.  \nLet’s list common five-letter words fitting this pattern with remaining letters:\n\nB I N D _ → BINDY?  \nB I N G _ → BING_, but B I N G E uses an E (eliminated).  \nF I N D → only four letters.  \nW I N D → only four letters.  \nK I N D → only four letters.  \nG I N D → “gind” not a word.  \n\nA valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ I N _ with only uneliminated letters is “BINDI” (a forehead dot).  \nAll its letters (B, I, N, D, I) are either confirmed (I, N) or still allowed (B, D) and the word is five letters long.\n\n<guess>BINDI</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: MIND -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 5: BINDI -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) N(✓) D(x) I(-)\n'}]","<think>
From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated):
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, P, C, H, B, D

Letters KNOWN to be in the word and now fixed in position:
I (3rd position)
N (4th position)

Current pattern: _ _ I N _

Remaining still-allowed letters (never eliminated):  
F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5, chosen from that list, and they must form a valid English 5-letter word.

Try consonant pairs that form real words:

F _ _ _ _  → F I N _ _  → F I N C H (C eliminated)  
F I N K Y  – “finky” is slang, but “FINK” alone is four letters.  
G I N _ _  → G I N G E (E eliminated)  
K I N _ _  → K I N K Y – valid 5-letter word, letters K, I, N, K, Y.  
K and Y are still allowed.

K I N K Y fits pattern _ _ I N _ if we allow K repeated.  
Another candidate: W I N K Y (W, I, N, K, Y) – also valid.  
M I N K Y – likewise.  
Among these, “KINKY” is the most common English word.

Let’s go with KINKY.
