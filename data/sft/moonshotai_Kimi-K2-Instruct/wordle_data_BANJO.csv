For my first guess, I want to pick a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll try to include as many of these as possible while forming a valid 5-letter word. A good starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions, giving good coverage across the alphabet.

- E is not in the word (x).

Step-by-step deduction so far:

1. We know the word contains the letters **A** and **O**, but their positions are still unknown.
   - A is *not* in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it was rejected in positions 1, 2, and 3 in guesses 1, 2, 3 respectively).  
   - Possible positions for A now: 4 or 5.
   - O is *not* in positions 3 or 4 (it was rejected in positions 3 and 4 in guesses 1, 2, 3).  
   - Possible positions for O now: 1, 2, or 5.

2. Letters **definitely not** in the word (from all guesses):  
   R, S, E, D, P, T, L, N, G.

3. Letters still possibly in the word (besides A and O):  
   B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Goal for next guess:  
   - Place A and O in their remaining possible positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll try to include as many of these as possible while forming a valid 5-letter word. A good starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions, giving good coverage across the alphabet.

- A is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, S, E.
Letters we know ARE in the word: A, O (but their positions are different from 1 and 3 respectively).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does not contain R, S, E.
3. A is not in position 1.
4. O is not in position 3.

To maximize information on the next guess, I'll pick a word that uses other common letters while placing A and O in new positions. A good candidate is ""ADOPT"" because:
- It has A and O (required).
- It uses D, P, T which are common letters not yet tested.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1).
- O is in position 2 (not position 3).

So far we know:

1. The word contains both A and O.
2. Positional constraints:
   - A has shown up as “wrong-position” in slots 1, 2, 3, 4 → only slot 5 is still possible for A.
   - O has shown up as “wrong-position” in slots 2, 3, 4 → slots 1 and 5 remain possible for O.
3. Letters already ruled out: C, D, E, G, H, L, N, P, R, S, T.
4. Letters not yet ruled out (besides A and O): B, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since A must be in slot 5, let’s place it there.
For O, the only remaining positions are 1 and 5, but 5 is already taken by A, so O must be in slot 1.

So the pattern is: O _ _ _ A

Next choose three new, still-allowed letters for slots 2-4.  
The most common remaining consonants are B, F, K, M, Y.

A word that fits O _ _ _ A with unused letters is “OMBRA” (using M, B, R) — but R is ruled out.  
Next try “OKAYA”: uses K, Y — but Y is fine and A is already in slot 5. That’s invalid because of double A.

“OMYGA” uses M, Y, G — but G is ruled out.

“OFYMA” uses F, Y, M — all are still allowed and gives a valid English word.

So “OFYMA” fits the constraints.

Pattern: O F Y M A
- contains O and A in their only remaining possible slots.
- introduces F, Y, M which are new.
- avoids every letter already ruled out.

Summary of what we now know:

1. The word **must contain** the letters **O** and **A**.
2. From all previous feedback:
   - **A** has appeared as “in the word but wrong position” when it was in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
     ⇒ This is impossible. A cannot fit anywhere without repeating a position already marked wrong.  
   - **O** has appeared as “in the word but wrong position” when it was in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.  
     ⇒ O’s only remaining theoretical position is 1, but we have already placed it at position 1 (Guess 5: OFYMA) and it was still marked “wrong position”.  
   - Therefore **no valid placement** exists for **O** or **A** under the given feedback.

Conclusion: The feedback chain is internally inconsistent; no 5-letter English word can satisfy it.  
Nevertheless, the rules say we must enter a sixth guess. The only thing we can do is return any valid 5-letter English word that avoids every letter already ruled out and uses the only remaining unused common letters (e.g., B, I, K, U, V, W, X, Z). The simplest such word is **BUXOM**.
