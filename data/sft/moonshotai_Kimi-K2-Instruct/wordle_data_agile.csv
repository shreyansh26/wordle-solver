For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Final letter is E (✓ in position 5).
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, A (because both were marked “-” in earlier guesses).
- Letters that have been eliminated: S, T, C, R, N.
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback).
- A cannot be in position 3 (from SLATE) or position 2 (from CRANE), so A must be in position 1 or 4.
- We still need three letters (positions 1-4, excluding what we know).  Available, untested common letters: B, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Possible skeletons of the word:
   A _ _ _ E   (A in position 1)
   _ _ _ A E   (A in position 4)

We also know L must fit somewhere.  Possibilities:
   A L _ _ E   – but L can’t be in position 2, so this is invalid.
   A _ L _ E
   A _ _ L E   – but then A is in 1 and L in 4, leaving two unknown letters.
   _ _ _ A E means positions 1,2,3 need L plus two new letters.

Let’s explore the pattern _ _ _ A E because that leaves positions 1,2,3 to fit L and two other allowed letters.  Good untested letters: B, D, M, P, etc.  Common combinations might include:
   M A L E (but A would be in 2, which is already excluded)
   B L A D E (but it’s 5 letters and ends with E, yet A is in 3, which is disallowed)
   B L A _ E – still A in 3 → invalid.

Wait, let’s be systematic:

Possible word positions:
   1 2 3 4 5
   ? ? ? ? E

A must be in 1 or 4.
L must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: A in 1
   A _ _ _ E
   L must be in 3 or 4.
   - If L in 3: A _ L _ E → blanks 2,4 need two new consonants.
     Possible: A B L D E, A B L M E, etc., but these must be real 5-letter words.
     “ABLED” – not common.
     “ALBEE” – proper noun, likely invalid.
     “ABLER” – ends with R (eliminated).
     “AGLEE” – uncommon.
   - If L in 4: A _ _ L E → blanks 2,3.  Common words?
     “ANGLE” – uses N (eliminated).
     “AMPLE” – uses P (new), M (new), L (fits), E (good).
     “AMPLE” seems real and fits all constraints.

Case 2: A in 4
   _ _ _ A E
   L must be in 1 or 2 or 3.  (Cannot be 2 from SLATE feedback.)
   So L in 1 or 3.
   - L _ _ A E:  “LEAVE” – uses V, V not yet tested, but E is in 5, A in 4, L in 1.  All letters valid so far.
   - _ _ L A E:  “FLAME” – but F not tested; also A is in 4, L in 3, E in 5.  However, F not yet ruled out.

Between “AMPLE” (Case 1) and “LEAVE” (Case 2), both fit rules.  Let’s pick “AMPLE” because it tests M and P, two new consonants.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E
- Contains L somewhere other than slot 2
- Contains A somewhere other than slot 3
- Does NOT contain S or T
- Has 5 letters total

Good next guesses should:
- Keep the E fixed in position 5

- Use the known letters L and A in new positions

A balanced word that does this is “CRANE” because:

- The L must still be placed elsewhere; for now we’ll look for more info with new consonants.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:
- Final letter is E (✓ in position 5).
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, A (because both were marked “-” in earlier guesses).
- Letters that have been eliminated: S, T, C, R, N.
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback).
- A cannot be in position 3 (from SLATE) or position 2 (from CRANE), so A must be in position 1 or 4.
- We still need three letters (positions 1-4, excluding what we know).  Available, untested common letters: B, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Possible skeletons of the word:
   A _ _ _ E   (A in position 1)
   _ _ _ A E   (A in position 4)

We also know L must fit somewhere.  Possibilities:
   A L _ _ E   – but L can’t be in position 2, so this is invalid.
   A _ L _ E
   A _ _ L E   – but then A is in 1 and L in 4, leaving two unknown letters.
   _ _ _ A E means positions 1,2,3 need L plus two new letters.

Let’s explore the pattern _ _ _ A E because that leaves positions 1,2,3 to fit L and two other allowed letters.  Good untested letters: B, D, M, P, etc.  Common combinations might include:
   M A L E (but A would be in 2, which is already excluded)
   B L A D E (but it’s 5 letters and ends with E, yet A is in 3, which is disallowed)
   B L A _ E – still A in 3 → invalid.

Wait, let’s be systematic:

Possible word positions:
   1 2 3 4 5
   ? ? ? ? E

A must be in 1 or 4.
L must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: A in 1
   A _ _ _ E
   L must be in 3 or 4.
   - If L in 3: A _ L _ E → blanks 2,4 need two new consonants.
     Possible: A B L D E, A B L M E, etc., but these must be real 5-letter words.
     “ABLED” – not common.
     “ALBEE” – proper noun, likely invalid.
     “ABLER” – ends with R (eliminated).
     “AGLEE” – uncommon.
   - If L in 4: A _ _ L E → blanks 2,3.  Common words?
     “ANGLE” – uses N (eliminated).
     “AMPLE” – uses P (new), M (new), L (fits), E (good).
     “AMPLE” seems real and fits all constraints.

Case 2: A in 4
   _ _ _ A E
   L must be in 1 or 2 or 3.  (Cannot be 2 from SLATE feedback.)
   So L in 1 or 3.
   - L _ _ A E:  “LEAVE” – uses V, V not yet tested, but E is in 5, A in 4, L in 1.  All letters valid so far.
   - _ _ L A E:  “FLAME” – but F not tested; also A is in 4, L in 3, E in 5.  However, F not yet ruled out.

Between “AMPLE” (Case 1) and “LEAVE” (Case 2), both fit rules.  Let’s pick “AMPLE” because it tests M and P, two new consonants.

Check constraints for AMPLE:
   A in position 1 (allowed)
   M new
   P new
   L in position 4 (allowed)
   E in position 5 ✓
   No eliminated letters (S,T,C,R,N) appear.  Good.

So the word must be of the form:

We have positions 2 and 3 still unknown, and we know:
- Cannot use any of the already-eliminated letters: S, T, C, R, N, M, P.
- Letters already confirmed in the word: A, L, E.  No repeats needed.
- Common remaining letters we haven’t tested yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants (or vowels) for positions 2 and 3, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in “L E” and starting with “A”.

Possible common letters:
B, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words starting with A and ending in LE:
- ANGLE – but N is eliminated.
- APPLE – P is eliminated.
- ADDLE – uses D twice?  No, D and D.  But A D D L E – real word.
- AUGLE – not a word.
- AWHLE – not valid.
- AXILE – uses X, I, L, E.  X not tested yet.
- AGILE – uses G, I.  G and I are new, L and E confirmed.  A G I L E – valid word.

AGILE fits all constraints:
- A is correct in position 1.
- G and I are new letters, not yet ruled out.
- L is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.
- No eliminated letters (S, T, C, R, N, M, P) appear.

Therefore, AGILE is a valid next guess.
