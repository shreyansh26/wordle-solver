For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- STARE - uses very common letters (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE - another excellent choice with common consonants
- SLATE - covers many vowels and common consonants
- ARISE - good vowel coverage plus common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
2. It has two very common consonants (R, S)
3. It covers different positions for common letters
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good information about which vowels are in the word and where they might be positioned, along with the consonants R and S.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are **not** in the word at all (x).
- O **is** in the word, but not at position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Definitely contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd spot.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

That leaves us with consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels I, U (plus O, which we already know is present).

Since we have no other positional or letter information, our next guess should:
1. Reinforce the O in a new position.
2. Try new high-frequency consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid the eliminated letters (A, R, S, E).

A strong choice is “POINT” because:
- It moves O to position 2 (different from the eliminated 3rd position).
- It uses common letters P, I, N, T, none of which have been ruled out.
- It has a good mix of consonants and vowels.

I(-)  – I is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.  
N(-)  – N is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.  
T(-)  – T is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

- Starts with P.
- Contains O, I, N, T exactly once each.
- O ≠ 2, I ≠ 3, N ≠ 4, T ≠ 5.
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E.

We have five letters (P, O, I, N, T) to place under these constraints.  
Possible valid arrangements:

1. P _ O _ _ (O cannot be 2, so 3 is fine).
2. P _ _ O _ (O in 4).
3. P _ _ _ O (O in 5).

For each we must place I, N, T in the remaining spots while respecting their exclusions.

Let’s look at the simplest: put O in position 3.

P _ O _ _

Remaining positions 2,4,5 need I, N, T with:
- I ≠ 3 (already satisfied),  
- N ≠ 4,  
- T ≠ 5.

Possible permutations of I,N,T:
- I N T → N would be 4 (invalid).  
- I T N → T would be 4, N would be 5 (valid).  
- N I T → T would be 5 (invalid).  
- N T I → T would be 4, I would be 5 (valid: P N O T I).  
- T I N → T would be 2, I would be 4, N would be 5 (valid: P T O I N).  
- T N I → T would be 2, N would be 4 (invalid).

Valid full words:
- P I O T N  
- P N O T I  
- P T O I N  

All three are legitimate English words.

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

It contains three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common\n2. It has two very common consonants (R, S)\n3. It covers different positions for common letters\n4.

Let’s extract what we now know:

Letters we have:
P ✓ at 1  
I ✓ at 2  
T is in the word but NOT at 3  
O is in the word but NOT at 4  
N is in the word but NOT at 5  

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with PI  
- contains the remaining letters O, N, T once each  
- places O somewhere other than 4  
- places T somewhere other than 3  
- places N somewhere other than 5  

The skeleton so far: P I _ _ _

Unused positions: 3, 4, 5  
Letters to place: O, N, T

Constraints:
- T ≠ 3  
- O ≠ 4  
- N ≠ 5  

Possible permutations of O,N,T across positions 3,4,5:

1. O N T → T would be at 5 (valid), O at 3 (valid), N at 4 (valid) → PINOT – no, that would be P I N O T, but N is at 4 (allowed) and O at 3 (allowed).  
Wait, let’s list every permutation of O,N,T that satisfies the constraints:

Possible assignments:
- 3 4 5
- O N T  → O at 3 (allowed), N at 4 (allowed), T at 5 (allowed) → P I O N T
- O T N  → O at 3, T at 4, N at 5 (invalid because N cannot be 5)
- N O T  → N at 3, O at 4 (invalid because O cannot be 4)
- N T O  → N at 3, T at 4, O at 5 (valid) → P I N T O
- T O N  → T at 3 (invalid, T cannot be 3)
- T N O  → T at 3 (invalid)

So only two valid full words:
- P I O N T  
- P I N T O  

Both are real English words. Between them, let’s pick PINTO (a common word).
