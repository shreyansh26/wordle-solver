For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. I'll choose a word that uses some of these letters to maximize the information gain. A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help determine which of these letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ E

We also know:
- A exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
- O and S are completely ruled out.

To test new letters and reposition A, a good next guess might be:
- CRANE: tests C, N, and repositions A to the first letter (but A can't be in position 1 from A(-), so bad).
- FREAK: tests F and K, repositions A to 4th.
- GRATE: tests G and T, repositions A to 3rd.

Among these, GRATE seems good as it tests common letters G and T and moves A to position 3.

But looking at the pattern _R__E, another approach is to keep R in 2nd and E in 5th, and place A in 3rd or 4th. Trying DRAPE: tests D and P, places A in 3rd.

Actually, TRACE is better: tests T, C, and places A in 3rd. The pattern is _RACE, but we know E is in 5th, so _R_AE is possible. Wait no, the pattern is _R__E with A somewhere not first.

Best is to choose a word that fits _R__E and includes A in a different spot. Let's try DRAPE: D R A P E - fits _R_AE which matches the pattern and moves A to 3rd.

But let's think of simpler: BRAVE - B R A V E - fits _R_AE, tests B and V.

However, we need to maximize new letter tests. CRANE is invalid because A can't be first. 

Another good choice is PRIDE: P R I D E - fits _R__E, tests P, I, D.

But PRIDE doesn't include A. 

BRACE: B R A C E - fits _R_AE, tests B, C.

Actually, the simplest is FRAME: F R A M E - fits _R_AE, tests F, M.

This seems balanced.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ E

We also know:
- A exists somewhere, but not in position 1.
- O and S are completely ruled out.

To test new letters and reposition A, a good next guess might be:
- CRANE: tests C, N, and repositions A to the first letter (but A can't be in position 1 from A(-), so bad).
- FREAK: tests F and K, repositions A to 4th.
- GRATE: tests G and T, repositions A to 3rd.

Among these, GRATE seems good as it tests common letters G and T and moves A to position 3.

But looking at the pattern _R__E, another approach is to keep R in 2nd and E in 5th, and place A in 3rd or 4th. Trying DRAPE: tests D and P, places A in 3rd.

Actually, TRACE is better: tests T, C, and places A in 3rd. The pattern is _RACE, but we know E is in 5th, so _R_AE is possible. Wait no, the pattern is _R__E with A somewhere not first.

Best is to choose a word that fits _R__E and includes A in a different spot. Let's try DRAPE: D R A P E - fits _R_AE which matches the pattern and moves A to 3rd.

But let's think of simpler: BRAVE - B R A V E - fits _R_AE, tests B and V.

However, we need to maximize new letter tests. CRANE is invalid because A can't be first. 

Another good choice is PRIDE: P R I D E - fits _R__E, tests P, I, D.

But PRIDE doesn't include A. 

BRACE: B R A C E - fits _R_AE, tests B, C.

Actually, the simplest is FRAME: F R A M E - fits _R_AE, tests F, M.

This seems balanced.

Among these, CRANE seems good as it tests C and N which are common.

Among these, GRADE tests G and D; GRATE tests G and T.  
TRACE is dead, so let's go with GRADE to check G and D.

We need a 5-letter word that starts GRA and ends with E, using one of the remaining letters for the 4th slot.  
Possible words:
