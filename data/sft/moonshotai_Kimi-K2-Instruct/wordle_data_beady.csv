For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test what letters might be in the secret word.

From the first guess “AROSE” we learned:

- A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is NOT in the word  
- O is NOT in the word  
- S is NOT in the word  
- E is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:
- Letters to keep: A, E  
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S  

Next, I want to test new common consonants like T, N, L, C, D and another vowel (I, U) while placing A and/or E in fresh positions.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It re-uses A and E (both known to be somewhere in the word).  
- It introduces new letters (L, I, N) none of which are ruled out.  
- The positions of A and E are different from the first guess.

From the two guesses so far we have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, I, N

The positions we still need to test for A are 2, 3, 4, 5 (since A has already been tried in position 1 twice).  
The positions we still need to test for E are 1, 2, 3, 4 (since E has been tried in positions 5 and 5 again).

I now want to pick a word that:
- Only uses letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., avoids R O S L I N).  
- Uses A and E in new positions.  
- Introduces three new high-frequency consonants.

A good candidate is “GATED”:
- Uses G, T, D – none of which have been tested yet.

- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We need three more consonants, none of which are the 9 letters already ruled out.  
Popular consonants still unused: C, B, M, P, F, K, H, etc.

I’ll build a word that uses A and E in their still-possible slots, while introducing three new consonants.

Candidate positions:
If A = 3, then E could be 1 or 2  
If A = 5, then E could be 1, 2, or 3  

Let me try:  
E in position 1, A in position 3, and three new consonants in positions 2, 4, 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test what letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess “AROSE” we learned:

- A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is NOT in the word  
- O is NOT in the word  
- S is NOT in the word  
- E is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:
- Letters to keep: A, E  
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S  

Next, I want to test new common consonants like T, N, L, C, D and another vowel (I, U) while placing A and/or E in fresh positions.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It re-uses A and E (both known to be somewhere in the word).  
- It introduces new letters (L, I, N) none of which are ruled out.  
- The positions of A and E are different from the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we have:

Letters that are in the secret word (position unknown): A, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, I, N  

So the secret word is made up of A and E plus three other letters that we have not tested yet from the remaining common alphabet: T, D, G, C, M, P, U, B, F, K, etc.  
The positions we still need to test for A are 2, 3, 4, 5 (since A has already been tried in position 1 twice).  
The positions we still need to test for E are 1, 2, 3, 4 (since E has been tried in positions 5 and 5 again).

I now want to pick a word that:
- Only uses letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., avoids R O S L I N).  
- Uses A and E in new positions.  
- Introduces three new high-frequency consonants.

A good candidate is “GATED”:
- Uses G, T, D – none of which have been tested yet.  
- Puts A in position 2 (new slot).  
- Puts E in position 4 (new slot).

We now have:

- Letters confirmed to be in the word AND in the correct spot:

  – E in position 2 ✓

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
  – R, O, S, L, I, N, G, T, D, C, H

So the pattern so far is: B E A _ _

The only two positions still open are the 4th and 5th letters.  
Letters that have not been tested yet (and are thus still possible) include:
F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any remaining vowels, but the only unused vowel is U (since A, E are fixed; I and O are out).

With so many consonants left, I’ll pick the single most common one that hasn’t been played: M.

Let me try “BEAM_”.  
The only valid 5-letter English word that starts “BEAM” and uses an allowed letter is “BEAMY” (Y is still allowed).  
But let’s also consider “BEAMS” → S is already ruled out.

Another candidate: “BEAMY” is valid (unless Y is later ruled out).  
Another quick check: “BEAK_” → K is allowed, giving “BEAKS” (S is ruled out) or “BEAKY”.

But since we have only two blanks and no information yet for the 4th and 5th letters, a better strategy is to pick a word that places the highest-probability consonants in those two spots.  
The most common remaining consonants are M and P.

Valid English words that fit: “BEAMP” does not exist.  
“BEAMY” is valid.  
“BEAKY” is valid.  
“BEAKS” is invalid (S eliminated).  
“BEAKY” uses Y, which is still allowed.

Let me choose “BEAKY” because:
- K and Y are both untested and still possible.  
- It’s a real word.

(If I prefer M and another consonant, “BEAMY” is equally valid; I’ll choose BEAMY.)

Either BEAMY or BEAKY will give maximal information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to test what letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess “AROSE” we learned:

- A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is NOT in the word  
- O is NOT in the word  
- S is NOT in the word  
- E is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:
- Letters to keep: A, E  
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S  

Next, I want to test new common consonants like T, N, L, C, D and another vowel (I, U) while placing A and/or E in fresh positions.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It re-uses A and E (both known to be somewhere in the word).  
- It introduces new letters (L, I, N) none of which are ruled out.  
- The positions of A and E are different from the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we have:

Letters that are in the secret word (position unknown): A, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, I, N  

So the secret word is made up of A and E plus three other letters that we have not tested yet from the remaining common alphabet: T, D, G, C, M, P, U, B, F, K, etc.  
The positions we still need to test for A are 2, 3, 4, 5 (since A has already been tried in position 1 twice).  
The positions we still need to test for E are 1, 2, 3, 4 (since E has been tried in positions 5 and 5 again).

I now want to pick a word that:
- Only uses letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., avoids R O S L I N).  
- Uses A and E in new positions.  
- Introduces three new high-frequency consonants.

A good candidate is “GATED”:
- Uses G, T, D – none of which have been tested yet.  
- Puts A in position 2 (new slot).  
- Puts E in position 4 (new slot).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters in the word: A, E  
Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, I, N, G, T, D  

That leaves the untested (and still possible) consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions already eliminated for each known letter:
- A: positions 1 (twice), 2  
- E: positions 4 (twice), 5 (twice)

Thus:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is already taken by E in guess 3, so A is in 3 or 5).  
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We need three more consonants, none of which are the 9 letters already ruled out.  
Popular consonants still unused: C, B, M, P, F, K, H, etc.

I’ll build a word that uses A and E in their still-possible slots, while introducing three new consonants.

Candidate positions:
If A = 3, then E could be 1 or 2  
If A = 5, then E could be 1, 2, or 3  

Let me try:  
E in position 1, A in position 3, and three new consonants in positions 2, 4, 5.  
Choose common but untested consonants: B, C, M.

Word: E B A C M → EBACM (not a valid word).  
Word: E C A B M → ECABM (invalid).  
Word: E M A C K → EMACK (invalid).

Word: C A B E M → CABEM (invalid).

Word: E C H A K → ECHAK (invalid).  
Word: E M A C K → EMACK (invalid).  
Word: E M A C K → already invalid.  

Try E = 2, A = 5, consonants in 1,3,4:  
Word: C E B A M → CEBAM (invalid).  
Word: M E C A B → MECAB (invalid).  
Word: B E C A M → BECAM (invalid).  

Try E = 3, A = 5, consonants in 1,2,4:  
Word: C A E M B → CAEMB (invalid).  
Word: M A C E B → MACEB (invalid).  
Word: B A C E M → BACEM (invalid).  

I need a valid English word. Let’s look for common patterns and cross-check the remaining letters:

Possible consonants: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid pattern is: E A _ _ _  
We need consonants in positions 3,4,5 that have not been used.  
Try: E A C H _ → invalid.  
Try: E A C H Y → invalid.  
Try: E A C H O → O is eliminated.  
Try: E A C H U → invalid.  
Try: E A C H K → invalid.  

Try: E A C K _ → invalid.  
Try: E A C K Y → invalid.  

Try: E A _ C _

Try: E A B C K → invalid.  
Try: E A M C K → invalid.  

Try: E A C H _  
No valid word.  

Try: E A C H _  
No valid word.  

Try: E A _ _ _  
Try: E A C H E → E is already known, but duplicate E is allowed.  
E A C H E → invalid.  

Try: E A C H O → O is eliminated.  

Try: _ E A _ _  
Positions: 1, 2, 3  
Let’s try: C E A S E → S is eliminated.  
B E A C H → B, E, A, C, H – all allowed and B, C, H are new.  
Word: BEACH.

Check letters in BEACH:
B – not tested  
E – known to be in word  
A – known to be in word  
C – not tested  
H – not tested

Valid word, no eliminated letters, uses A and E in new positions (A in 3, E in 2), and introduces three fresh consonants.

Thus, my next guess is BEACH.

With so many consonants left, I’ll pick the single most common one that hasn’t been played: M.

Let me try “BEAM_”.  
The only valid 5-letter English word that starts “BEAM” and uses an allowed letter is “BEAMY” (Y is still allowed).  
But let’s also consider “BEAMS” → S is already ruled out.

Another candidate: “BEAMY” is valid (unless Y is later ruled out).  
Another quick check: “BEAK_” → K is allowed, giving “BEAKS” (S is ruled out) or “BEAKY”.

But since we have only two blanks and no information yet for the 4th and 5th letters, a better strategy is to pick a word that places the highest-probability consonants in those two spots.

- It’s a real word.

(If I prefer M and another consonant, “BEAMY” is equally valid; I’ll choose BEAMY.)

Either BEAMY or BEAKY will give maximal information.

From all feedback so far we know:

- Fixed letters:
  – B in position 1 ✓
  – E in position 2 ✓
  – A in position 3 ✓
  – Y in position 5 ✓

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
  R, O, S, L, I, N, G, T, D, C, H, M

So the secret word pattern is:
B E A _ Y

Only the 4th letter is still unknown, and the consonants/vowels still allowed are:
F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet eliminated, but those are the main ones left).

Looking at real 5-letter English words that match B E A _ Y, the only common valid possibilities are:

BEAKY  (already tried, and ruled out because K was in the 4th spot with no ✓, but we don’t yet know K’s status)  
BEACH  (ruled out by previous feedback)  
BEAMY  (just tried, M ruled out)  
BEADY  (D already ruled out)  
BEAKY  (already tried)  
BEAGY  (not a word)  
BEAPY  (not a word)  
BEAFY  (not a word)  
BEAKY  (already tried)  
BEANY  (N ruled out)  
BEARY  (R ruled out)  

Actually, the only remaining valid English word that fits the pattern B E A _ Y and uses only letters that have not been ruled out is:

B E A K Y

But we already tried BEAKY (it was rejected in feedback). No, wait — in the last guess we tried BEAMY, not BEAKY. BEAKY has not been guessed yet.

Letters in BEAKY:
B ✓ (already fixed)
E ✓ (already fixed)
A ✓ (already fixed)
K (new, untested)
Y ✓ (already fixed)

Thus, BEAKY is the only possible word that fits all constraints. Since we have only one slot left and only one common letter (K) not yet eliminated in that slot, we should guess it.

Indeed, checking the dictionary, “BEAKY” is a valid word (e.g., slang for having a beak-like nose or shape).

Therefore, the next (and logically final) guess is BEAKY.
