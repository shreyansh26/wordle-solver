For the first guess, the strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good opening words typically contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ADIEU
- STARE

Looking at these, I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- Doesn't repeat any letters
- Uses letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Pos 2: A (locked)
Pos 3: cannot be R (from feedback)
Pos 4: cannot be L (from feedback)

- E must go in 3 or 4
- R must go in 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2,3)

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions from ALTER’s feedback:
- T is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 5 (✓)

So the word pattern is: _ _ T E R

Letters still allowed but whose exact positions aren’t yet locked:
- A must be in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback it was misplaced in both ARISE and ALTER). However, position 3 is already T, so this implies A must be in position 1 or 2, but earlier feedback said A was misplaced in position 1 (ARISE) and also misplaced in position 2 (EARLY had A in 2 but feedback said A was ✓ in position 2, while ALTER had A in 1 and feedback was A(-)). This seems conflicting—let’s re-examine:

Reconstructing:
- In ARISE: A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1
- In EARLY: A(✓) meant A is in position 2
- In ALTER: A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1, which aligns since A is known to be in 2 from EARLY

Thus:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 5 (✓)

So the word is: _ A T E R

Now we just need to find the first letter. From previous feedback:
- Letters ruled out: I, S, Y
- Letters already used and confirmed: A, T, E, R
- L was tried in EARLY and ALTER, but feedback was L(-), meaning L is in the word but misplaced. Since the only remaining position is 1, L must be in position 1.

Thus, the word is L A T E R.

Let’s verify:
- L in 1: not yet ruled out
- A in 2: confirmed
- T in 3: confirmed
- E in 4: confirmed
- R in 5: confirmed
- No conflicts with previous feedback.
