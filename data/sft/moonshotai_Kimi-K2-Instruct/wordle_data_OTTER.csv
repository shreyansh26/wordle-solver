For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Traditional strong opening words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover frequently used consonants and multiple vowels.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words:
- S is very common in starting positions
- L, T are frequent consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

   ⇒ No H, M.

Combining these constraints:

- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, H, M  
- Required letters: T (somewhere except positions 1 or 4) and E (somewhere except positions 3 or 5)  
- Five-letter word, no repeated letters unless necessary.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

We also want to test new common consonants. Good ones left: R, N, C, D, B, G, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me construct a word that:
- Puts T in a new allowed spot (say position 2)  
- Puts E in a new allowed spot (say position 4)  
- Introduces two fresh consonants and possibly one more vowel  

Candidate: W R I T E – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) – no.  
Try: R E C T O – E in 2, T in 4 – but T cannot be in 4 (from SLATE feedback).  
Try: C R E T E – would have E twice and T in 4 (both bad).  
Try: E R R O T – invalid English word.  
Try: B E N T O – T in 4 again.  
Try: R E N T E – T in 4 again.  
Try: P E T R O – T in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), new letters P, R, O. No forbidden letters (S,L,A,H,M).  

PETRO is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “relating to petroleum or rock/oil”.

Let’s check it meets all constraints:  
- Contains T (position 3 – not 1 or 4) and E (position 2 – not 3,5).

From the three guesses so far:

1. SLATE → T and E are both in the word but in wrong positions (T ≠ pos 4, E ≠ pos 5).  
2. THEME → T ≠ pos 1, E ≠ pos 3 or 5.  
3. PETRO → T is now confirmed in position 3 (✓), E is still in the word but not in position 2, R is in the word but not in position 4, O is in the word but not in position 5.

Collecting everything:

- Fixed: T in position 3.  
- Required letters still somewhere: E and R.  
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, H, M, P.  
- Allowed positions:  
  – E can be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2, 3, 5).  
  – R can be 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3, 4).  

We need two more letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, I, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Aiming for common consonants and an easy vowel, let’s try:

- Put E in position 1 (first letter).  
- Put R in position 5 (last letter).  
- Fill positions 2 and 4 with new consonants, ensuring no repeats and no banned letters.

Candidate: E _ T _ R  
Good consonants to test: C, N, D.  
Let’s use C and N: E C T N R → valid word “ENTER” – but N is repeated with T already placed, and “ENTER” puts E in pos 1, N in 2, T pos 3, E in 4, R in 5. That would have E twice (acceptable) and use N.  
But we already know E cannot be in position 4 (from THEME feedback). So “ENTER” is invalid because E appears in position 4 which is disallowed.

Try: E D I T R → invalid (T already fixed in 3).  
Try: E V I T N → invalid (T already fixed).  
Try: E R I T C → invalid (R in 2 which is allowed, but T already fixed).

- 1: E (allowed)  
- 2: any allowed consonant

E N T E R – has E twice, but E in 4 is banned.  
E D I T R – not a word.  
E V I T R – not a word.  

Alternative: R E T _ _ → T is in 3, so:  
_ R T _ _  
But R cannot be in 2 (from PETRO feedback: R ≠ 4, but R could be 1,2, or 5).  

Let’s try:  
Put R in position 2.  
Then T in 3.  
E must be in 1 or 4.  
Let’s put E in 4:  
_ R T E _

B R I T E → no, T is in 3, but B and I new – forms “BRITE”? Not standard.  

Real word: W R I T E – but E in 5 is banned.  
F R I T E – not a word.

Another approach:  
Put E in 1.

Let’s use D and N: E D T N R → not a word.  
E N T D R → no.

E N T R Y – but Y is new: positions: E(1), N(2), T(3), R(4) – but R cannot be in 4 (PETRO feedback).  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4, but 4 is banned.  

Seems tricky. Let me list valid patterns:  
Known: T in 3, E must be in 1 or 4, R must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Case 1: E in 1  
Then pattern: E _ T _ _  
R must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be 4)  
Try: E R T _ _ – need 4th and 5th letters:  
E R T I C – not a word.  
E R T I N – valid word “ERTIN” – no.  
E R T O N – no.  

Real word: E R T I N – not standard.  
E R T H O – but H is banned.  

Case 2: E in 4  
Then pattern: _ _ T E _

Try: R _ T E _ – R in 1:  
R _ T E _ – need 2nd letter:  
R I T E N – valid word “RITEN” – no.  
R I T E R – R repeated, but valid word “RITER” – but R in 5 is allowed, but R is already in 1.  
R E T E R – E in 2 and 4 – but E cannot be in 4 is false (only 3,5 banned), so this is allowed, but R E T E R has R in 1 and 5, which is okay.  

Let’s check “R E T E R”:  
- R in 1 – allowed.  
- E in 2 – allowed.  
- T in 3 – fixed.  
- E in 4 – allowed (only 3,5 banned).  
- R in 5 – allowed.  
- No banned letters: S,L,A,H,M,P not present.  

But is “RETER” a valid English word? It’s not standard.  

Real word: “RETRO” – but O is in word but not known position, and we need E in 4:  
R E T R O – but R is in 3,4 – T is fixed in 3, so this is invalid.  

Next valid word: “ENTER” – but E in 4 is allowed here, and N, T, E, R are in play:  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4 – but E in 4 is allowed, and positions:  
- E(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) – but T is fixed in 3, and no banned letters.  
However, from SLATE feedback, E cannot be in 5 (okay here), and from PETRO, E cannot be in 2 (here it’s in 1 and 4) – seems allowed.  

But “ENTER” has E in 1 and 4 – is E allowed twice? The game allows repeated letters.  

Check constraints:  
- T in 3 – ✓  
- E must be somewhere – here in 1 and 4 – both allowed positions.  
- R must be somewhere – here in 5 – allowed.  
- No S,L,A,H,M,P.  

“ENTER” is a valid English word and fits all feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Traditional strong opening words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover frequently used consonants and multiple vowels.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words:
- S is very common in starting positions
- L, T are frequent consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>- S, L, and A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are in the word but in the WRONG positions (-).

So the hidden word:
1. Does not contain S, L, A.
2. Contains T somewhere other than position 4.
3. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next-step letters to test include common consonants like R, N, C, H, M and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

A solid second guess should:
- Re-use T and E in new positions
- Introduce new common letters
- Avoid S, L, A

Candidate structure: put T in 1st or 2nd position, E in 1st–4th position, and fill with new letters.

One effective choice is “THEME”:
- T in 1st position (new spot)
- H, M new letters
- E in 3rd position (new spot)
- Still 5-letter word

Let’s go with THEME.

<guess>THEME</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: THEME -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(x) E(-) M(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE  
   S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ No S, L, A.  
   ⇒ T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   ⇒ E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. THEME  
   T(-) H(x) E(-) M(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ No H, M.  
   ⇒ T is still in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   ⇒ E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.

Combining these constraints:

- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, H, M  
- Required letters: T (somewhere except positions 1 or 4) and E (somewhere except positions 3 or 5)  
- Five-letter word, no repeated letters unless necessary.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

We also want to test new common consonants. Good ones left: R, N, C, D, B, G, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me construct a word that:
- Puts T in a new allowed spot (say position 2)  
- Puts E in a new allowed spot (say position 4)  
- Introduces two fresh consonants and possibly one more vowel  

Candidate: W R I T E – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) – no.  
Try: R E C T O – E in 2, T in 4 – but T cannot be in 4 (from SLATE feedback).  
Try: C R E T E – would have E twice and T in 4 (both bad).  
Try: E R R O T – invalid English word.  
Try: B E N T O – T in 4 again.  
Try: R E N T E – T in 4 again.  
Try: P E T R O – T in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), new letters P, R, O. No forbidden letters (S,L,A,H,M).  

PETRO is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “relating to petroleum or rock/oil”.

Let’s check it meets all constraints:  
- Contains T (position 3 – not 1 or 4) and E (position 2 – not 3,5).  
- No S, L, A, H, M.  
- All new letters P, R, O are allowed.  
- No repeats.

Alternative: R E T _ _ → T is in 3, so:  
_ R T _ _  
But R cannot be in 2 (from PETRO feedback: R ≠ 4, but R could be 1,2, or 5).  

Let’s try:  
Put R in position 2.  
Then T in 3.  
E must be in 1 or 4.  
Let’s put E in 4:  
_ R T E _  
Need letters for 1 and 5: C, N, D, I, etc.  
Valid word: C R T E N → no.  
B R I T E → no, T is in 3, but B and I new – forms “BRITE”? Not standard.  

Real word: W R I T E – but E in 5 is banned.  
F R I T E – not a word.  
B R I T E – not a word.  

Another approach:  
Put E in 1.  
T in 3.  
R in 5.  
Letters needed: 2 and 4: consonants not banned.  
Let’s use D and N: E D T N R → not a word.  
E N T D R → no.  

Real word check:  
E N T R Y – but Y is new: positions: E(1), N(2), T(3), R(4) – but R cannot be in 4 (PETRO feedback).  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4, but 4 is banned.  

Seems tricky. Let me list valid patterns:  
Known: T in 3, E must be in 1 or 4, R must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Case 1: E in 1  
Then pattern: E _ T _ _  
R must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be 4)  
Try: E R T _ _ – need 4th and 5th letters:  
E R T I C – not a word.  
E R T I N – valid word “ERTIN” – no.  
E R T O N – no.  

Real word: E R T I N – not standard.  
E R T H O – but H is banned.  

Case 2: E in 4  
Then pattern: _ _ T E _  
R must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Try: R _ T E _ – R in 1:  
R _ T E _ – need 2nd letter:  
R I T E N – valid word “RITEN” – no.  
R I T E R – R repeated, but valid word “RITER” – but R in 5 is allowed, but R is already in 1.  
R E T E R – E in 2 and 4 – but E cannot be in 4 is false (only 3,5 banned), so this is allowed, but R E T E R has R in 1 and 5, which is okay.  

Let’s check “R E T E R”:  
- R in 1 – allowed.  
- E in 2 – allowed.  
- T in 3 – fixed.  
- E in 4 – allowed (only 3,5 banned).  
- R in 5 – allowed.  
- No banned letters: S,L,A,H,M,P not present.  

But is “RETER” a valid English word? It’s not standard.  

Real word: “RETRO” – but O is in word but not known position, and we need E in 4:  
R E T R O – but R is in 3,4 – T is fixed in 3, so this is invalid.  

Next valid word: “ENTER” – but E in 4 is allowed here, and N, T, E, R are in play:  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4 – but E in 4 is allowed, and positions:  
- E(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) – but T is fixed in 3, and no banned letters.  
However, from SLATE feedback, E cannot be in 5 (okay here), and from PETRO, E cannot be in 2 (here it’s in 1 and 4) – seems allowed.  

But “ENTER” has E in 1 and 4 – is E allowed twice? The game allows repeated letters.  

Check constraints:  
- T in 3 – ✓  
- E must be somewhere – here in 1 and 4 – both allowed positions.  
- R must be somewhere – here in 5 – allowed.  
- No S,L,A,H,M,P.  

“ENTER” is a valid English word and fits all feedback.  

Final choice: ENTER.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Traditional strong opening words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover frequently used consonants and multiple vowels.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words:
- S is very common in starting positions
- L, T are frequent consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>- S, L, and A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are in the word but in the WRONG positions (-).

So the hidden word:
1. Does not contain S, L, A.
2. Contains T somewhere other than position 4.
3. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next-step letters to test include common consonants like R, N, C, H, M and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

A solid second guess should:
- Re-use T and E in new positions
- Introduce new common letters
- Avoid S, L, A

Candidate structure: put T in 1st or 2nd position, E in 1st–4th position, and fill with new letters.

One effective choice is “THEME”:
- T in 1st position (new spot)
- H, M new letters
- E in 3rd position (new spot)
- Still 5-letter word

Let’s go with THEME.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE  
   S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ No S, L, A.

2. THEME

   ⇒ No H, M.  
   ⇒ T is still in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   ⇒ E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.

Combining these constraints:

- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, H, M  
- Required letters: T (somewhere except positions 1 or 4) and E (somewhere except positions 3 or 5)  
- Five-letter word, no repeated letters unless necessary.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

We also want to test new common consonants. Good ones left: R, N, C, D, B, G, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me construct a word that:
- Puts T in a new allowed spot (say position 2)  
- Puts E in a new allowed spot (say position 4)  
- Introduces two fresh consonants and possibly one more vowel  

Candidate: W R I T E – but E is in position 5 (forbidden) – no.  
Try: R E C T O – E in 2, T in 4 – but T cannot be in 4 (from SLATE feedback).  
Try: C R E T E – would have E twice and T in 4 (both bad).  
Try: E R R O T – invalid English word.

Try: P E T R O – T in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), new letters P, R, O. No forbidden letters (S,L,A,H,M).  

PETRO is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “relating to petroleum or rock/oil”.

Let’s check it meets all constraints:  
- Contains T (position 3 – not 1 or 4) and E (position 2 – not 3,5).  
- No S, L, A, H, M.  
- All new letters P, R, O are allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses so far:

1. SLATE → T and E are both in the word but in wrong positions (T ≠ pos 4, E ≠ pos 5).  
2. THEME → T ≠ pos 1, E ≠ pos 3 or 5.  
3. PETRO → T is now confirmed in position 3 (✓), E is still in the word but not in position 2, R is in the word but not in position 4, O is in the word but not in position 5.

Collecting everything:

- Fixed: T in position 3.  
- Required letters still somewhere: E and R.  
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, H, M, P.  
- Allowed positions:  
  – E can be 1 or 4 (cannot be 2, 3, 5).  
  – R can be 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3, 4).  

We need two more letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, I, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Aiming for common consonants and an easy vowel, let’s try:

- Put E in position 1 (first letter).  
- Put R in position 5 (last letter).  
- Fill positions 2 and 4 with new consonants, ensuring no repeats and no banned letters.

Candidate: E _ T _ R  
Good consonants to test: C, N, D.  
Let’s use C and N: E C T N R → valid word “ENTER” – but N is repeated with T already placed, and “ENTER” puts E in pos 1, N in 2, T pos 3, E in 4, R in 5. That would have E twice (acceptable) and use N.  
But we already know E cannot be in position 4 (from THEME feedback). So “ENTER” is invalid because E appears in position 4 which is disallowed.

Try: E D I T R → invalid (T already fixed in 3).  
Try: E V I T N → invalid (T already fixed).  
Try: E R I T C → invalid (R in 2 which is allowed, but T already fixed).  

Wait, we need:

E _ T _ R with positions:  
- 1: E (allowed)  
- 2: any allowed consonant  
- 3: T (fixed)  
- 4: any allowed consonant  
- 5: R (allowed)  

So valid structure: E C T N R → but that forms “ECTNR” – invalid English word.  
Real word examples:  
- “EXTRA” – but X is allowed, and we need to check constraints:  
  – E in 1 (allowed)  
  – X new  
  – T in 3 (fixed)  
  – R in 4 – but R cannot be in 4 (from PETRO feedback). So extra is invalid.  

Next idea:  
E N T I R – valid word “ENTIR” – no, not a word.  
E N T E R – has E twice, but E in 4 is banned.  
E D I T R – not a word.  
E V I T R – not a word.  

Alternative: R E T _ _ → T is in 3, so:  
_ R T _ _  
But R cannot be in 2 (from PETRO feedback: R ≠ 4, but R could be 1,2, or 5).  

Let’s try:  
Put R in position 2.  
Then T in 3.  
E must be in 1 or 4.  
Let’s put E in 4:  
_ R T E _  
Need letters for 1 and 5: C, N, D, I, etc.  
Valid word: C R T E N → no.  
B R I T E → no, T is in 3, but B and I new – forms “BRITE”? Not standard.  

Real word: W R I T E – but E in 5 is banned.  
F R I T E – not a word.  
B R I T E – not a word.  

Another approach:  
Put E in 1.  
T in 3.  
R in 5.  
Letters needed: 2 and 4: consonants not banned.  
Let’s use D and N: E D T N R → not a word.  
E N T D R → no.  

Real word check:  
E N T R Y – but Y is new: positions: E(1), N(2), T(3), R(4) – but R cannot be in 4 (PETRO feedback).  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4, but 4 is banned.  

Seems tricky. Let me list valid patterns:  
Known: T in 3, E must be in 1 or 4, R must be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Case 1: E in 1  
Then pattern: E _ T _ _  
R must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be 4)  
Try: E R T _ _ – need 4th and 5th letters:  
E R T I C – not a word.  
E R T I N – valid word “ERTIN” – no.  
E R T O N – no.  

Real word: E R T I N – not standard.  
E R T H O – but H is banned.  

Case 2: E in 4  
Then pattern: _ _ T E _  
R must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
Try: R _ T E _ – R in 1:  
R _ T E _ – need 2nd letter:  
R I T E N – valid word “RITEN” – no.  
R I T E R – R repeated, but valid word “RITER” – but R in 5 is allowed, but R is already in 1.  
R E T E R – E in 2 and 4 – but E cannot be in 4 is false (only 3,5 banned), so this is allowed, but R E T E R has R in 1 and 5, which is okay.  

Let’s check “R E T E R”:  
- R in 1 – allowed.  
- E in 2 – allowed.  
- T in 3 – fixed.  
- E in 4 – allowed (only 3,5 banned).  
- R in 5 – allowed.  
- No banned letters: S,L,A,H,M,P not present.  

But is “RETER” a valid English word? It’s not standard.  

Real word: “RETRO” – but O is in word but not known position, and we need E in 4:  
R E T R O – but R is in 3,4 – T is fixed in 3, so this is invalid.  

Next valid word: “ENTER” – but E in 4 is allowed here, and N, T, E, R are in play:  
E N T E R – E in 1 and 4 – but E in 4 is allowed, and positions:  
- E(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) – but T is fixed in 3, and no banned letters.  
However, from SLATE feedback, E cannot be in 5 (okay here), and from PETRO, E cannot be in 2 (here it’s in 1 and 4) – seems allowed.  

But “ENTER” has E in 1 and 4 – is E allowed twice? The game allows repeated letters.  

Check constraints:  
- T in 3 – ✓  
- E must be somewhere – here in 1 and 4 – both allowed positions.  
- R must be somewhere – here in 5 – allowed.  
- No S,L,A,H,M,P.  

“ENTER” is a valid English word and fits all feedback.  

Final choice: ENTER.

That is, the pattern “??TER”.

Common words matching this: CATER (A banned), WATER (A banned), BITER (BI allowed), DITER (not a word), GITER (not a word), VOTER (O already ruled in feedback), etc.
