Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I'll use a strategic starting word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- These letters appear in many English words

This will give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we have:

- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letters R, O, E
- NOT contain A or S
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new word that:
1. Uses R, O, E
2. Avoids A and S
3. Places R, O, E in positions that respect the constraints
4. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet

Looking at the remaining high-frequency consonants (T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and the only remaining vowel ""I"", a good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- Contains R (position 2), O (position 3), E (position 5) - but wait, O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, so this violates the constraints.

Let me try another arrangement. The word ""ROVER"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- V is new letter
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 - but we can have only one R in the word, and we already have R in position 1.

Let me try ""OCCUR"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- C, C, U, R - but this has two C's and we don't know if C is in the word.

Better to use letters we know are in the word plus new common letters. The word ""FORCE"":
- F is new
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- C is new
- E is in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5)

Let me try ""ROUTE"":

From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the secret word: A, S, T, H  
- Letters that ARE in the secret word: O, E, R  
- Exact positions that each letter **cannot** be in:
  – O ≠ 1st, 3rd
  – E ≠ 5th
  – R ≠ 2nd, 5th (from Guess 1 and Guess 2)

- Therefore the **only remaining allowed positions** are:
  – O: 2, 4, 5
  – E: 1, 2, 3, 4
  – R: 1, 3, 4

Combining these and eliminating duplicates, the word must be built from the letters {O, E, R} plus **new, untested consonants** (common choices: N, L, C, D, B, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, E, R exactly once each.
2. Places each of them only in positions allowed above.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t appeared yet.

Let’s try the arrangement:
E (position 1), O (position 2), N (position 3), R (position 4), C (position 5)
→ “ENORC” is not an English word.

Instead, try:
R (position 1), O (position 4), E (position 3)
with consonants N and C in remaining positions.
That gives “R N E O C” → “RENOC” – also not valid.

Next candidate:
E (position 1), R (position 3), O (position 4)
with consonants N and C in positions 2 and 5 → “E N R O C” → “NEROC” – still invalid.

Try consonants L and D:
E L R O D → “ELROD” – no.
R E N D O – no.

A valid word appears with:
E (1), N (2), R (3), O (4), D (5)
→ “ENROD” – not valid.

Try B and I:
B (1), R (2) – but R cannot be 2nd.
Forget B.

Try C (1), O (4), E (3), N (2), R (5) – but R cannot be 5th.

A simpler valid word:
R (1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5) – but uses extra letters.

Instead, the simplest valid permutation that forms a real English word is:
R (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
→ “ROVEN” – but “ROVEN” is archaic; “ROVER” uses double R, which we don’t know is allowed.

Real word that fits:
C (1), O (2), R (3), E (4), X (5) – “COREX” – not valid.

Actually, the standard word “GROVE”:
G (new), R (1), O (2), V (new), E (4) – satisfies all known constraints:
- Contains R, O, E
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces G and V which haven’t been used
- It’s a common English word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- These letters appear in many English words

This will give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) we have:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letters R, O, E
- NOT contain A or S
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new word that:
1. Uses R, O, E
2. Avoids A and S
3. Places R, O, E in positions that respect the constraints
4. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet

Looking at the remaining high-frequency consonants (T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and the only remaining vowel ""I"", a good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- Contains R (position 2), O (position 3), E (position 5) - but wait, O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, so this violates the constraints.

Let me try another arrangement. The word ""ROVER"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- V is new letter
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 - but we can have only one R in the word, and we already have R in position 1.

Let me try ""OCCUR"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- C, C, U, R - but this has two C's and we don't know if C is in the word.

Better to use letters we know are in the word plus new common letters. The word ""FORCE"":
- F is new
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- C is new
- E is in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5)

Let me try ""ROUTE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- U is new
- T is new
- E in position 5 (not allowed)

How about ""CORER"":
- C is new
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (but this would be second R, and we don't know if word has double R)

A better approach is to place R, O, E in positions that are allowed. Let me try ""OTHER"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- T is new
- H is new
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This uses all three required letters in allowed positions and introduces new common letters T and H.

- Letters NOT in the secret word: A, S, T, H  
- Letters that ARE in the secret word: O, E, R  
- Exact positions that each letter **cannot** be in:
  – O ≠ 1st, 3rd
  – E ≠ 5th
  – R ≠ 2nd, 5th (from Guess 1 and Guess 2)

- Therefore the **only remaining allowed positions** are:
  – O: 2, 4, 5
  – E: 1, 2, 3, 4
  – R: 1, 3, 4

Combining these and eliminating duplicates, the word must be built from the letters {O, E, R} plus **new, untested consonants** (common choices: N, L, C, D, B, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, E, R exactly once each.
2. Places each of them only in positions allowed above.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t appeared yet.

Let’s try the arrangement:
E (position 1), O (position 2), N (position 3), R (position 4), C (position 5)
→ “ENORC” is not an English word.

Instead, try:
R (position 1), O (position 4), E (position 3)
with consonants N and C in remaining positions.
That gives “R N E O C” → “RENOC” – also not valid.

Next candidate:
E (position 1), R (position 3), O (position 4)
with consonants N and C in positions 2 and 5 → “E N R O C” → “NEROC” – still invalid.

Try consonants L and D:
E L R O D → “ELROD” – no.
R E N D O – no.

A valid word appears with:
E (1), N (2), R (3), O (4), D (5)
→ “ENROD” – not valid.

Try B and I:
B (1), R (2) – but R cannot be 2nd.
Forget B.

Try C (1), O (4), E (3), N (2), R (5) – but R cannot be 5th.

A simpler valid word:
R (1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5) – but uses extra letters.

Instead, the simplest valid permutation that forms a real English word is:
R (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
→ “ROVEN” – but “ROVEN” is archaic; “ROVER” uses double R, which we don’t know is allowed.

Real word that fits:
C (1), O (2), R (3), E (4), X (5) – “COREX” – not valid.

3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t appeared yet.

Let’s try the arrangement:
E (position 1), O (position 2), N (position 3), R (position 4), C (position 5)
→ “ENORC” is not an English word.

Instead, try:
R (position 1), O (position 4), E (position 3)
with consonants N and C in remaining positions.
That gives “R N E O C” → “RENOC” – also not valid.

Next candidate:
E (position 1), R (position 3), O (position 4)
with consonants N and C in positions 2 and 5 → “E N R O C” → “NEROC” – still invalid.

Try consonants L and D:
E L R O D → “ELROD” – no.
R E N D O – no.

A valid word appears with:
E (1), N (2), R (3), O (4), D (5)
→ “ENROD” – not valid.

Try B and I:
B (1), R (2) – but R cannot be 2nd.
Forget B.

Try C (1), O (4), E (3), N (2), R (5) – but R cannot be 5th.

A simpler valid word:
R (1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5) – but uses extra letters.

Instead, the simplest valid permutation that forms a real English word is:
R (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
→ “ROVEN” – but “ROVEN” is archaic; “ROVER” uses double R, which we don’t know is allowed.

Real word that fits:
C (1), O (2), R (3), E (4), X (5) – “COREX” – not valid.

Actually, the standard word “GROVE”:
G (new), R (1), O (2), V (new), E (4) – satisfies all known constraints:
- Contains R, O, E
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces G and V which haven’t been used
- It’s a common English word.

R: 1, 3, 4  

Step 3 – Find a 5-letter English word that uses O, E, R exactly once and places them only in the slots above, while introducing two new consonants we have not tried yet.

List of still-untried common consonants: B, C, D, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Try the permutation  
E (pos 1), R (pos 3), O (pos 4)  
We need two new consonants for positions 2 and 5.

Choose N (pos 2) and C (pos 5) → e n r o c → “NEROC” – not a valid English word.

Choose N (pos 2) and D (pos 5) → e n r o d — not a word.

Choose C (pos 2) and K (pos 5) → e c r o k — not a word.

Try another permutation  
R (pos 1), O (pos 2), E (pos 4)  
We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5 that we haven’t used yet.

Choose N and D → r o n e d — “RONED” – not a word.

Choose N and C → r o n e c — not a word.

Choose M and B → r o m e b — not a word.

Choose B and N → r o b e n — “ROBEN” – not a word.

Choose B and D → r o b e d — “ROBED” – valid English word.

Check constraints for “ROBED”

Letters: R, O, B, E, D  
- Contains O, E, R – ✓  
- O is in position 2 (allowed 2,4,5) – ✓  
- E is in position 4 (allowed 1,2,3,4) – ✓  
- R is in position 1 (allowed 1,3,4) – ✓  
- B and D are new consonants we have not tried – ✓

Let's break down what we now know after four guesses.

Letters in the word (must appear):
- R, O, E

Letters not in the word:
- A, S, T, H, G, V, B

Exact positions confirmed from ROBED feedback:
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)

Positions filled so far:
- 1: R
- 2: O
- 4: E

Positions yet to be determined:
- 3: ?
- 5: ?

Letters allowed for these positions:
- Must be from unused letters (not A, S, T, H, G, V, B)
- Common remaining options: C, D, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z

From ROBED feedback:
- D is not in the word (D(-) in position 5)

So position 5 cannot be D.

Looking at position 3 and 5, we need two new consonants (or possibly a vowel like I/U) that haven't been tried.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: C, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: C, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z (but not D)

Let's try common consonants first. The word structure is R O _ E _

Possible words:
- R O C E N → ROCEN (invalid)
- R O C E K → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O N E Y → RONEY (invalid)
- R O I N E → ROINE (invalid)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E Y → ROMEY (invalid)
- R O M E L → ROMEL (invalid)
- R O M E D → ROMED (invalid)
- R O F E N → ROFEN (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual English words that fit R O _ E _

Real words:
- R O C K E → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O M E O → ROMEO (but O already used)
- R O M E R → ROMER (invalid)
- R O M E S → ROMES (S is out)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E Y → ROMEY (invalid)
- R O F E N → ROFEN (invalid)

Hmm, let's try:
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E L → ROMEL (invalid)
- R O M E C → ROMEC (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual 5-letter words starting with RO and having E in 4th position.

Known words:
- R O W E N → ROWEN (valid word meaning ""young tree"")
- R O M E O → ROMEO (but O is already used twice, unlikely)
- R O C K E → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O M E R → ROMER (invalid)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)

""ROWEN"" is a valid English word:
- R, O, W, E, N
- W and N are new letters we haven't tried
- Fits the confirmed positions R(1), O(2), E(4)
- None of these letters are forbidden

Let me check:
Letters used: R, O, E (required), plus W and N (new)
No forbidden letters (A, S, T, H, G, V, B not present)
Positions:
- R(1) ✓
- O(2) ✓
- W(3) - new
- E(4) ✓
- N(5) - new

This seems like a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- These letters appear in many English words

This will give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (-)

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letters R, O, E
- NOT contain A or S
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a new word that:
1. Uses R, O, E
2. Avoids A and S
3. Places R, O, E in positions that respect the constraints
4. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet

Looking at the remaining high-frequency consonants (T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and the only remaining vowel ""I"", a good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- Contains R (position 2), O (position 3), E (position 5) - but wait, O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, so this violates the constraints.

Let me try another arrangement. The word ""ROVER"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- V is new letter
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 - but we can have only one R in the word, and we already have R in position 1.

Let me try ""OCCUR"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- C, C, U, R - but this has two C's and we don't know if C is in the word.

Better to use letters we know are in the word plus new common letters. The word ""FORCE"":
- F is new
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- C is new
- E is in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5)

Let me try ""ROUTE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- U is new
- T is new
- E in position 5 (not allowed)

How about ""CORER"":
- C is new
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (but this would be second R, and we don't know if word has double R)

A better approach is to place R, O, E in positions that are allowed. Let me try ""OTHER"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- T is new
- H is new
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This uses all three required letters in allowed positions and introduces new common letters T and H.

Guess 2: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(-) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the secret word: A, S, T, H  
- Letters that ARE in the secret word: O, E, R  
- Exact positions that each letter **cannot** be in:
  – O ≠ 1st, 3rd
  – E ≠ 5th
  – R ≠ 2nd, 5th (from Guess 1 and Guess 2)

- Therefore the **only remaining allowed positions** are:
  – O: 2, 4, 5
  – E: 1, 2, 3, 4
  – R: 1, 3, 4

Combining these and eliminating duplicates, the word must be built from the letters {O, E, R} plus **new, untested consonants** (common choices: N, L, C, D, B, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, E, R exactly once each.
2. Places each of them only in positions allowed above.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t appeared yet.

Let’s try the arrangement:
E (position 1), O (position 2), N (position 3), R (position 4), C (position 5)
→ “ENORC” is not an English word.

Instead, try:
R (position 1), O (position 4), E (position 3)
with consonants N and C in remaining positions.
That gives “R N E O C” → “RENOC” – also not valid.

Next candidate:
E (position 1), R (position 3), O (position 4)
with consonants N and C in positions 2 and 5 → “E N R O C” → “NEROC” – still invalid.

Try consonants L and D:
E L R O D → “ELROD” – no.
R E N D O – no.

A valid word appears with:
E (1), N (2), R (3), O (4), D (5)
→ “ENROD” – not valid.

Try B and I:
B (1), R (2) – but R cannot be 2nd.
Forget B.

Try C (1), O (4), E (3), N (2), R (5) – but R cannot be 5th.

A simpler valid word:
R (1), O (2), U (3), N (4), D (5) – but uses extra letters.

Instead, the simplest valid permutation that forms a real English word is:
R (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), N (5)
→ “ROVEN” – but “ROVEN” is archaic; “ROVER” uses double R, which we don’t know is allowed.

Real word that fits:
C (1), O (2), R (3), E (4), X (5) – “COREX” – not valid.

Actually, the standard word “GROVE”:
G (new), R (1), O (2), V (new), E (4) – satisfies all known constraints:
- Contains R, O, E
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces G and V which haven’t been used
- It’s a common English word.

Step 3 – Find a 5-letter English word that uses O, E, R exactly once and places them only in the slots above, while introducing two new consonants we have not tried yet.

List of still-untried common consonants: B, C, D, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Try the permutation  
E (pos 1), R (pos 3), O (pos 4)  
We need two new consonants for positions 2 and 5.

Choose N (pos 2) and C (pos 5) → e n r o c → “NEROC” – not a valid English word.

Choose N (pos 2) and D (pos 5) → e n r o d — not a word.

Choose C (pos 2) and K (pos 5) → e c r o k — not a word.

Try another permutation  
R (pos 1), O (pos 2), E (pos 4)  
We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5 that we haven’t used yet.

Choose N and D → r o n e d — “RONED” – not a word.

Choose N and C → r o n e c — not a word.

Choose M and B → r o m e b — not a word.

Choose B and N → r o b e n — “ROBEN” – not a word.

Choose B and D → r o b e d — “ROBED” – valid English word.

Check constraints for “ROBED”

Letters: R, O, B, E, D  
- Contains O, E, R – ✓  
- O is in position 2 (allowed 2,4,5) – ✓  
- E is in position 4 (allowed 1,2,3,4) – ✓  
- R is in position 1 (allowed 1,3,4) – ✓  
- B and D are new consonants we have not tried – ✓  
- No forbidden letters used – ✓  

Therefore “ROBED” is a perfectly valid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's break down what we now know after four guesses.

Letters in the word (must appear):
- R, O, E

Letters not in the word:
- A, S, T, H, G, V, B

Exact positions confirmed from ROBED feedback:
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)

Positions filled so far:
- 1: R
- 2: O
- 4: E

Positions yet to be determined:
- 3: ?
- 5: ?

Letters allowed for these positions:
- Must be from unused letters (not A, S, T, H, G, V, B)
- Common remaining options: C, D, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z

From ROBED feedback:
- D is not in the word (D(-) in position 5)

So position 5 cannot be D.

Looking at position 3 and 5, we need two new consonants (or possibly a vowel like I/U) that haven't been tried.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: C, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: C, F, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, X, Y, Z (but not D)

Let's try common consonants first. The word structure is R O _ E _

Possible words:
- R O C E N → ROCEN (invalid)
- R O C E K → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O N E Y → RONEY (invalid)
- R O I N E → ROINE (invalid)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E Y → ROMEY (invalid)
- R O M E L → ROMEL (invalid)
- R O M E D → ROMED (invalid)
- R O F E N → ROFEN (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual English words that fit R O _ E _

Real words:
- R O C K E → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O M E O → ROMEO (but O already used)
- R O M E R → ROMER (invalid)
- R O M E S → ROMES (S is out)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E Y → ROMEY (invalid)
- R O F E N → ROFEN (invalid)

Hmm, let's try:
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)
- R O M E L → ROMEL (invalid)
- R O M E C → ROMEC (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual 5-letter words starting with RO and having E in 4th position.

Known words:
- R O W E N → ROWEN (valid word meaning ""young tree"")
- R O M E O → ROMEO (but O is already used twice, unlikely)
- R O C K E → ROCKE (invalid)
- R O M E R → ROMER (invalid)
- R O M E N → ROMEN (invalid)

""ROWEN"" is a valid English word:
- R, O, W, E, N
- W and N are new letters we haven't tried
- Fits the confirmed positions R(1), O(2), E(4)
- None of these letters are forbidden

Let me check:
Letters used: R, O, E (required), plus W and N (new)
No forbidden letters (A, S, T, H, G, V, B not present)
Positions:
- R(1) ✓
- O(2) ✓
- W(3) - new
- E(4) ✓
- N(5) - new

This seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word starts with R-O-_-E-_
- Must contain R, O, E in these exact positions
- Cannot contain A, S, T, H, G, V, B, D
- Need two new consonants for positions 3 and 5

1: R (✓)  
2: O (✓)  
4: E (✓)  

Letters **not** in the word  
A, S, T, H, G, V, B, D, W, N  

So only positions 3 and 5 remain unknown, and they must be letters **not** on that exclusion list.

Usable letters left (common ones)  
C, F, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word of the form  
R O _ E _  
with the blanks filled by letters from the usable set.

Real English words that fit:
- R O M E O  – repeats O, unlikely  
- R O C K E  – invalid spelling  
- R O M E R  – invalid  
- R O C C E  – invalid  
- R O I C E  – invalid  
- R O M E Y  – invalid  
- R O L E X  – invalid  
- R O M E R  – invalid  
- R O I L E  – invalid  
- R O M E R  – invalid  

Only valid word left: **ROMEO** (the name).  It keeps R, O, E in their fixed spots, uses M for position 3 and repeats O for position 5.  Allowing a repeat is acceptable until we know otherwise, and no excluded letters are used.

So we’ll try ROMEO next.",Guess 6: ROMEO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) O(✓),FAIL
