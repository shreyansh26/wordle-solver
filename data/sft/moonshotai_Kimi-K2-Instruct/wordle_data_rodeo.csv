For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information by covering common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- AUDIO (covers common vowels)
- ADIEU (common vowels)
- STARE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (good mix)
- SLATE (covers common letters)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it has:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)
- E: in word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. E is in the word but not at the 5th position.
2. None of S, L, A, T appears at all.

Next I need a word that:
- Uses E in a different position
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely
- Introduces new common letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

Good candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word with E in position 1 or 2 and include fresh common letters. “CHORE” is ideal:
- C, H, O, R, E
- E is now in position 5, but since E was in wrong position before (position 5 was marked -), this time E will be in position 2.
- Introduces C, H, O, R.

Actually let me pick a word that puts E in 2nd or 3rd or 4th position. Let me choose “REIGN”:
- R, E, I, G, N
- E is in 2nd position (new position)
- Uses new letters R, I, G, N.

However ""REIGN"" is 5 letters so it fits.

But I need to double-check: S,L,A,T are excluded. ""REIGN"" contains none of S,L,A,T.

So REIGN seems good.

But actually, let me pick ""CHIME"":
- C, H, I, M, E
- E in 5th position again, but 5th was marked as wrong position for E in SLATE, so this is not good.

Alternative: ""MERGE"":
- M, E, R, G, E
- E in 2nd and 5th. 5th is wrong, but 2nd is new.

But having E twice might not be optimal for info.

Let me pick ""FRIED"":
- F, R, I, E, D
- E in 4th position
- Introduces F, R, I, D

""FRIED"" seems good.

But let me pick a word with no repeated letters and E in a new spot. ""CRANE"" was suggested but has A which is excluded.

""REIGN"" is actually fine.

Wait, let me pick ""BIRCH"":
- B, I, R, C, H
- But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

We must include E.

So need E in a new position and avoid S, L, A, T.

Best choices:
- E in 2nd: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) but V is less common
- E in 3rd: ""PRICE"" (P, R, I, C, E)
- E in 4th: ""FRIED"" (F, R, I, E, D)

""PRICE"" seems balanced with common letters P, R, I, C, E.

- R must be in the word, but not in position 2.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- AUDIO (covers common vowels)
- ADIEU (common vowels)
- STARE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (good mix)
- SLATE (covers common letters)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it has:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

- S: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)
- E: in word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. E is in the word but not at the 5th position.
2. None of S, L, A, T appears at all.

Next I need a word that:
- Uses E in a different position
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely
- Introduces new common letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

Good candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word with E in position 1 or 2 and include fresh common letters. “CHORE” is ideal:
- C, H, O, R, E
- E is now in position 5, but since E was in wrong position before (position 5 was marked -), this time E will be in position 2.
- Introduces C, H, O, R.

Actually let me pick a word that puts E in 2nd or 3rd or 4th position. Let me choose “REIGN”:
- R, E, I, G, N
- E is in 2nd position (new position)
- Uses new letters R, I, G, N.

However ""REIGN"" is 5 letters so it fits.

But I need to double-check: S,L,A,T are excluded. ""REIGN"" contains none of S,L,A,T.

So REIGN seems good.

But actually, let me pick ""CHIME"":
- C, H, I, M, E
- E in 5th position again, but 5th was marked as wrong position for E in SLATE, so this is not good.

Alternative: ""MERGE"":
- M, E, R, G, E
- E in 2nd and 5th. 5th is wrong, but 2nd is new.

But having E twice might not be optimal for info.

Let me pick ""FRIED"":
- F, R, I, E, D
- E in 4th position
- Introduces F, R, I, D

""FRIED"" seems good.

But let me pick a word with no repeated letters and E in a new spot. ""CRANE"" was suggested but has A which is excluded.

""REIGN"" is actually fine.

Wait, let me pick ""BIRCH"":
- B, I, R, C, H
- But this lacks E which we know is in the word.

We must include E.

So need E in a new position and avoid S, L, A, T.

Best choices:
- E in 2nd: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) but V is less common
- E in 3rd: ""PRICE"" (P, R, I, C, E)
- E in 4th: ""FRIED"" (F, R, I, E, D)

""PRICE"" seems balanced with common letters P, R, I, C, E.

E is in 5th position in SLATE (marked -), so 3rd position is new.

So:
- R must be in the word, but not in position 2.
- E must be in the word, but not in position 5.
- We need fresh letters for positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding the above banned letters).

Remaining common letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that includes both E and R, places them in new positions, and only uses letters not yet excluded.

Possible patterns:
- E in 1st, R elsewhere (e.g., E R _ _ _)
- E in 2nd, R elsewhere (e.g., _ E _ _ R)
- E in 3rd, R elsewhere (e.g., _ _ E _ R)
- E in 4th, R elsewhere (e.g., _ _ _ E R)

Let me think of words:
- ERUPT: uses U (not yet tested), T is excluded. Not good.
- EVERY: but V and Y are less common, and E and R are placed.
- OMBER: O, M, B, E, R – but O, M, B are new and allowed.
- HORDE: H, O, R, D, E – good letters, E in 4th (new), R in 3rd (new).
- HORSE: but S is excluded.
- HONER: H, O, N, E, R – E in 4th (new), R in 5th (new).

- Pos 4 = E
Letters that are *not* in the word: S, L, A, T, P, I, C, H, N.

Letters that *must* appear somewhere: R (from PRICE and HONER).
Letters that must be exactly: _ O _ E _ , with R still needing a slot (cannot be in pos 5).

Possible remaining positions for R: 1 or 3.

We also need a fifth letter that has not been eliminated.
Allowed candidate letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Two main patterns to test:
1. R at pos 1: R O _ E _
2. R at pos 3: _ O R E _

Let’s look for valid 5-letter English words that fit either pattern.

Pattern 1 (R O _ E _):
- R O ? E ?  →  “ROGER” (G allowed, but R is repeated – fine for pattern, but we already know R is in word; still valid as a guess)
- “ROVER”  – V allowed
- “ROWER” – W allowed
- “ROMER” – M allowed

Pattern 2 (_ O R E _):
- ? O R E ?  →  “FOREX” but X is rare; “FOREM” not a word
- “GORED” – D allowed
- “BORED” – B, D allowed

Among these, “ROGER” fits perfectly:
- R at 1 (new position for R)
- O at 2 (correct)
- G at 3 (new letter)
- E at 4 (correct)
- R at 5 – but R is already in word and can be repeated to test placement, but we know pos 5 for R is wrong from HONER feedback. However the puzzle allows any valid word as guess.

Actually, let me avoid double R and pick from pattern 2: “BORED”
- B at 1 (new)
- O at 2 (correct)
- R at 3 (new position for R)
- E at 4 (correct)
- D at 5 (new)

- OMBER: O, M, B, E, R – but O, M, B are new and allowed.
- HORDE: H, O, R, D, E – good letters, E in 4th (new), R in 3rd (new).
- HORSE: but S is excluded.
- HONER: H, O, N, E, R – E in 4th (new), R in 5th (new).

""HONER"" seems good:
- Letters: H, O, N, E, R
- All letters not yet excluded.
- E is in 4th position (was 5th before, now new).
- R is in 5th position (was 2nd before, now new).

Let's verify:
- No S, L, A, T, P, I, C involved – correct.
- Uses E and R in new positions – correct.
- Common letters – H, O, N are reasonably common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 3 (HONER) we just got:

- N(x) … N is not in the word.
- E(✓) … E is in the word and in the correct position (here position 4).
- R(-) … R is in the word but in the wrong position (here position 5).

So far we are certain about:
- Pos 2 = O
- Pos 4 = E
Letters that are *not* in the word: S, L, A, T, P, I, C, H, N.

Letters that *must* appear somewhere: R (from PRICE and HONER).
Letters that must be exactly: _ O _ E _ , with R still needing a slot (cannot be in pos 5).

Possible remaining positions for R: 1 or 3.

We also need a fifth letter that has not been eliminated.
Allowed candidate letters (not excluded): B, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Two main patterns to test:
1. R at pos 1: R O _ E _
2. R at pos 3: _ O R E _

Let’s look for valid 5-letter English words that fit either pattern.

Pattern 1 (R O _ E _):
- R O ? E ?  →  “ROGER” (G allowed, but R is repeated – fine for pattern, but we already know R is in word; still valid as a guess)
- “ROVER”  – V allowed
- “ROWER” – W allowed
- “ROMER” – M allowed

Pattern 2 (_ O R E _):
- ? O R E ?  →  “FOREX” but X is rare; “FOREM” not a word
- “GORED” – D allowed
- “BORED” – B, D allowed

Among these, “ROGER” fits perfectly:
- R at 1 (new position for R)
- O at 2 (correct)
- G at 3 (new letter)
- E at 4 (correct)
- R at 5 – but R is already in word and can be repeated to test placement, but we know pos 5 for R is wrong from HONER feedback. However the puzzle allows any valid word as guess.

Actually, let me avoid double R and pick from pattern 2: “BORED”
- B at 1 (new)
- O at 2 (correct)
- R at 3 (new position for R)
- E at 4 (correct)
- D at 5 (new)

“BORED” looks ideal.

Current confirmed information:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 4: E (✓)
Letters **excluded** so far: S, L, A, T, P, I, C, H, N, B, D.
Letters **known to be present** but whose exact position is still unknown: R.

Letters still allowed: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known ones O and E already fixed.

Word pattern: _ O _ E _

R must appear somewhere in the remaining three open positions (1, 3, 5).

Possible patterns:
1. R O _ E _
2. _ O R E _
3. _ O _ E R

The pattern _ O R E _ (R in position 3) is the only one we have not tested yet for R, since in HONER R was in position 5 (marked -), and in BORED R was in position 3 (marked -). But wait, in BORED R was in position 3 and got a -, so R is NOT in position 3.

So possible positions for R:
- Position 1: R O _ E _
- Position 5: _ O _ E R

We also need a 5th letter for the remaining blank, chosen from the still-allowed letters.

Let's list the remaining letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common letter to maximize information. Candidates: F, G, K, M, U, W.

Pattern possibilities:
1. R O ? E ?
   - R O F E ? → no common word
   - R O G E R → but D is excluded, and second R would repeat
   - R O M E O → but O repeats
   - R O W E L → but L excluded
   - R O M E N → N excluded
   - R O M E Y → ""ROMEY"" is not a valid word
   - R O K E L → L excluded
   - R O V E R → but ""ROVER"" is valid, let me check: R, O, V, E, R. It uses V (allowed) and positions R at 1 and 5. Since R was marked - at 5 in HONER, but not yet confirmed for 1. So this is a good test.

2. ? O ? E R
   - ? O ? E R → need 3rd letter. For example:
   - F O G E R → but G allowed, F allowed, E and R correct positions.
   - F O M E R → ""FOMER"" is not a word.
   - G O F E R → ""GOFER"" is a valid word (means an errand runner). G, O, F, E, R. G and F are new and allowed. R is in position 5 (we know it's wrong from HONER, but it's still a valid guess to confirm R can't be in 5).

Between ""ROVER"" (pattern R O V E R) and ""GOFER"" (pattern G O F E R), ""ROVER"" is more straightforward and uses V which is common enough.

Let's pick ""ROVER"":
- R in position 1 (new)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- V in position 3 (new)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- R in position 5 (but we know from HONER that R in 5 is wrong — still, the guess is valid and will confirm R is in 1)

Actually, from HONER feedback: R(-) at position 5 and from BORED R(-) at position 3. So R cannot be in 3 or 5. Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word must be:
R O ? E _

And the missing letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- R O ? E ?
  - R O F E R → but R at 5 we know is wrong.
  - R O G E R → R at 5 is wrong.
  - R O V E R → same issue.
  - R O M E O → O repeats.
  - R O W E L → L excluded.
  - R O M E Y → ""ROMEY"" is not valid.
  - R O K E Y → ""ROKEY"" is not valid.
  - R O K E N → N excluded.
  - R O J E K → ""ROJEK"" is not valid.
  - R O G E T → T excluded.

Hmm, the only valid word I see is ""ROGER"", but it repeats R at 5 which we know is wrong.

Wait, the word must be R O _ E _ and the last letter cannot be R (since R at 5 is wrong). So we need _ to be one of the allowed letters, and form a valid word.

Possible:
- R O U G E → but that is ""ROUGE"" which is 5 letters and valid (means red in French, also used in English for makeup). Letters: R, O, U, G, E. U and G are allowed.

""ROUGE"" seems to fit:
- R at 1 (new)
- O at 2 (correct)
- U at 3 (new)
- G at 4 – but E must be at 4, so this is wrong. Actually G at 4 conflicts with E at 4. So ""ROUGE"" is R O U G E – G at 4 is wrong.

I made a mistake. The pattern is fixed at _ O _ E _, so positions are:
1: ?
2: O
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

We know R must be in 1, 3, or 5. From HONER R was at 5 and marked - (wrong). From BORED R was at 3 and marked - (wrong). So R must be at 1.

Thus the word must be:
R O ? E _

And the missing letter at position 3 must be from allowed letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form R O ? E _:
- R O C E K → C excluded.
- R O D E O → D excluded.
- R O F E N → N excluded.
- R O G E N → N excluded.
- R O V E R → but R at 5 we know is wrong.
- R O W E N → N excluded.
- R O W E L → L excluded.
- R O X E Y → ""ROXEY"" is not a word.
- R O Z E Y → ""ROZEY"" is not a word.
- R O V E N → N excluded.
- R O V E D → D excluded.
- R O M E O → O repeats.

The only valid word fitting is ""ROVER"", but R at 5 is wrong. So let me re-examine allowed letters.

Actually, from BORED feedback: D(-) means D is in the word but not at position 5. So D is in the word, but we hadn't confirmed it before. This changes things.

So letters known to be in the word:
- O at 2
- E at 4
- R somewhere (not 3, not 5)
- D somewhere (not 5)

Thus R must be at 1, and D must be at 3 (only remaining spot).

Thus the word must be:
R O D E _

The last letter (position 5) must be one of the allowed letters. But we have used R, O, D, E. Remaining allowed letters to fill position 5: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words R O D E ?:
- R O D E O → but O repeats.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not valid.
- R O D E K → ""RODEK"" is not valid.
- R O D E S → S excluded.
- R O D E Z → ""RODEZ"" is not valid.
- R O D E M → ""RODEM"" is not valid.

Wait, ""RODEO"" is a valid word but repeats O.

""RODED"" is valid but D repeats.

""ROGER"" is R O G E R – R repeats.

I think the only valid word left is ""RODEO"", but O repeats. However O is already in position 2, so it could technically appear again.

But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, from BORED feedback: D(-) means D is in the word but not at 5. So D could be at 3.

So word could be _ O D E R, but R at 5 is wrong.

Or _ O _ E D, but D at 5 is wrong.

Or D O _ E _, but D at 1 is possible.

Let me re-examine:

Known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Letters in word: R (not 3, not 5), D (not 5)
- So R must be at 1 or 3, but 3 is excluded, so R at 1.
- D must be at 3 (only remaining spot).

Thus the word must be:
R O D E _

Now the last letter must be from allowed and form a word. The remaining allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for R O D E ?:
- R O D E K → ""RODEK"" is not a word.
- R O D E Z → ""RODEZ"" is not a word.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not a word.

This seems impossible. Perhaps I made an error.

Let me re-examine the patterns:

From all feedback:
- Letters not in word: S, L, A, T, P, I, C, H, N, B (from BORED B(x))
- Letters in word: O (pos 2), E (pos 4), R, D (both must appear somewhere)

Possible positions:
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Known: 2=O, 4=E
Letters to place: R, D
Possible spots: 1,3,5 for R and D, with:
- R cannot be 3 (from BORED R(-) at 3) and cannot be 5 (from HONER R(-) at 5)
Thus R must be at 1.

D cannot be at 5 (from BORED D(-) at 5), so D must be at 3.

Thus the word is:
R O D E _

Now the last letter (position 5) must be one of the allowed letters not yet excluded, and form a valid word. The letters already used are R, O, D, E.

Looking for R O D E ?:
- R O D E K → not a word.
- R O D E M → ""RODEM"" is not a word.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not a word.
- R O D E N → N is excluded.
- R O D E F → ""RODEF"" is not a word.
- R O D E G → ""RODEG"" is not a word.

The only valid word I can find in this pattern is ""RODEO"":
- R O D E O
- O repeats, but O is already at position 2, so this is acceptable.

""RODEO"" is a valid English word meaning a cattle-herding competition.

Thus the guess is:

<guess>RODEO</guess>
</think>

We now know:
- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = E (✓)
- R must appear (but cannot be in positions 3 or 5).
- D must appear (but cannot be in position 5).
The only arrangement that satisfies these constraints and uses only permitted letters is R O D E O.

- R in position 5 (but we know from HONER that R in 5 is wrong — still, the guess is valid and will confirm R is in 1)

Actually, from HONER feedback: R(-) at position 5 and from BORED R(-) at position 3. So R cannot be in 3 or 5. Therefore R must be in position 1.

So the word must be:
R O ? E _

And the missing letter (position 3) must be from allowed letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- R O ? E ?
  - R O F E R → but R at 5 we know is wrong.
  - R O G E R → R at 5 is wrong.
  - R O V E R → same issue.
  - R O M E O → O repeats.
  - R O W E L → L excluded.
  - R O M E Y → ""ROMEY"" is not valid.
  - R O K E Y → ""ROKEY"" is not valid.
  - R O K E N → N excluded.
  - R O J E K → ""ROJEK"" is not valid.
  - R O G E T → T excluded.

Hmm, the only valid word I see is ""ROGER"", but it repeats R at 5 which we know is wrong.

Wait, the word must be R O _ E _ and the last letter cannot be R (since R at 5 is wrong). So we need _ to be one of the allowed letters, and form a valid word.

Possible:
- R O U G E → but that is ""ROUGE"" which is 5 letters and valid (means red in French, also used in English for makeup). Letters: R, O, U, G, E. U and G are allowed.

""ROUGE"" seems to fit:
- R at 1 (new)
- O at 2 (correct)
- U at 3 (new)
- G at 4 – but E must be at 4, so this is wrong. Actually G at 4 conflicts with E at 4. So ""ROUGE"" is R O U G E – G at 4 is wrong.

I made a mistake. The pattern is fixed at _ O _ E _, so positions are:
1: ?
2: O
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

We know R must be in 1, 3, or 5. From HONER R was at 5 and marked - (wrong). From BORED R was at 3 and marked - (wrong). So R must be at 1.

Thus the word must be:
R O ? E _

And the missing letter at position 3 must be from allowed letters: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form R O ? E _:
- R O C E K → C excluded.
- R O D E O → D excluded.
- R O F E N → N excluded.
- R O G E N → N excluded.
- R O V E R → but R at 5 we know is wrong.
- R O W E N → N excluded.
- R O W E L → L excluded.
- R O X E Y → ""ROXEY"" is not a word.
- R O Z E Y → ""ROZEY"" is not a word.
- R O V E N → N excluded.
- R O V E D → D excluded.
- R O M E O → O repeats.

The only valid word fitting is ""ROVER"", but R at 5 is wrong. So let me re-examine allowed letters.

Actually, from BORED feedback: D(-) means D is in the word but not at position 5. So D is in the word, but we hadn't confirmed it before. This changes things.

So letters known to be in the word:
- O at 2
- E at 4
- R somewhere (not 3, not 5)
- D somewhere (not 5)

Thus R must be at 1, and D must be at 3 (only remaining spot).

Thus the word must be:
R O D E _

The last letter (position 5) must be one of the allowed letters. But we have used R, O, D, E. Remaining allowed letters to fill position 5: F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words R O D E ?:
- R O D E O → but O repeats.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not valid.
- R O D E K → ""RODEK"" is not valid.
- R O D E S → S excluded.
- R O D E Z → ""RODEZ"" is not valid.
- R O D E M → ""RODEM"" is not valid.

Wait, ""RODEO"" is a valid word but repeats O.

""RODED"" is valid but D repeats.

""ROGER"" is R O G E R – R repeats.

I think the only valid word left is ""RODEO"", but O repeats. However O is already in position 2, so it could technically appear again.

But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, from BORED feedback: D(-) means D is in the word but not at 5. So D could be at 3.

So word could be _ O D E R, but R at 5 is wrong.

Or _ O _ E D, but D at 5 is wrong.

Or D O _ E _, but D at 1 is possible.

Let me re-examine:

Known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Letters in word: R (not 3, not 5), D (not 5)
- So R must be at 1 or 3, but 3 is excluded, so R at 1.
- D must be at 3 (only remaining spot).

Thus the word must be:
R O D E _

Now the last letter must be from allowed and form a word. The remaining allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for R O D E ?:
- R O D E K → ""RODEK"" is not a word.
- R O D E Z → ""RODEZ"" is not a word.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not a word.

This seems impossible. Perhaps I made an error.

Let me re-examine the patterns:

From all feedback:
- Letters not in word: S, L, A, T, P, I, C, H, N, B (from BORED B(x))
- Letters in word: O (pos 2), E (pos 4), R, D (both must appear somewhere)

Possible positions:
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Known: 2=O, 4=E
Letters to place: R, D
Possible spots: 1,3,5 for R and D, with:
- R cannot be 3 (from BORED R(-) at 3) and cannot be 5 (from HONER R(-) at 5)
Thus R must be at 1.

D cannot be at 5 (from BORED D(-) at 5), so D must be at 3.

Thus the word is:
R O D E _

Now the last letter (position 5) must be one of the allowed letters not yet excluded, and form a valid word. The letters already used are R, O, D, E.

Looking for R O D E ?:
- R O D E K → not a word.
- R O D E M → ""RODEM"" is not a word.
- R O D E Y → ""RODEY"" is not a word.
- R O D E N → N is excluded.
- R O D E F → ""RODEF"" is not a word.
- R O D E G → ""RODEG"" is not a word.

The only valid word I can find in this pattern is ""RODEO"":
- R O D E O
- O repeats, but O is already at position 2, so this is acceptable.

""RODEO"" is a valid English word meaning a cattle-herding competition.

Thus the guess is:

<guess>RODEO</guess>We now know:
- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = E (✓)
- R must appear (but cannot be in positions 3 or 5).
- D must appear (but cannot be in position 5).
The only arrangement that satisfies these constraints and uses only permitted letters is R O D E O.",Guess 5: RODEO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) D(✓) E(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
