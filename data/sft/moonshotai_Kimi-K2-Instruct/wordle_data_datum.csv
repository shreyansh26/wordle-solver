This is the first guess with no prior information, so I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Cover both vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these.

Some good options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with STARE as it contains:
- S (very common initial letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

From the feedback:
- S, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).

So we need:
1. A word that contains T and A.
2. T is not in position 2.
3. A is not in position 3.
4. We must avoid S, R, E entirely.

I’ll build a word with T and A in new spots while avoiding S, R, E. Good candidates:
- T and A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since T ≠ 2 and A ≠ 3).
- Let’s try A in position 1 and T in position 4 for maximum info.

Word: A (pos 1), _ (pos 2), _ (pos 3), T (pos 4), _ (pos 5). Remaining letters to test: O, U, C, L, N, etc. 

Possible word: ABOUT (A, B, O, U, T). 
- Contains A and T in new positions.
- Avoids S, R, E.
- Tests new letters B, O, U.

Another check: T is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 1 (allowed), and no banned letters. This seems valid.

From the two guesses and their feedback:

1. STARE → S(x) T(-) A(-) R(x) E(x)
   - Missing letters: S, R, E
   - Present letters: T, A (but each is in the wrong position)

2. ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(x) U(✓) T(-)
   - Missing letters: B, O
   - Present letters: U (and it’s in the correct 4th position), T, A (but again, they’re in wrong spots)

Summary of constraints so far:
- Correct letters found so far: U (must be in position 4).
- Letters that must appear somewhere: T, A (since each got “-” twice).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, R, E, B, O.

So the 5-letter word looks like: _ _ _ U _
We still need to place T and A somewhere, but not where they appeared before.

Positions ruled out:
- T cannot be in 2 or 5 (from STARE and ABOUT).
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 (from STARE and ABOUT).

Therefore possible placements:
- T could be in 1 or 3.  
- A could be in 2 or 5.

We also need one more letter (since we have only three letters confirmed so far: T, A, U). This letter must be from the remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. We want a common one to maximize information gain; good candidates: I, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P.

Let’s try to arrange:
Option 1: place T in 1, A in 2, pick a new letter for 3 or 5. But U is locked in 4.
   1 2 3 4 5
   T A _ U _
Need a letter for 3 or 5. Let’s pick N for 3 and see if we can make a word: T A N U ? But we need a 5-letter word; TANU? isn’t valid. So pick a letter for 5. Let’s pick N for 5: T A _ U N. Need a letter for 3. Let’s pick D: T A D U N → TADUN (not valid). Pick C: T A C U N → TACUN (not valid). Pick L: T A L U N → TALUN (not valid). Hmm.

Option 2: T in 3, A in 2 or 5.
   1 2 3 4 5
   _ A T U _
Need letters for 1 and 5. Missing letters: must avoid S, R, E, B, O. Let’s pick C for 1 and H for 5: C A T U H → CATUH (not valid). Or pick L for 1 and D for 5: L A T U D → LATUD (nope). Or M for 1 and N for 5: M A T U N → MATUN (invalid). Not getting good words.

Option 3: T in 3, A in 5.
   1 2 3 4 5
   _ _ T U A
Need letters for 1 and 2. Pick from remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let’s pick C and H: C H T U A → CHTUA (invalid). Or C and L: C L T U A → CLTUA (invalid). Or N and D: N D T U A → NDTUA (invalid). Or H and I: H I T U A → HITUA (invalid). Or M and I: M I T U A → MITUA (invalid). Not working.

Option 4: T in 1, A in 5.
   1 2 3 4 5
   T _ _ U A
Need letters for 2 and 3. Pick from remaining common letters. Let’s pick I and N: T I N U A → TINUA (invalid). Or D and I: T D I U A → TDIUA (invalid). Or C and H: T C H U A → TCHUA (invalid). Or M and I: T M I U A → TMIUA (invalid). Not valid.

Option 5: T in 1, A in 2, and pick a letter that makes a valid word.
   1 2 3 4 5
   T A _ U _
Wait, we have T A _ U _. We need a letter for 3 that forms a valid word with these constraints. Let’s list possible 5-letter words with T A _ U _ pattern:
- T A U U _ (invalid, letters repeat)
- T A C U _ → TACU? (invalid)
- T A N U _ → TANU? (invalid)
- T A M U _ → TAMU? (invalid)
- T A P U _ → TAPU? (invalid)
- T A L U _ → TALU? (invalid)

This path seems stuck. Maybe try T in 3, A in 2 or 5 with better letter choices.

Option 6: Look for valid English words fitting _ A T U _ or _ _ T U A.
Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words with U in 4th position and T and A somewhere else (not in their previous disallowed spots):

Words with U in 4th:
- FAULT (F, A, U, L, T) – but A is in 2 (allowed), T is in 5 (from ABOUT feedback, T was in position 5? Wait, in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and got ""-"", so T cannot be in 5. So FAULT has T in 5 → invalid.
- CAPUT (C, A, P, U, T) – T is in 5 → invalid.
- VAULT (V, A, U, L, T) – T in 5 → invalid.
- MAGUS (M, A, G, U, S) – S is banned → invalid.
- TABUN (T, A, B, U, N) – B is banned → invalid.
- DATUM (D, A, T, U, M) – T is in 3 (allowed), A is in 2 (allowed), U is in 4 (correct), M is new. This seems valid: D A T U M.

Check constraints:
- Letters used: D, A, T, U, M – none are banned (S, R, E, B, O are banned).
- U is correctly in 4th position (✓).
- T is in 3rd position (not in 2 or 5, so allowed).
- A is in 2nd position (not in 1 or 3, so allowed).

DATUM is a valid 5-letter word. Let’s choose this.
</think>

Based on the previous feedback, the word must contain **T**, **A**, and **U** (with **U** fixed in position 4), and must exclude **S, R, E, B, O**. The positions ruled out so far are:
- **T** cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- **A** cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

The only remaining arrangement that forms a valid English word is **DATUM**.

   1 2 3 4 5
   _ A T U _
Need letters for 1 and 5. Missing letters: must avoid S, R, E, B, O. Let’s pick C for 1 and H for 5: C A T U H → CATUH (not valid). Or pick L for 1 and D for 5: L A T U D → LATUD (nope). Or M for 1 and N for 5: M A T U N → MATUN (invalid). Not getting good words.

Option 3: T in 3, A in 5.
   1 2 3 4 5
   _ _ T U A
Need letters for 1 and 2. Pick from remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let’s pick C and H: C H T U A → CHTUA (invalid). Or C and L: C L T U A → CLTUA (invalid). Or N and D: N D T U A → NDTUA (invalid). Or H and I: H I T U A → HITUA (invalid). Or M and I: M I T U A → MITUA (invalid). Not working.

Option 4: T in 1, A in 5.
   1 2 3 4 5
   T _ _ U A
Need letters for 2 and 3. Pick from remaining common letters. Let’s pick I and N: T I N U A → TINUA (invalid). Or D and I: T D I U A → TDIUA (invalid). Or C and H: T C H U A → TCHUA (invalid). Or M and I: T M I U A → TMIUA (invalid). Not valid.

Option 5: T in 1, A in 2, and pick a letter that makes a valid word.
   1 2 3 4 5
   T A _ U _
Wait, we have T A _ U _. We need a letter for 3 that forms a valid word with these constraints. Let’s list possible 5-letter words with T A _ U _ pattern:
- T A U U _ (invalid, letters repeat)
- T A C U _ → TACU? (invalid)
- T A N U _ → TANU? (invalid)
- T A M U _ → TAMU? (invalid)
- T A P U _ → TAPU? (invalid)
- T A L U _ → TALU? (invalid)

This path seems stuck. Maybe try T in 3, A in 2 or 5 with better letter choices.

Option 6: Look for valid English words fitting _ A T U _ or _ _ T U A.
Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words with U in 4th position and T and A somewhere else (not in their previous disallowed spots):

Words with U in 4th:
- FAULT (F, A, U, L, T) – but A is in 2 (allowed), T is in 5 (from ABOUT feedback, T was in position 5? Wait, in ABOUT, T was in position 5 and got ""-"", so T cannot be in 5. So FAULT has T in 5 → invalid.
- CAPUT (C, A, P, U, T) – T is in 5 → invalid.
- VAULT (V, A, U, L, T) – T in 5 → invalid.
- MAGUS (M, A, G, U, S) – S is banned → invalid.
- TABUN (T, A, B, U, N) – B is banned → invalid.
- DATUM (D, A, T, U, M) – T is in 3 (allowed), A is in 2 (allowed), U is in 4 (correct), M is new. This seems valid: D A T U M.

Check constraints:
- Letters used: D, A, T, U, M – none are banned (S, R, E, B, O are banned).
- U is correctly in 4th position (✓).
- T is in 3rd position (not in 2 or 5, so allowed).
- A is in 2nd position (not in 1 or 3, so allowed).

DATUM is a valid 5-letter word. Let’s choose this.Based on the previous feedback, the word must contain **T**, **A**, and **U** (with **U** fixed in position 4), and must exclude **S, R, E, B, O**. The positions ruled out so far are:
- **T** cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- **A** cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

The only remaining arrangement that forms a valid English word is **DATUM**.",Guess 3: DATUM -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) A(✓) T(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
