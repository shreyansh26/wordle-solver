For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (like A and E).
2. Include common consonants (like R, S, T).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as an optimal starting guess because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant.
- A: Common vowel.
- I: Common vowel.
- S: Very common consonant.
- E: Most common vowel.

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- A is in the correct position (second letter).  
- R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the target word has the pattern:  
_  A  _  _  _

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A as its second letter.
- Contains none of R, I, S, or E.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (all consonants except R and S, and vowels except I and E are still possible; O and U are the unused vowels).

A strong next step is to test new common consonants (T, N, L) together with the remaining vowels.  
The word “MOUNT” satisfies:
- Second letter is A? No – so reject.  
Try “CANDY” – second letter A, no R, I, S, or E, and adds common letters C, N, D, Y.  
However, CANDY has D and Y which are plausible.

A simpler, high-frequency word that fits the constraints is “CANDY”.  
But let me pick an even more common one: PLANT  
- P : ok  
- L : ok  
- A : in correct spot  
- N : ok  
- T : ok  
No R, I, S, or E, and A is in position 2.

Thus PLANT is a good second guess.

We also need common letters to maximize information.  
Good candidates:  
- Use N somewhere in positions 1,3,4  
- Try to check new common consonants (D, G, M, K, etc.)

Let’s list high-frequency words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain N, while avoiding all banned letters.

Example candidates:

- MANGO – O is allowed, M, N, G are still possible.
- CANNY – repeats N, but N is allowed once; Y is allowed.
- DANNY – same issue with double N.
- HANDS – S is banned.
- BANKS – S is banned.
- FANCY – F, N, C, Y are allowed.
- HANGS – S is banned.

Among these, MANGO looks good:
- M (new consonant)
- A (in correct position)
- N (must be in word, currently in position 3)
- G (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)

But wait – N is in position 3 here. The feedback from PLANT said N is in the word but NOT in position 5. It didn’t say it’s not in position 3, so that’s okay.

Similarly, FANCY is also good:
- F (new consonant)
- A (correct position)
- N (in position 3)
- C (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel)

Both are reasonable. Between them, MANGO tests the new vowel O and consonants M, G.

- Try to check new common consonants (D, G, M, K, etc.)

Let’s list high-frequency words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain N, while avoiding all banned letters.

Example candidates:
- BANJO – contains J (less common), and O.
- MANGO – O is allowed, M, N, G are still possible.
- CANNY – repeats N, but N is allowed once; Y is allowed.
- DANNY – same issue with double N.
- HANDS – S is banned.
- BANKS – S is banned.
- FANCY – F, N, C, Y are allowed.
- HANGS – S is banned.

Among these, MANGO looks good:
- M (new consonant)
- A (in correct position)
- N (must be in word, currently in position 3)
- G (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)

But wait – N is in position 3 here. The feedback from PLANT said N is in the word but NOT in position 5. It didn’t say it’s not in position 3, so that’s okay.

Similarly, FANCY is also good:
- F (new consonant)
- A (correct position)
- N (in position 3)
- C (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel)

Both are reasonable. Between them, MANGO tests the new vowel O and consonants M, G.  
However, we still need to check if any letter positions conflict with prior feedback – none do.

I’ll go with MANGO.

Common English words fitting that pattern:

The only reasonably common word left is “DANG Y” → but “dangy” is uncommon/obsolete.

Next, let’s look at “CANG” – nothing there.  
“BANG” with a final letter: BANG_ — none valid except BANGS (S banned).

Wait: we’re forgetting that position 5 just needs a letter that’s allowed and makes a valid word. The only remaining common consonant with A-N-G is:

FAN — pattern is _ A N G _  
Let’s try “FANG _” – FANGS is invalid (S banned), FANGY is rare.  

Another angle: “HANG” – HANGS invalid, HANGY rare.

“BAND” is out – D is allowed but pattern is _ A N G _.

Let’s look in a dictionary list for _ANG_ with no banned letters:

- DANGY (rare)
- BANGY (rare)
- CANG? → nothing
- KANG? → nothing
- HANG? → needs a final letter

Actually, one valid common word remains: “HANGS” but S banned.  
Another: “VANGS” – invalid.

Wait – “WANG” is invalid.  
We have to pick a valid dictionary word with the fixed A-N-G in positions 2-4 and remaining letters from the allowed set.

Rechecking allowed final letters: we can use B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A real word: “BAND” – but pattern is _ A N G _.  
The word must be 5 letters ending in G? No, pattern is _ A N G _ — G is 4th letter.

Wait, let’s list known dictionary words that match ?ANG? and avoid banned letters:

Possible candidates:
- BANGY – uncommon but valid
- DANGS – invalid (S banned)
- FANGS – invalid
- HANGS – invalid
- KANGS – invalid, also K A N G S
- VANGS – invalid

MANGS – M banned  
VANGS – invalid  
SANGS – S banned  

We are missing a valid common word. Let’s look at the lexicon of 5-letter words that fit _ANG_ exactly:

Turns out there is one common word: “BANGY” (meaning like a banging sound) – but it’s uncommon.

Another: “DANGY” – obsolete.

The only solid remaining candidate that we can be confident is in standard Wordle wordlists is “BANGY”. Although rare, it is the only remaining possible English word fitting all constraints.

Given the constraints, the best next guess is “BANGY”.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, A, N, G, Y – none of these letters are banned (B and Y not yet eliminated), and positions 2-4 are A N G.

Yes, it fits.

So we will guess BANGY.

However, to maximize the chance of hitting a more common word, and since Y is not yet fully confirmed, another rare but valid word exists: “CANGY” – but not valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (like A and E).
2. Include common consonants (like R, S, T).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as an optimal starting guess because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant.
- A: Common vowel.
- I: Common vowel.
- S: Very common consonant.
- E: Most common vowel.

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- A is in the correct position (second letter).  
- R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the target word has the pattern:  
_  A  _  _  _

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A as its second letter.
- Contains none of R, I, S, or E.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (all consonants except R and S, and vowels except I and E are still possible; O and U are the unused vowels).

A strong next step is to test new common consonants (T, N, L) together with the remaining vowels.  
The word “MOUNT” satisfies:
- Second letter is A? No – so reject.  
Try “CANDY” – second letter A, no R, I, S, or E, and adds common letters C, N, D, Y.  
However, CANDY has D and Y which are plausible.

A simpler, high-frequency word that fits the constraints is “CANDY”.  
But let me pick an even more common one: PLANT  
- P : ok  
- L : ok  
- A : in correct spot  
- N : ok  
- T : ok  
No R, I, S, or E, and A is in position 2.

Thus PLANT is a good second guess.

Allowed letters (everything except the eliminated ones):
Vowels: A (already used), O, U, Y
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

We know N is somewhere in the word, but not at position 5.  
We also need common letters to maximize information.  
Good candidates:  
- Use N somewhere in positions 1,3,4  
- Try to check new common consonants (D, G, M, K, etc.)

Let’s list high-frequency words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain N, while avoiding all banned letters.

Example candidates:

Among these, MANGO looks good:
- M (new consonant)

- N (must be in word, currently in position 3)
- G (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)

But wait – N is in position 3 here. The feedback from PLANT said N is in the word but NOT in position 5. It didn’t say it’s not in position 3, so that’s okay.

Similarly, FANCY is also good:

Both are reasonable. Between them, MANGO tests the new vowel O and consonants M, G.

Common English words fitting that pattern:

Next, let’s look at “CANG” – nothing there.  
“BANG” with a final letter: BANG_ — none valid except BANGS (S banned).

Wait: we’re forgetting that position 5 just needs a letter that’s allowed and makes a valid word. The only remaining common consonant with A-N-G is:

FAN — pattern is _ A N G _  
Let’s try “FANG _” – FANGS is invalid (S banned), FANGY is rare.  

Another angle: “HANG” – HANGS invalid, HANGY rare.

“BAND” is out – D is allowed but pattern is _ A N G _.

Let’s look in a dictionary list for _ANG_ with no banned letters:

- DANGY (rare)

- CANG? → nothing
- KANG? → nothing
- HANG? → needs a final letter

Actually, one valid common word remains: “HANGS” but S banned.  
Another: “VANGS” – invalid.

Wait – “WANG” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list known dictionary words that match ?ANG? and avoid banned letters:

We are missing a valid common word. Let’s look at the lexicon of 5-letter words that fit _ANG_ exactly:

Turns out there is one common word: “BANGY” (meaning like a banging sound) – but it’s uncommon.

Another: “DANGY” – obsolete.

The only solid remaining candidate that we can be confident is in standard Wordle wordlists is “BANGY”. Although rare, it is the only remaining possible English word fitting all constraints.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, A, N, G, Y – none of these letters are banned (B and Y not yet eliminated), and positions 2-4 are A N G.

Yes, it fits.

So we will guess BANGY.

However, to maximize the chance of hitting a more common word, and since Y is not yet fully confirmed, another rare but valid word exists: “CANGY” – but not valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (like A and E).
2. Include common consonants (like R, S, T).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as an optimal starting guess because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant.
- A: Common vowel.
- I: Common vowel.
- S: Very common consonant.
- E: Most common vowel.

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- A is in the correct position (second letter).  
- R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the target word has the pattern:  
_  A  _  _  _

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A as its second letter.
- Contains none of R, I, S, or E.
- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (all consonants except R and S, and vowels except I and E are still possible; O and U are the unused vowels).

A strong next step is to test new common consonants (T, N, L) together with the remaining vowels.  
The word “MOUNT” satisfies:
- Second letter is A? No – so reject.  
Try “CANDY” – second letter A, no R, I, S, or E, and adds common letters C, N, D, Y.  
However, CANDY has D and Y which are plausible.

A simpler, high-frequency word that fits the constraints is “CANDY”.  
But let me pick an even more common one: PLANT  
- P : ok  
- L : ok  
- A : in correct spot  
- N : ok  
- T : ok  
No R, I, S, or E, and A is in position 2.

Thus PLANT is a good second guess.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:

3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
   A (already fixed in position 2),
   N (somewhere other than position 5),
   A repeats but is already accounted for.

So far we have:

Positions: 1   2   3   4   5
Letters:   ?   A   ?   ?   ?

Allowed letters (everything except the eliminated ones):
Vowels: A (already used), O, U, Y
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

We know N is somewhere in the word, but not at position 5.  
We also need common letters to maximize information.  
Good candidates:  
- Use N somewhere in positions 1,3,4  
- Try to check new common consonants (D, G, M, K, etc.)

Let’s list high-frequency words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain N, while avoiding all banned letters.

Example candidates:
- BANJO – contains J (less common), and O.
- MANGO – O is allowed, M, N, G are still possible.
- CANNY – repeats N, but N is allowed once; Y is allowed.
- DANNY – same issue with double N.
- HANDS – S is banned.
- BANKS – S is banned.
- FANCY – F, N, C, Y are allowed.
- HANGS – S is banned.

Among these, MANGO looks good:
- M (new consonant)
- A (in correct position)
- N (must be in word, currently in position 3)
- G (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)

But wait – N is in position 3 here. The feedback from PLANT said N is in the word but NOT in position 5. It didn’t say it’s not in position 3, so that’s okay.

Similarly, FANCY is also good:
- F (new consonant)
- A (correct position)
- N (in position 3)
- C (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel)

Both are reasonable. Between them, MANGO tests the new vowel O and consonants M, G.  
However, we still need to check if any letter positions conflict with prior feedback – none do.

I’ll go with MANGO.

B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter English word of the form  
? A N G ?

Common English words fitting that pattern:
- BANGS  → S is banned
- DANGS  → S is banned
- FANGS  → S is banned
- HANGS  → S is banned
- BANGY  → Y is allowed, but “bangy” is uncommon
- BANGL  → Not valid
- CANG?  → Nothing real
- WAND?  → Pattern mismatch
- KANG?  → Nothing real
- DANG?  → Needs a final letter

The only reasonably common word left is “DANG Y” → but “dangy” is uncommon/obsolete.

Next, let’s look at “CANG” – nothing there.  
“BANG” with a final letter: BANG_ — none valid except BANGS (S banned).

Wait: we’re forgetting that position 5 just needs a letter that’s allowed and makes a valid word. The only remaining common consonant with A-N-G is:

FAN — pattern is _ A N G _  
Let’s try “FANG _” – FANGS is invalid (S banned), FANGY is rare.  

Another angle: “HANG” – HANGS invalid, HANGY rare.

“BAND” is out – D is allowed but pattern is _ A N G _.

Let’s look in a dictionary list for _ANG_ with no banned letters:

- DANGY (rare)
- BANGY (rare)
- CANG? → nothing
- KANG? → nothing
- HANG? → needs a final letter

Actually, one valid common word remains: “HANGS” but S banned.  
Another: “VANGS” – invalid.

Wait – “WANG” is invalid.  
We have to pick a valid dictionary word with the fixed A-N-G in positions 2-4 and remaining letters from the allowed set.

Rechecking allowed final letters: we can use B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A real word: “BAND” – but pattern is _ A N G _.  
The word must be 5 letters ending in G? No, pattern is _ A N G _ — G is 4th letter.

Wait, let’s list known dictionary words that match ?ANG? and avoid banned letters:

Possible candidates:
- BANGY – uncommon but valid
- DANGS – invalid (S banned)
- FANGS – invalid
- HANGS – invalid
- KANGS – invalid, also K A N G S
- VANGS – invalid
- WANGS – invalid
- CANG? – nothing

Actually, one solid candidate remains: “CANDY” – but pattern is _ A N G _ and D is allowed. Wait, CANDY has C A N D Y – that’s _ A N _ _. Not matching.

Look again at pattern _ A N G _.

Real words:  
BANGS – invalid  
HANGS – invalid  
GANGS – G already in place, plus S banned  
FANGS – invalid  
DANGS – invalid  
MANGS – M banned  
VANGS – invalid  
SANGS – S banned  

We are missing a valid common word. Let’s look at the lexicon of 5-letter words that fit _ANG_ exactly:

Turns out there is one common word: “BANGY” (meaning like a banging sound) – but it’s uncommon.

Another: “DANGY” – obsolete.

The only solid remaining candidate that we can be confident is in standard Wordle wordlists is “BANGY”. Although rare, it is the only remaining possible English word fitting all constraints.

Given the constraints, the best next guess is “BANGY”.

But wait – let’s double-check: B, A, N, G, Y – none of these letters are banned (B and Y not yet eliminated), and positions 2-4 are A N G.

Yes, it fits.

So we will guess BANGY.

However, to maximize the chance of hitting a more common word, and since Y is not yet fully confirmed, another rare but valid word exists: “CANGY” – but not valid.

Actually, upon rechecking, the only remaining valid English word is “BANGY”.

Include common consonants (like R, S, T).\n3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nThe word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as an optimal starting guess because it includes:\n- R: Very common consonant.\n- A: Common vowel.\n- I: Common vowel.\n- S: Very common consonant.\n- E: Most common vowel.\n\nThis combination gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- A is in the correct position (second letter).  \n- R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the target word has the pattern:  \n_  A  _  _  _\n\nWe now need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has A as its second letter.\n- Contains none of R, I, S, or E.\n- Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (all consonants except R and S, and vowels except I and E are still possible; O and U are the unused vowels).\n\nA strong next step is to test new common consonants (T, N, L) together with the remaining vowels.  \nThe word “MOUNT” satisfies:\n- Second letter is A?
