For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word should contain common letters in English and ideally cover some vowels and consonants. A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for my next guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, O  
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

I need a word that contains both A and O, avoids R, S, E, and places A and O in new positions.  
A good next candidate is ALOFT, because:
- It contains A and O.
- It does not contain R, S, E.
- A is in position 1 (we already know A is not in position 1, but this guess will help check A in a different spot).
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE).

Another candidate is ADOBO, but that repeats O. A more balanced candidate is ABODE, but it has E, which we know is not in the word. The best valid candidate seems to be ALOFT.

From the two guesses so far we have:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, L, F, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from ALOFT) – same position, no new info here.  
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from ALOFT) – same position, no new info here.  

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O.  
2. Contains none of R, S, E, L, F, T.  
3. Places A in positions 2-5 and O in positions 1,2,4,5 (anywhere except 3).  

Viable remaining letters: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we only need 3 more besides A and O).  

We want the next guess to place A and O in new spots and introduce three fresh, common letters to maximize information.  
A good candidate is “ABOMA”:
- A appears (but we know A is already in the word and this would test it in position 1 again, which we know is wrong).  
Instead, let’s try “ABOMA” but skip repeating A. Another good candidate is “ABOON” but that repeats O and uses N which is fine.  

Actually, a clean choice is “ADORN” but that contains R and N (R is already out).  

Let’s list possible 5-letter words using A, O plus three other unused letters, avoiding positions 1 for A and 3 for O.  
A very common word that fits is “ABODE” but it has E and D (E is out).  

“ACORN” has R and N – R is out.  

“AMONG” has M, N, G – all okay, and no forbidden letters, and no repeats.  
- A in position 1 – we know is wrong. Skip.  

“ANCHO” – has C, H, N. But O is in position 4 – okay, A is in position 1 – wrong.  

“BACON” – B, C, N, A in position 2, O in position 4. This looks good:
- Contains A (position 2) and O (position 4).  
- Letters B, C, N have not been tested yet.  
- No forbidden letters R, S, E, L, F, T.  

So “BACON” is a strong next guess.

We now know a lot:

- Letters in the word and their positions so far:
  – B is correct in position 1.
  – A is correct in position 2.
  – O is correct in position 4.

- Letters NOT in the word (from the three guesses):
  – R, S, E, L, F, T, C, N

So the pattern so far is:

B A _ O _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “BA”, has “O” in position 4, and whose third and fifth letters are from the unused alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Unused letters that remain (without R, S, E, L, F, T, C, N) include: D, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to pick two letters for positions 3 and 5 from these remaining letters, forming a valid English word.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words that fit “BA _ O _”:

- BADOG (not a word)
- BAGOT (not a word)
- BAHOO (not a word)
- BAIKO (not a word)
- BAJOU (not a word)
- BAKOO (not a word)
- BALOO (but L is out)
- BAMBO (not a word)
- BANGO (G is available, but BANGO is not in common dictionaries)
- BAPOO (not a word)
- BARON (R, N are out)
- BASHO (S, H are out)
- BATON (T, N are out)
- BAYOU (Y, U are available – this is a valid word: “BAYOU”)

Let’s verify BAYOU:
- B is in position 1 (matches ✓)
- A is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- Y is a new letter, not yet tested
- O is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- U is a new letter, not yet tested
- No forbidden letters are used.

Thus, BAYOU is a valid next guess.
