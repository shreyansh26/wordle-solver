Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a strategic starting word. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words.
2. Avoid repeating any letters to maximize information gain.
3. Include both vowels and consonants.

Based on letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are: e, a, r, o, t, l, n, s, i, c. The word ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these most common letters (a, r, o, s, e) and has no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance of getting hits on multiple letters right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so not position 4).
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letter set: must include O and S.
- Position 3 is O.
- Position 4 is NOT S.

To make the best second guess, I’ll choose a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Includes S somewhere except position 4.
3. Uses none of the excluded letters A, R, E.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Popular consonants not yet ruled out: L, N, T, I, C, D, G, etc.
Popular vowels left: I, U (since O is already known).

Looking at common 5-letter patterns, a word like “FOIST” fits:
- Uses O in position 3.
- Uses S not in position 4 (it’s in position 1).
- Uses none of A, R, E.
- Introduces F, I, T for new information.

Important deductions from the two clues so far:

1. Position 3 must be **O** (✓ from Guess 1) – but in Guess 2 the same letter **O** is reported as “-” (wrong position).  
   That is a contradiction: O cannot be both “correct position 3” and “wrong position 3”.  
   The only logical conclusion is that **O appears more than once** in the secret word: at least one O is correctly in position 3 and at least one other O is elsewhere.

Known facts now:
- O is in position 3.
- O appears **at least one more time** elsewhere in the word (because of the “-” on Guess 2).
- S is in the word but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and 2).
- T is in the word and in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, F, I.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ T, with an extra O somewhere and an S somewhere among positions 2 or 4.

Good candidate words:
- JOLLY – contains J, L, L, Y.  Needs O twice and S, so no.
- MOOSE – has O twice and an S, and keeps T at position 5.  All letters allowed.
- BOOTS – has double O, keeps T at 5, and S in position 4 (allowed since S cannot be in 1 or 4 only in prior guesses, not absolute).

BOOTS satisfies every constraint:
  B _ O O T
  S must fit in position 2 (allowed), but we don’t have confirmation yet where S is – the word only requires S to be somewhere, not necessarily every slot.

Hence, **BOOTS** is a strong next guess.

Let me reconcile all the feedback so far.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A(x), R(x), E(x)  → none of A, R, E is in the word.
- O(✓)               → position 3 is O and it is correct.
- S(-)               → S is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (FOIST):
- F(x), I(x)         → F and I are not in the word.
- O(-)               → O is in the word but in the wrong **spot**.  
  The only position O could be in Guess 2 was position 2, so O is NOT in position 2.
- S(-)               → S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (because those are where S appeared in Guess 2 and was marked “-”).
- T(✓)               → position 5 is T and it is correct.

From Guess 3 (BOOTS):
- B(x)               → B is not in the word.
- O(-)               → O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already knew) and also NOT in position 1 (because that’s where it appeared in Guess 3).
- O(✓)               → position 3 is O (confirms earlier info).
- T(-)               → T is in the word but in the wrong position.  But we already know from Guess 2 that position 5 is T, so this mark is consistent: T is in position 5, so any other T would be “-”.
- S(-)               → S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (all positions where S appeared in prior guesses).  
  That is impossible—every position has been ruled out for S—so the only logical resolution is that **S appears exactly once** and the feedback indicators simply forbid those specific positions in those specific guesses.  The one un-forbidden spot left for S is position 1.

So we now have:
- Pattern: S _ O _ T
- Forbidden letters so far: A, B, E, F, I, R
- Allowed consonants left: C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Allowed vowels left: U (O is already used in position 3)

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting **S _ O _ T** with no forbidden letters and only allowed vowels, the most common is **SHOUT** (but we ruled out U earlier? No, U was not ruled out).  Let me check:
- S H O U T
- Letters used: S, H, O, U, T.  All are allowed; none were marked x so far.

That looks valid.
