Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some popular choices are: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, or RAISE. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- S, T (very common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- L (moderately common)
And all letters are unique.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ E
- Contains letters: A (somewhere other than position 3), L (position 2), E (position 5)
- Does not contain: S, T

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has L in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Has A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, but not 3).
3. Avoids S and T.
4. Uses common remaining letters (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- A L _ _ E → but A can’t be in position 1 because that would make A the first letter, and we have no info against it, but we want A not in position 3.
- _ L A _ E → A in position 3 is invalid (feedback says A is not in position 3)
- _ L _ A E → A in position 4 is allowed
- A L _ A E → A in position 1 and 4 → but A can’t be in position 3, so this is allowed, but double A might not be optimal.

Good candidate: C L A N E → but N is common, and this uses C, L, A, N, E.
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B L A Z E → but Z is less common and A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: F L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L A C E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: G L A R E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: M A L L E → but L is already in position 2, and double L would waste a letter, plus A in position 2 is invalid (L must be there).

Next candidate: C L I N E → but A must be present somewhere (from feedback), and this doesn’t include A. So invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: D L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L E A D → but E is in position 3, but we know E is in position 5. Invalid.

Next candidate: P L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: L A R G E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C L A M P → but E must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C R A N E → L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: R A D L E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C A P L E → but E must be in position 5, and L in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B A L L E → L must be in position 2, E in position 5, and A must appear somewhere (not position 3). So A could be in position 1 or 4. 

Let’s try A L O N E:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (✓)
- O: new letter
- N: new letter
- E in position 5 (✓)
This fits all constraints: no S or T, contains A, L in position 2, E in position 5, and A is in position 1 (not 3).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter = A
   - 2nd letter = L
   - 5th letter = E
   So the pattern so far is:  A L _ _ E

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   S, T, O, N (and obviously any already eliminated letters).

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   None additional beyond A, L, E (which are already locked into positions 1, 2, 5).

4. Remaining positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not yet ruled out**.
   Common remaining consonants: R, D, G, M, P, C, B, V, F, K, etc.
   Vowels still possible: I, U (since A, E are already used).

5. To maximize information we want to test a new common letter in each remaining position while keeping the known fixed letters.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words matching A L _ _ E:

- ALIKE  (I in 3, K in 4) – uses I, K
- ALIVE  (already tried; O and N were rejected, but V is still possible)
- ALURE  (U in 3, R in 4) – uses U, R
- ALDRE  (not a valid word)
- ALGIE  (G, I)
- ALDIE  (D, I)

“ALIKE” stands out because:
   – I and K are both new letters.
   – I is a common vowel we haven’t used yet.
   – K is a moderately common consonant we haven’t used yet.

Therefore, ALIKE is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

2. Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some popular choices are: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, or RAISE. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ E
- Contains letters: A (somewhere other than position 3), L (position 2), E (position 5)
- Does not contain: S, T

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has L in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Has A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, but not 3).
3. Avoids S and T.
4. Uses common remaining letters (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- A L _ _ E → but A can’t be in position 1 because that would make A the first letter, and we have no info against it, but we want A not in position 3.
- _ L A _ E → A in position 3 is invalid (feedback says A is not in position 3)
- _ L _ A E → A in position 4 is allowed
- A L _ A E → A in position 1 and 4 → but A can’t be in position 3, so this is allowed, but double A might not be optimal.

Good candidate: C L A N E → but N is common, and this uses C, L, A, N, E.
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B L A Z E → but Z is less common and A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: F L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L A C E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: G L A R E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: M A L L E → but L is already in position 2, and double L would waste a letter, plus A in position 2 is invalid (L must be there).

Next candidate: C L I N E → but A must be present somewhere (from feedback), and this doesn’t include A. So invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: D L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L E A D → but E is in position 3, but we know E is in position 5. Invalid.

Next candidate: P L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: L A R G E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: B L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: C L A M P → but E must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C R A N E → L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: G L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L E A K → E is in position 3, but must be in position 5. Invalid.

Next candidate: F L A K E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: C L A P E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: F L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L O C K → does not contain A. Invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: R A D L E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C A P L E → but E must be in position 5, and L in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B A L L E → L must be in position 2, E in position 5, and A must appear somewhere (not position 3). So A could be in position 1 or 4. 

Let’s try A L O N E:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (✓)
- O: new letter
- N: new letter
- E in position 5 (✓)
This fits all constraints: no S or T, contains A, L in position 2, E in position 5, and A is in position 1 (not 3).

Another candidate: A L I V E:
- A in position 1
- L in position 2
- I, V, E
But V is less common.

A L O N E seems better.

1. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (E, A, I, O, U)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some popular choices are: SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, or RAISE. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- S, T (very common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- L (moderately common)
And all letters are unique.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ E
- Contains letters: A (somewhere other than position 3), L (position 2), E (position 5)
- Does not contain: S, T

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has L in position 2 and E in position 5.
2. Has A somewhere else (positions 1, 4, but not 3).
3. Avoids S and T.
4. Uses common remaining letters (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- A L _ _ E → but A can’t be in position 1 because that would make A the first letter, and we have no info against it, but we want A not in position 3.
- _ L A _ E → A in position 3 is invalid (feedback says A is not in position 3)
- _ L _ A E → A in position 4 is allowed
- A L _ A E → A in position 1 and 4 → but A can’t be in position 3, so this is allowed, but double A might not be optimal.

Good candidate: C L A N E → but N is common, and this uses C, L, A, N, E.
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- A is in position 3 → but feedback says A is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B L A Z E → but Z is less common and A is in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: F L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L A C E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: G L A R E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: M A L L E → but L is already in position 2, and double L would waste a letter, plus A in position 2 is invalid (L must be there).

Next candidate: C L I N E → but A must be present somewhere (from feedback), and this doesn’t include A. So invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: D L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: P L E A D → but E is in position 3, but we know E is in position 5. Invalid.

Next candidate: P L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: L A R G E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: B L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: C L A M P → but E must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C R A N E → L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: G L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L E A K → E is in position 3, but must be in position 5. Invalid.

Next candidate: F L A K E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: C L A P E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: F L A M E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: B L O C K → does not contain A. Invalid.

Next candidate: C L A N E → A in position 3 (invalid).

Next candidate: R A D L E → but L must be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: C A P L E → but E must be in position 5, and L in position 2. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: B A L L E → L must be in position 2, E in position 5, and A must appear somewhere (not position 3). So A could be in position 1 or 4. 

Let’s try A L O N E:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (✓)
- O: new letter
- N: new letter
- E in position 5 (✓)
This fits all constraints: no S or T, contains A, L in position 2, E in position 5, and A is in position 1 (not 3).

Another candidate: A L I V E:
- A in position 1
- L in position 2
- I, V, E
But V is less common.

A L O N E seems better.

Final choice: A L O N E

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALONE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 1st letter = A
   - 2nd letter = L
   - 5th letter = E
   So the pattern so far is:  A L _ _ E

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   S, T, O, N (and obviously any already eliminated letters).

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   None additional beyond A, L, E (which are already locked into positions 1, 2, 5).

4. Remaining positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not yet ruled out**.
   Common remaining consonants: R, D, G, M, P, C, B, V, F, K, etc.
   Vowels still possible: I, U (since A, E are already used).

5. To maximize information we want to test a new common letter in each remaining position while keeping the known fixed letters.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words matching A L _ _ E:

- ALIKE  (I in 3, K in 4) – uses I, K
- ALIVE  (already tried; O and N were rejected, but V is still possible)
- ALURE  (U in 3, R in 4) – uses U, R
- ALDRE  (not a valid word)
- ALGIE  (G, I)
- ALDIE  (D, I)

“ALIKE” stands out because:
   – I and K are both new letters.
   – I is a common vowel we haven’t used yet.
   – K is a moderately common consonant we haven’t used yet.

Therefore, ALIKE is a strong next guess.

Guess 3: ALIKE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now have the following locked information:

1. Positions fixed:
   - 1st letter = A
   - 2nd letter = L
   - 5th letter = E
   Pattern: A L _ _ E

2. Letters ruled out completely:
   S, T, O, N, I, K (plus any others not yet used)

3. Remaining possible letters (for positions 3 and 4):
   Consonants not yet used: R, D, G, M, P, C, B, V, F, W, Y, H, etc.
   Vowels not yet used: U (since A and E are already placed)

We need a common 5-letter word that matches A L _ _ E, uses only still-allowed letters, and helps us test new letters efficiently.

Possible candidates:
- ALURE  (U in 3, R in 4)
- ALGAE  (G in 3, A in 4 – but A is already used in position 1)
- ALDER  (D in 3, R in 4)
- ALGIE  (but I is out)
- ALBEE  (double E – but E is fixed at position 5)
- ALBUM  (doesn't fit _ _ _ _ E)

""ALDER"" is a valid word:
- A(1), L(2), D(3), R(4), E(5)
- Uses new letters D and R, both common and not yet eliminated.

From the four rounds we now have:

Fixed positions:

Letters definitely **not** in the word:
S, T, O, N, I, K, D, R

Letters we know **are** in the word but whose exact spot is still unknown:
E (but we already have E locked in position 5)

That leaves positions 3 and 4 to fill with letters **not yet ruled out**.
Remaining consonants: C, G, M, P, B, V, F, W, Y, H, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (A & E already placed, O, I ruled out)

Valid English words of the form A L _ _ E with no disallowed letters:
- ALGAE  (G in 3, A in 4 – but A already in position 1, and double A isn’t useful)
- ALUME  (U in 3, M in 4) – spell-check says “alume” is a variant spelling of “alum,” recognized in some dictionaries.
- ALGAE: A already used in position 1, so 4th letter A would be duplicate – not helpful.

Between commonness and testing new letters, “ALGAE” is the safer, widely accepted word, even though it repeats A in position 4; G is still untested and legal.
