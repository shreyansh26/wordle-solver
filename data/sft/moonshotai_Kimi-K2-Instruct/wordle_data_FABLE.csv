For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters and good letter coverage. The classic starting words often include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at common starting words, some good options are:
- SLATE (good coverage with S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but poor consonants)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (another vowel)

This gives me exposure to 5 very common letters in positions that might help identify the correct placement early.

This means selecting a word with common letters and good letter coverage. The classic starting words often include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. \n\nLooking at common starting words, some good options are:\n- SLATE (good coverage with S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (many vowels but poor consonants)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:\n- R (very common)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- I (another vowel)\n- S (very common)\n- E (another vowel)\n\nThis gives me exposure to 5 very common letters in positions that might help identify the correct placement early.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- A is in the word and in position 2 (✓)\n- I is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)\n\nSo the pattern so far: _ A _ _ E  \nWe know:\n- No R, I, S\n- A is second letter\n- E is last letter\n\nNext I’ll pick a word that fits this pattern but tries new, common letters in positions 1, 3, and 4.

From Guess 3 we now know:

- C is not in the word (x).
- A is correct in position 2 (✓).
- B is correct in position 3 (✓).
- L is correct in position 4 (✓).
- E is correct in position 5 (✓).

So the revealed pattern is:

_ A B L E

Only the first letter is unknown, and it must be a consonant that has not been eliminated yet.  
Letters already ruled out: R, I, S, P, T, C.  
Remaining plausible first-letter consonants (common English start letters): D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y.

We only need one more guess to hit the word. The most common starting consonants in five-letter words ending in “ABLE” are:

- D (DABLE is not a word)
- F (FABLE) – valid word
- G (GABLE) – valid word
- H (HABLE isn’t common)
- M (MABLE isn’t a word)
- N (NABLE isn’t a word)
- V (VABLE isn’t a word)
- W (WABLE isn’t a word)
- K (KABLE isn’t a word)

So the two chief candidates are FABLE and GABLE. Between these, FABLE is more frequent, so we’ll try FABLE first.
