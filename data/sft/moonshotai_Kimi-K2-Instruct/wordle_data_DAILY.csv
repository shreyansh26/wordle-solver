For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like ""S"", ""T"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""L"". 

A good choice would be ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word.
- It has two common consonants (R, S) which are also high-frequency letters in English.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, N, T are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T.
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, L.
  - A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  - L is not in position 2.

Therefore possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Other consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.
Remaining vowels: I, U.

- Introduce fresh common consonants.
- Keep the word common and easy to test.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like ""S"", ""T"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""L"". 

A good choice would be ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word.
- It has two common consonants (R, S) which are also high-frequency letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

Known so far:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
- The remaining unused common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W.
- The remaining unused vowels are: I, U (and Y sometimes).

Since A must appear somewhere, and we have ruled out five letters already, a good next guess would use a fresh set of common letters while placing A in one of the other four positions. A word like “UNTIL” won’t work because U and I could be in the word, but we need to test more consonants. A better choice is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants we haven’t tried.
- A is placed in position 2 to test it there.
- If the word contains any of P, L, N, T we’ll learn which; if not, we’ll rule them out.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, N, T are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, N, T.
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, L.
  - A is not in positions 1 or 3.
  - L is not in position 2.

Therefore possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Other consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.
Remaining vowels: I, U.

A good third guess should:
- Place A and L in new positions.
- Introduce fresh common consonants.
- Keep the word common and easy to test.

Let’s try “FLANK”:
- F and K are new consonants.
- L is in position 3 (new spot).
- A is in position 4 (new spot).
- N is already ruled out, so we need to change it.

Try “FLAM” is 4 letters; need 5.
Try “FLABI” – might not be a word.
Try “CLAMP” – P is out.
Try “CLAD” – 4 letters.
Try “BLACK”:
- B, C, K are new consonants.
- L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2).
Try “GLACK” – not a word.
Try “BLAZE” – contains Z and E (E is out).
Try “CLAIM” – I, M are new, but M is okay.
“CLAIM”:
- C, I, M are new.
- L in position 2 – but L cannot be in position 2 (from feedback).

Try “GLAZE” – has Z and E.
Try “FLACK” – but L cannot be in 2.
Try “FLUID” – has U, I, D; okay:
- F, U, I, D are new.
- L in position 2 – no.

Try “CALIX” – has X, not great.
Try “AMBLE” – has E, and A in position 1 (no).

Try “GLADY” – has Y, and A in 4 (new), L in 3 (new), D new, G new.
“GLADY”:
- G, L, A, D, Y – all new except A, L which we know are in word.
Positions:
- A in 4 (allowed).
- L in 3 (allowed).
Other letters: G, D, Y – new consonants.

But “GLADY” might not be a common word.
Try “GLAND” – but N is out.
Try “GLAM” – 4 letters.
Try “CLACK” – C, K, A, C, K – but C and K repeated.
Try “CLAMP” – P is out.
Try “FLAKY” – F, L, A, K, Y – but L in 2 (no).

Try “FLICK” – L in 2 (no).

Try “CHALK”:
- C, H, A, L, K.
- A in 3 – no, A cannot be in 3.
Try “CLASH” – A in 3 (no).

Try “FLINT” – N, T out.
Try “BLINK” – L in 2 (no).

Try “UMBRA” – U, M, B, R, A – R is out.

Try “BULKY” – no A.

Try “BAGEL” – E, G, L – E is out.

Try “VAULT” – U, V, L, T – T is out.

Try “VALVE” – E, V, V – E is out.

Try “VULVA” – V, U, L, V, A – A is in 5 (new), L in 3 (new), V, U new.

But “VULVA” is uncommon.

Try “MURAL” – M, U, R, A, L – R is out.

Try “MULCH” – M, U, L, C, H – A missing.

We need A and L together in allowed spots.

Best simple word seems “BLACK” but L in 2 is invalid.

Next option: “CLANK” – N is out.

Try “CLASH” – A in 3 (invalid).

Try “FLANK” – N is out.

Try “FLACK” – C, F, A, K – L missing.

Try “FLACK” is invalid.

Try “FLACK” is 5 letters: F, L, A, C, K.

Positions:
- A in 3 – invalid (from PLANT feedback, A not in 3).
So “FLACK” is invalid due to A in 3.

Try “FLACK” → A in 3 → invalid.

Try “FLACK” is invalid.

Try “FLACK” is invalid.

Try “FLACK” is invalid.

Try “FLACK” is invalid.

Thus, next possible word where A is not in 1 or 3:
A can be in 2, 4, 5.

L can be in 1, 3, 4, 5.

Let’s choose “BLIMP” – but no A.
Try “BLAZY” – has Z and A in 3 (invalid).

Try “BLOAT” – O, T out.

Try “GULAG” – G, U, L, A, G – A in 4 (ok), L in 3 (ok), G, U new.

But “GULAG” is uncommon.

Try “CAULK” – C, A, U, L, K – A in 2 (ok), L in 4 (ok), C, U, K new.

“CAULK” is a valid 5-letter word.

Check:
- C, A, U, L, K.
- A in 2 (allowed).
- L in 4 (allowed).
- C, U, K are new consonants/vowels.
- No excluded letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T).

Seems good.
