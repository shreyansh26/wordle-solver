For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me maximum information about the secret word. It's best to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good options include words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, L, S). A widely recommended first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels and two very common consonants. This should help me identify which letters are present and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers many common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's specifically designed to test vowels and common consonants efficiently.

Guess 2: AMISS → A(✓) M(x) I(x) S(✓) S(-)

Key facts:
1. The word begins with A.
2. S is in the word, but must appear exactly once (because in AMISS the first S at position 4 got ✓ while the second at position 5 got -, indicating only one S is accepted).
3. Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, M, I.
4. So far we have: A _ _ S _  (with the S not in position 4 or 5).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Possible vowels left: U (since A is already used, and E, I, O are ruled out).

Let’s look at A _ _ S _ with one U and two unused consonants in positions 2 and 3.

Candidate words that fit:
- AUGHS – uses H and G, but GH is uncommon.
- ABUZZ – ZZ is unlikely early.
- AUNTS – common letters, uses T and N.

“AUNTS” fits:
- A(✓)  
- N and T are new and common.  
- S is now in position 4 again, but since we got S(✓) in position 4 in AMISS, we know S can’t be there; therefore AUNTS will help confirm if S belongs in position 5.

Alternatively, to force S into position 5 we could test A _ _ _ S.  
A good word for that pattern is “ALBAS” (but B and L are okay) or “APERS” (but E is ruled out).  
“ALTHS” isn’t valid.  

Most straightforward is AUNTS to test N and T while leaving S in 4 (which should be marked - again if it belongs elsewhere).

However, let’s pick a word that places S in position 5 directly: “ASPEN” is invalid (E).  
“ASHES” uses E.  
“ANKUS” uses K and U and puts S last.  

“ANKUS” fits: A N K U S, all letters new except A and S, and S is now in the correct final position.

So I’ll guess ANKUS.

(If ANKUS gives S(✓) in position 5 we’ll know pattern A _ _ _ S, and we can then test remaining consonants.)

A good word for that pattern is “ALBAS” (but B and L are okay) or “APERS” (but E is ruled out).  
“ALTHS” isn’t valid.  

Most straightforward is AUNTS to test N and T while leaving S in 4 (which should be marked - again if it belongs elsewhere).

However, let’s pick a word that places S in position 5 directly: “ASPEN” is invalid (E).  
“ASHES” uses E.  
“ANKUS” uses K and U and puts S last.  

“ANKUS” fits: A N K U S, all letters new except A and S, and S is now in the correct final position.

So I’ll guess ANKUS.

(If ANKUS gives S(✓) in position 5 we’ll know pattern A _ _ _ S, and we can then test remaining consonants.)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 1, S is somewhere in the word, and R, O, E are out.

2. AMISS → A(✓) M(x) I(x) S(✓) S(-)  
   ⇒ Only one S is allowed; since the second S got “-” we now know S is NOT in position 5.

3. ANKUS → A(✓) N(x) K(x) U(x) S(-)  
   ⇒ S is NOT in position 5 (again confirmed) and N, K, U are out.

So the target pattern is:
A _ _ S _   (because S must appear once and must be in position 4).
And the letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, W, Y, etc. (excluding already ruled-out R, O, E, M, I, N, K, U).

We need two consonants at positions 2 and 3, with position 4 already S and position 5 still unknown.

Candidate words that fit A _ _ S _ :
- ABUSE – E is out.  
- ACIDS – I is out.  
- AGAST – A already used twice (invalid).  
- ALBSS – not valid.  
- APHIS – I is out.  
- ARTSY – R is out.  

A simple valid word is “ABASH” – but H at 5 and A at 2 would duplicate A.  
Next simple valid word: “ABASE” – E is out.  

Looking again, the only common English word left that fits A _ _ S _ without any disallowed letters is “ABUZZ” – but Z is rare and U is out.  

Wait, let’s list usable consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, W, Y.  
With position 4 fixed as S, we need A C _ S _ or A B _ S _ or etc.

Real possibilities:  
- “ACTSS” – invalid.  
- “ALBSS” – invalid.  
Actually the only common English word that fits A _ _ S _ with no forbidden letters is “AWASH” – but H at 5 is okay, W and A are allowed, and A is already in 1.  

Check: A W A S H – duplicate A is allowed? Yes, the duplicate A at 2 is not ruled out (only position 1 is fixed).  

So “AWASH” is a valid guess: A W A S H. It tests W, A (again), and H for the final position.

But we also have “ALPS”-like words:  
“ALP S _” needs a fifth letter – no.  

Another clean candidate: “APTLY” – but L is allowed, Y allowed, but S is missing.  

Recheck: we need A _ _ S _.  
With consonants unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, W, Y.  
Try “ABYSS” – S is duplicated and one S would be marked wrong.  

Actually, the only common word left fitting exactly A _ _ S _ without any ruled-out letters is:

A L O S S – invalid (O out).  
A B O S S – O out.  
A D U S T – U out.  

Wait, let’s simply scan:  
A B S _ _ – but S must be in 4.  

Eventually, the valid, common English word that fits is “ABASE” – but E is out.  

Next: “ABUSE” – U and E out.  

So list again: position 1: A, position 4: S.  
So pattern A _ _ S _.  
Valid English words in this pattern that use only allowed letters:  
“AWASH” (A W A S H) – letters W, A, S, H all allowed so far, and it’s a real word.  

It’s the best remaining guess.

Based on the feedback, the word must be A _ _ S _ (A in position 1, S in position 4). All previously tried consonants and vowels except A and S have been ruled out, and the only remaining common word fitting that pattern with the allowed letters is “AWASH”.
