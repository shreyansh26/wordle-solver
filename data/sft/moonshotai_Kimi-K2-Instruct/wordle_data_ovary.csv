For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. Uses distinct letters to test more positions

Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, I, O, C, D. Some popular first words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- These letters appear in many English words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, O (each only once), and two more letters that are **not** A, R, O, S, E.  
Also, none of A, R, O are in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position respectively.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Includes A, R, O in new positions.
- Introduces two new, common letters (avoiding S and E).
- Keeps consonants that pair well with the vowels we already know are present.

A good candidate is “ROACH”:
- R (known in word) moves to position 1.
- O (known in word) moves to position 2.
- A (known in word) moves to position 3.
- C and H are new letters that didn’t appear in the first guess.

Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words\n2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z to maximize information gain\n3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants\n4. Uses distinct letters to test more positions\n\nGood starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, I, O, C, D. Some popular first words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers:\n- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 very common consonants (R, S)\n- All distinct letters\n- These letters appear in many English words\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- S and E are NOT in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word contains the letters A, R, O (each only once), and two more letters that are **not** A, R, O, S, E.  \nAlso, none of A, R, O are in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position respectively.\n\nLet’s pick a word that:\n- Includes A, R, O in new positions.\n- Introduces two new, common letters (avoiding S and E).\n- Keeps consonants that pair well with the vowels we already know are present.\n\nA good candidate is “ROACH”:\n- R (known in word) moves to position 1.\n- O (known in word) moves to position 2.\n- A (known in word) moves to position 3.\n- C and H are new letters that didn’t appear in the first guess.\n\n<guess>ROACH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROACH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) A(✓) C(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Breakdown of the new feedback:\n\n1.

Let's update what we now know after the third guess ORANG:

1. O(✓) – O is in the word and is in position 1.  
   So the pattern is now: O _ A _ _

2. R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
   The only remaining positions for R are 4 or 5.

3. A(✓) – A is in position 3 (already established).

4. N(x) – N is NOT in the word.

5. G(x) – G is NOT in the word.

Letters we have eliminated so far (from all guesses): S, E, C, H, N, G.  
Letters we know are in the word: O (position 1), A (position 3), R (position 4 or 5).

We still need two unknown letters in positions 2 and 5 (if R is in 4) or 2 and 4 (if R is in 5).

Possible pattern:
- If R is in position 4: O _ A R _
- If R is in position 5: O _ A _ R

For the remaining positions we need two new common consonants (not S, E, C, H, N, G). Popular unused consonants include D, L, M, T, B, F, K, P, V, Y.

Let's try placing R in position 4 and see if we can find a valid word: O _ A R _.  
Possible vowel for position 2: I, U (since A, E, O are already used).  
O I A R _ – need a letter for position 5. Let's try D: O I A R D – “OIARD” isn’t a word.  
O U A R _ – try D: O U A R D – “OUARD” isn’t a word.  
Let’s try L: O U A R L – “OUARL” isn’t a word.  
Try T: O U A R T – “OUART” isn’t a word.  

Let’s instead place R in position 5: O _ A _ R.  
For position 2: common vowels (I, U).  
For position 4: common consonants (D, L, M, T, B, K, P, V).  

Try O I A D R – “OIADR” isn’t a word.  
O I A L R – “OIALR” isn’t a word.  
O I A M R – “OIAMR” isn’t a word.  
O I A T R – “OIATR” isn’t a word.  
O U A D R – “OUADR” isn’t a word.  
O U A L R – “OULAR” isn’t a word.  
O U A M R – “OUAMR” isn’t a word.  
O U A T R – “OUATR” isn’t a word.  

Let’s try a consonant in position 2 instead. We’ve used A, O, R.  
Common consonants left: D, L, M, T, B, K, P, V.  

Try O B A R D – “OBARD” isn’t a word.  
O B A _ R – let’s try O B A K R – “OBAKR” isn’t a word.  
O B A L R – “OBALR” isn’t a word.  

Wait – let’s try O B A R K – “OBARK” isn’t a word.  

Let’s try O M A R D – “OMARD” isn’t a word.  

Let me think differently – maybe position 2 is a vowel (I or U) and position 4 is a consonant.  

Try O I A R V – “OIARV” isn’t a word.  

Let’s try O F A R D – “OFARD” isn’t a word.  

Hmm – let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with O _ A and contain R in position 4 or 5.

Valid words:
- O B A R D – no.  
- O K A R D – no.  
- O V A R D – no.  
- O L A R D – no.  

Wait – “OVARY” is a word, but Y is the last letter and we haven’t tried Y.  
Pattern: O _ A _ Y.  
We know R must be in the word, so R must be in position 2 or 4.  

Try O R A _ Y – “ORA_Y”.  
Position 4: need a consonant. “ORACY” isn’t a word. “ORADY” isn’t.  
Try O V A R Y – “OVARY” – yes!  

Check constraints:
- O is in position 1 – ✓ from feedback.  
- A is in position 3 – ✓.  
- R must be in the word – in position 4 – ✓ (feedback said R is not in 2).  
- V and Y are new letters not yet tried.  
- Letters eliminated so far: S, E, C, H, N, G – V and Y are fine.  

“OVARY” fits all constraints.
