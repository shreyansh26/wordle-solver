For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and is likely to give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, N, S, L. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and should help me identify which of these key letters might be in the secret word.

From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:
- A, R, O are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So future guesses should:
- Use A, R, O.
- Avoid S and E.
- Reposition A, R, and O to new slots.

Possible new positions:
- A, R, and O must move to slots 3, 4, or 5 (since they were in slots 1, 2, 3 originally).
- We need two more letters (not S or E) to fill the remaining two slots.

A good starting set of candidate consonants is T, N, L, C, H, D, etc. I’ll try to place A, R, O in fresh positions while picking two new consonants.

One promising word is “RATIO”:
- Uses R, A, O (all known letters).
- Adds T and I, both still possible.
- Repositioning: A now in slot 2, R in 1, O in 5.
- T and I appear in slots 3 and 4.

However, since we know E is out and S is out, and we want to test T and I, “RATIO” is valid and keeps all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is RATIO.

2) RATIO → R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)

   – T and I are NOT in the word.  

Known facts:

- Letters we must avoid: S, E, T, I  
- Remaining common consonants still allowed: N, L, C, H, D, M, P, …  
- We have 5 slots; A, R, O must each go somewhere they haven’t been yet.

Positions each letter has already occupied:
- A was in 1, then 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- R was in 2, then 1 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- O was in 3, then 5 → must be 1, 2, or 4 now.  

We need two more distinct consonants, neither S/E/T/I, and we want to test common ones. Good candidates: N, L, C, H, D, M, P.

Let’s try to place everything in fresh spots:
- Put O in spot 1 (first fresh spot for O).  
- Need two new consonants: choose C and N (both common and still allowed).  
- Distribute A, R, C, N among spots 2-5 without repeating earlier positions.

One valid arrangement: O, C, R, A, N → “OCRAN” (but not a dictionary word).  
Better arrangement: C, O, R, A, N → “CORAN” (still invalid).  
Correct dictionary word using the same letters: “CRANO” (invalid).  
Dictionary-valid option: “CROON” (but repeats O).

Current knowledge:
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: A, R, O
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, T, I, C, L
- Each of A, R, O has now been tried in the following positions:
   – A: 1, 2, 4  ⇒ must now go to 3 or 5
   – R: 2, 1, 3  ⇒ must now go to 4 or 5
   – O: 3, 5, 2  ⇒ must now go to 1 or 4
Remaining common consonants that have never been used yet and are not ruled out: D, N, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need two more distinct consonants (cannot be S/E/T/I/C/L) and positions for A, R, O that avoid their previous spots.

Let’s test placing:
  – O in slot 1 (fresh for O)
  – A in slot 3 (fresh for A)
  – R in slot 4 (fresh for R)
That leaves slots 2 and 5 to fill with two new consonants. Good choices: N and D.

Word formed: O N A R D → ONARD (not valid), so reverse last two: O N A R D → “ONARD” (invalid).  
Try swapping: O N D A R → “ONDAR” (invalid).  
Better: pick common word “ANDRO” (invalid).  
Look for dictionary word that uses A in 3, R in 4, O in 1, and two fresh consonants.

Valid word: “DONAR” (invalid).  
Try “RADON” (invalid).  
Alternative: place O in 4 instead, A in 5, R in 1.  
Candidate: R A N D O → “RANDO” (invalid).  
Another configuration: A in 5, R in 4, O in 1: O _ _ R A.  
Fill with N and D: O N D R A → “ONDRA” (invalid).  
Check dictionary again: “HONDA” – but H already free, O in 1, N in 2, D in 3, A in 5, R nowhere.  
Need R in 4: O N R A D → “ONRAD” (invalid).  
Try “GONAD” – G and D unused so far.  
Positions: 1-G, 2-O, 3-N, 4-A, 5-D — but R is missing.  
We must include R.

Best so far: positions O(2), A(3), R(5).  
Slots 1 & 4: N and D: N O A D R → “NOADR” (invalid).  
Switch to N O A R D → “NOARD” (invalid).  
Try N in 1, O in 2, A in 3, R in 4, D in 5 → “NOARD” (invalid).  
Look for real word: “ABORN” (invalid).  
Finally, consider “ABORD” vs “ABORN” – none exist.  
We need to test a known valid word.  

Valid word that keeps A in 3, R in 4, O in 1, plus two new consonants:  
O N A R D → “ONARD” (invalid).  
Real word: “HONDA” fails R.  
Real word: “RADON” puts A in 2 (forbidden).  
Real word: “ANDRO” puts A at 1 (forbidden).

Check constraints:
- Contains N and D (new allowed consonants).  
- Contains A, R, O (required) in fresh positions:  
   – A now in 4 (never tried)  
   – R now in 3 (never tried)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ovary,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, N, S, L. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and should help me identify which of these key letters might be in the secret word.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:
- A, R, O are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So future guesses should:
- Use A, R, O.
- Avoid S and E.
- Reposition A, R, and O to new slots.

Possible new positions:
- A, R, and O must move to slots 3, 4, or 5 (since they were in slots 1, 2, 3 originally).
- We need two more letters (not S or E) to fill the remaining two slots.

A good starting set of candidate consonants is T, N, L, C, H, D, etc. I’ll try to place A, R, O in fresh positions while picking two new consonants.

One promising word is “RATIO”:
- Uses R, A, O (all known letters).
- Adds T and I, both still possible.
- Repositioning: A now in slot 2, R in 1, O in 5.
- T and I appear in slots 3 and 4.

However, since we know E is out and S is out, and we want to test T and I, “RATIO” is valid and keeps all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is RATIO.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have feedback from two guesses:

1) AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are in the word but currently in the wrong positions.  
   – S and E are not in the word.

2) RATIO → R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)  
   – Confirms A, R, O are still misplaced.  
   – T and I are NOT in the word.  

Known facts:
- Letters we must use: A, R, O  
- Letters we must avoid: S, E, T, I  
- Remaining common consonants still allowed: N, L, C, H, D, M, P, …  
- We have 5 slots; A, R, O must each go somewhere they haven’t been yet.

Positions each letter has already occupied:
- A was in 1, then 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- R was in 2, then 1 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- O was in 3, then 5 → must be 1, 2, or 4 now.  

We need two more distinct consonants, neither S/E/T/I, and we want to test common ones. Good candidates: N, L, C, H, D, M, P.

Let’s try to place everything in fresh spots:
- Put O in spot 1 (first fresh spot for O).  
- Need two new consonants: choose C and N (both common and still allowed).  
- Distribute A, R, C, N among spots 2-5 without repeating earlier positions.

One valid arrangement: O, C, R, A, N → “OCRAN” (but not a dictionary word).  
Better arrangement: C, O, R, A, N → “CORAN” (still invalid).  
Correct dictionary word using the same letters: “CRANO” (invalid).  
Dictionary-valid option: “CROON” (but repeats O).  
Another: “CORAL” – but L is fine; check positions: C(1) O(2) R(3) A(4) L(5).  
Positions used:  
- A now in 4 (new)  
- R now in 3 (new)  
- O now in 2 (new)  
- Adds C and L (both allowed).  

“CORAL” satisfies every constraint.

We now have four guesses and their feedback.

1) AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
2) RATIO → R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)
3) CORAL → C(x) O(-) R(-) A(-) L(x)
4) NORAD → N(x) O(-) R(-) A(-) D(x)

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E, T, I, C, L, N, D.

Letters we know ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, R, O.

The remaining unused common consonants are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But based on common English, likely candidates are B, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

We also need to place A, R, O in positions they haven't been yet. Let's track their positions:

- A has been in positions 1, 2, 4 (from AROSE, RATIO, CORAL, NORAD). So A must now be in 3 or 5.
- R has been in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So R must now be in 5.
- O has been in positions 2, 3, 5. So O must now be in 1 or 4.

We have two new letters to add. Let's pick two common unused consonants, say B and G.

Now let's try to arrange:
Option 1: O _ A _ R (O in 1, A in 3, R in 5). Need two new consonants in 2 and 4. Let's try B and G → O B A G R. That's a valid word (""OBAGR"" is not a word), but ""BARON"" is a valid word but has A in 2 (invalid). ""GROAN"" has A in 4 (allowed), O in 3 (invalid). ""ARGON"" has A in 1 (invalid).

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need positions:
- A must be 3 or 5.
- R must be 5 (since it can't be 1-4).
- Therefore A must be 3 (since R is 5).
- O must be 1 or 4 (since it has been 2,3,5).

So possible patterns:
1) O _ A _ R → need consonants in 2 and 4. Valid word: ""OMAHR"" invalid. ""OPAHR"" invalid.
2) _ _ A O R (O in 4, A in 3, R in 5). Need consonants 1 and 2. Valid word: ""B A A O R"" invalid. ""F A A O R"" invalid.

Wait, let's find a real word that fits A in 3, R in 5, O in 1 or 4.

Real words:
- O in 1: O _ A _ R → need consonants in 2 and 4. ""OBAHR"" invalid.
- O in 4: _ _ A O R → consonants 1 and 2. ""B A A O R"" invalid. ""F A A O R"" invalid. ""M A A O R"" invalid.

Real word: ""FORAM"" has A in 3, but M is new, but R needs to be 5. ""FORAM"" has R in 2 (invalid).

Real word: ""ROSAE"" has E,S invalid.

Real word: ""ROSAL"" has L,S invalid.

Real word: ""ROSAM"" has S invalid.

This is tricky. Let's try a word that is valid and uses fresh consonants while placing A, R, O correctly.

Looking at constraints:
- A must be in 3 or 5 (but R must be 5), so A in 3, R in 5.
- O must be in 1 or 4.

Option 1: O _ A _ R → need consonants in 2 and 4. ""OKAYR"" invalid. ""OPAHR"" invalid. ""OBAMR"" invalid.
Option 2: _ _ A O R → consonants 1 and 2. ""BHAOR"" invalid. ""GHAYR"" invalid.

Real word: ""AHORR"" invalid.

Real word: ""BHAOR"" invalid.

Real word: ""PHARO"" has P,H new. ""PHARO"" is invalid spelling (PHARAOH is 7 letters).

Real word: ""MAJOR"" has J new. Let's check:
- M, A, J, O, R.
- Positions:
  - A is 2 (invalid, was 1,2,4).
  
Real word: ""MAJOR"" invalid for A.

Real word: ""GROMA"" invalid for A.

Real word: ""YORAM"" invalid.

This is surprisingly hard. Let's list remaining possible consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two new consonants and positions:
- A must be 3
- R must be 5
- O must be 1 or 4.

Option 1: O _ A _ R → consonants 2 and 4. Need 2 new consonants.
Real words: ""OPAHR"" invalid, ""OKAYR"" invalid, ""OBADR"" invalid.

This suggests we might have to use less common consonants or re-evaluate. Let's try ""FORAY"" again but adjust.

Actually, let's systematically list possible words with A in 3, R in 5, and O in 1 or 4, and two new consonants.

Option 1: O _ A _ R
- O in 1, A in 3, R in 5
- Need consonants 2 and 4
Possible consonants left: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Valid English words: ""OBAMA"" (invalid), ""OFAYR"" invalid, ""OKAYR"" invalid, ""OMAHR"" invalid, ""OPAHR"" invalid.

Option 2: _ _ A O R
- A in 3, O in 4, R in 5
- Need consonants 1 and 2
Possible consonants: same list
Valid English words: ""BHAMO"" invalid, ""FHAMO"" invalid, ""GHAMO"" invalid, ""HHAMO"" invalid, ""JHAMO"" invalid, ""KHAMO"" invalid, ""MHAMO"" invalid, ""PHAMO"" invalid, ""QHAMO"" invalid, ""UHAMO"" invalid, ""VHAMO"" invalid, ""WHAMO"" invalid, ""XHAMO"" invalid, ""YHAMO"" invalid, ""ZHAMO"" invalid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,ovary,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and is likely to give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, N, S, L. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and should help me identify which of these key letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:
- A, R, O are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So future guesses should:
- Use A, R, O.
- Avoid S and E.
- Reposition A, R, and O to new slots.

Possible new positions:
- A, R, and O must move to slots 3, 4, or 5 (since they were in slots 1, 2, 3 originally).
- We need two more letters (not S or E) to fill the remaining two slots.

A good starting set of candidate consonants is T, N, L, C, H, D, etc. I’ll try to place A, R, O in fresh positions while picking two new consonants.

One promising word is “RATIO”:
- Uses R, A, O (all known letters).
- Adds T and I, both still possible.
- Repositioning: A now in slot 2, R in 1, O in 5.
- T and I appear in slots 3 and 4.

However, since we know E is out and S is out, and we want to test T and I, “RATIO” is valid and keeps all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is RATIO.

<guess>RATIO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have feedback from two guesses:

1) AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are in the word but currently in the wrong positions.  
   – S and E are not in the word.

2) RATIO → R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)  
   – Confirms A, R, O are still misplaced.  
   – T and I are NOT in the word.  

Known facts:
- Letters we must use: A, R, O  
- Letters we must avoid: S, E, T, I  
- Remaining common consonants still allowed: N, L, C, H, D, M, P, …  
- We have 5 slots; A, R, O must each go somewhere they haven’t been yet.

Positions each letter has already occupied:
- A was in 1, then 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- R was in 2, then 1 → must be 3, 4, or 5 now.  
- O was in 3, then 5 → must be 1, 2, or 4 now.  

We need two more distinct consonants, neither S/E/T/I, and we want to test common ones. Good candidates: N, L, C, H, D, M, P.

Let’s try to place everything in fresh spots:
- Put O in spot 1 (first fresh spot for O).  
- Need two new consonants: choose C and N (both common and still allowed).  
- Distribute A, R, C, N among spots 2-5 without repeating earlier positions.

One valid arrangement: O, C, R, A, N → “OCRAN” (but not a dictionary word).  
Better arrangement: C, O, R, A, N → “CORAN” (still invalid).  
Correct dictionary word using the same letters: “CRANO” (invalid).  
Dictionary-valid option: “CROON” (but repeats O).  
Another: “CORAL” – but L is fine; check positions: C(1) O(2) R(3) A(4) L(5).  
Positions used:  
- A now in 4 (new)  
- R now in 3 (new)  
- O now in 2 (new)  
- Adds C and L (both allowed).  

“CORAL” satisfies every constraint.

<guess>CORAL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: CORAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) R(-) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: A, R, O
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, T, I, C, L
- Each of A, R, O has now been tried in the following positions:
   – A: 1, 2, 4  ⇒ must now go to 3 or 5
   – R: 2, 1, 3  ⇒ must now go to 4 or 5
   – O: 3, 5, 2  ⇒ must now go to 1 or 4
Remaining common consonants that have never been used yet and are not ruled out: D, N, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need two more distinct consonants (cannot be S/E/T/I/C/L) and positions for A, R, O that avoid their previous spots.

Let’s test placing:
  – O in slot 1 (fresh for O)
  – A in slot 3 (fresh for A)
  – R in slot 4 (fresh for R)
That leaves slots 2 and 5 to fill with two new consonants. Good choices: N and D.

Word formed: O N A R D → ONARD (not valid), so reverse last two: O N A R D → “ONARD” (invalid).  
Try swapping: O N D A R → “ONDAR” (invalid).  
Better: pick common word “ANDRO” (invalid).  
Look for dictionary word that uses A in 3, R in 4, O in 1, and two fresh consonants.

Valid word: “DONAR” (invalid).  
Try “RADON” (invalid).  
Alternative: place O in 4 instead, A in 5, R in 1.  
Candidate: R A N D O → “RANDO” (invalid).  
Another configuration: A in 5, R in 4, O in 1: O _ _ R A.  
Fill with N and D: O N D R A → “ONDRA” (invalid).  
Check dictionary again: “HONDA” – but H already free, O in 1, N in 2, D in 3, A in 5, R nowhere.  
Need R in 4: O N R A D → “ONRAD” (invalid).  
Try “GONAD” – G and D unused so far.  
Positions: 1-G, 2-O, 3-N, 4-A, 5-D — but R is missing.  
We must include R.

Best so far: positions O(2), A(3), R(5).  
Slots 1 & 4: N and D: N O A D R → “NOADR” (invalid).  
Switch to N O A R D → “NOARD” (invalid).  
Try N in 1, O in 2, A in 3, R in 4, D in 5 → “NOARD” (invalid).  
Look for real word: “ABORN” (invalid).  
Finally, consider “ABORD” vs “ABORN” – none exist.  
We need to test a known valid word.  

Valid word that keeps A in 3, R in 4, O in 1, plus two new consonants:  
O N A R D → “ONARD” (invalid).  
Real word: “HONDA” fails R.  
Real word: “RADON” puts A in 2 (forbidden).  
Real word: “ANDRO” puts A at 1 (forbidden).  
Real word: “DRANO” – D and N new, A in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (forbidden).  
Real word: “ADORN” – A at 1 (forbidden).  
Real word: “DOORN” – O twice.  
Real word: “ROUND” – O at 3 (forbidden).  
Real word: “FROND” – F new, R at 2 (forbidden).  
Real word: “NORAD” – N, D new; positions:
   1-N, 2-O (fresh), 3-R (fresh), 4-A (fresh), 5-D — word “NORAD” is valid!

Check constraints:
- Contains N and D (new allowed consonants).  
- Contains A, R, O (required) in fresh positions:  
   – A now in 4 (never tried)  
   – R now in 3 (never tried)  
   – O now in 2 (never tried)
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

Therefore “NORAD” is the next valid guess.

- We know the word must contain A, R, O (each has appeared with the “-” sign every time).
- We have eliminated: S, E, T, I, C, L, N, D.
- We have tried the following positions for the three required letters:
   A: 1, 2, 4, 3  
   R: 2, 1, 3, 4  
   O: 3, 5, 2, 2
- The only positions we have NOT yet tried for the three letters are:
   A: 5  
   R: 5  (but can’t also be 5)  
   O: 1, 4
- Therefore the only unused position for A is slot 5.
- For O, the fresh positions are 1 and 4.
- For R, the only fresh position left is 5, but that would clash with A. Hence R must actually be in slot 5 and A in slot 5 is impossible. This tells us our prior bookkeeping must be rechecked.

Re-summarize all tried positions for each of A, R, O:

A: 1 (AROSE), 2 (RATIO), 4 (CORAL), 3 (NORAD)  → only slot 5 is fresh  
R: 2 (AROSE), 1 (RATIO), 3 (CORAL), 4 (NORAD)  → only slot 5 is fresh  
O: 3 (AROSE), 5 (RATIO), 2 (CORAL, NORAD)      → slots 1 and 4 are fresh  

So we must fit A, R, O into:
   A → 5
   R → 5  (same slot impossible) — contradiction.

Realization: the only way both A and R can occupy 5 is impossible, so one of them must have been miscounted. Recount for R:
- AROSE: R was 2
- RATIO: R was 1
- CORAL: R was 3
- NORAD: R was 4
Fresh for R: slot 5

Fresh for A: slot 5  
Fresh for O: slots 1 and 4

Hence we must place A and R both in slot 5 — impossible. Therefore the correct interpretation is that we must place:
- A in 5
- R in 5  → impossible, so our bookkeeping is correct and we must use the word that puts A and R in the only remaining positions they can occupy without overlap, meaning we must have made an error in prior steps.

Actually, the only remaining fresh positions are:
- A: 5
- R: (already tried 2,1,3,4) → 5 is only fresh but occupied by A.  
- O: 1 and 4

This implies the word must be **A _ _ _ R** with O somewhere in 2 or 3 or 4. But we have not yet tried O in slot 1 or 4 with A in 5 and R in 5 impossible. Therefore we recheck the fresh positions:

Correct fresh positions:
- A: 5 (only remaining)
- R: 5 (only remaining) — impossible together.

Therefore one of A, R, O must have been miscounted. Checking again:

A: 1,2,4,3 → only 5 fresh  
R: 2,1,3,4 → only 5 fresh  
O: 3,5,2,2 → 1 and 4 fresh  

Thus we need to place O in 1 or 4, A in 5, R in 5 — impossible. This contradiction indicates the word must have A in 5, R in 5, O in 1 or 4. Clearly impossible, so we must have missed a valid placement.

Correct approach: list the only remaining possible permutations of A, R, O in the unused slots (1,4,5) with the unused positions:

Available slots: 1, 4, 5  
Fresh for A: 5  
Fresh for R: 5  
Fresh for O: 1, 4  

Hence the word must be:
O in 1, then A and R must be in 4 and 5 but A must be 5 and R must be 5 — impossible.  
O in 4, then A and R must be in 1 and 5 but A must be 5, R must be 5 — impossible.

The only resolution is that the correct word must be **ARBOR** — but B not tested. We must test B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Given the constraints and needing two more letters not yet used, the simplest valid word that uses fresh positions is **ABHOR**:

Positions:
1: A (fresh)  
2: B (new, allowed)  
3: H (new, allowed)  
4: O (fresh)  
5: R (fresh)  

Check:
- Contains A, R, O in new positions.
- Uses new letters B, H.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Hence next guess is ABHOR.
