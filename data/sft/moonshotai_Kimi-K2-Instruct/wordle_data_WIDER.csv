For the first guess in Wordle, the goal is to maximize information gain by testing common letters and positions. A good starting word should include:
- Frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Common vowels (like E, A, I, O, U)
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It tests common positions for these letters

This gives us maximum coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Let's break down the cumulative feedback so far:

1. Letters we know are **not** in the word:  
   A, O, S, T (from both guesses)

2. Letters we know **are** in the word and their positions:  
   - I is in position 3 (✓)  
   - E is in the word but **not** in position 4 (E(-) in both guesses, so E ≠ 4, ≠ 5)

3. Letters we know are in the word but not yet placed:  
   - R (present, but not in position 2 and not in position 3)  
   - D (present, but not in position 5)

So the current partial word looks like:  
_ _ I _ _  
with R and D still to place, and E somewhere else (positions 1 or 2).

Possible remaining vowels: none left (A, O, I, E already considered).  
Consonants still available: common ones like N, L, C, etc.

Let’s find a word that:
- Has I in position 3.  
- Has E in position 1 or 2.  
- Has R and D in the remaining two positions (but not in their previous wrong spots).  
- Uses new consonants to test.

A good candidate is ""RIDGE"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R)  
- I in position 3 (known correct)  
- D in position 4 (new position for D)  
- G and E in new positions (E must be in 2 or 5; 5 is allowed since E was only excluded from 4 and 5 in previous feedback).

But wait: E was excluded from position 5 in AROSE (E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 2 in this case.  
Thus, the word must have E in position 2, I in position 3, and R and D in 1,4, or 5.

""R"" can't be in position 2 (already known) or 3 (occupied by I), so it can be in 1,4, or 5.  
""D"" can't be in position 5 (from TIRED), so it can be in 1,2, or 4. But 2 is E, 3 is I, so D must be in 1 or 4.

Let's try ""R"" in position 1 and ""D"" in position 4:  
R _ I D _  
But position 2 must be E (since E must be in 1 or 2, and 1 is R). So:  
R E I D _  

Now we need a consonant for position 5. From letters not used: N, L, C, etc. ""N"" is very common.  
Thus, ""REIDN"" is invalid (not a word), but ""RIDEN"" is also invalid.  
Wait, ""R"" must be in position 1, ""E"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, so the word would be R E I D ?.  
But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only valid word here is ""R E I D N"" – but ""REIDN"" isn't a word.  

Alternative: ""D"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4:  
D _ I R _  
E must be in position 2 or 5. 5 was excluded for E in AROSE, so E must be in position 2:  
D E I R _  
Now position 5: unused consonants could be N, L, etc. ""DEIRN"" isn't a word, but ""DEIRD"" is invalid.  

Another approach: ""E"" in position 1, ""I"" in 3, and place R and D elsewhere.  
E _ I _ _  
R can't be in 2 or 3, so 4 or 5.  
D can't be in 5, so 2 or 4.  

Option 1: E _ I R D – ""EIRDR"" invalid.  
Option 2: E D I R _ – ""EDIR_"" – needs a consonant in 5. ""EDIRN"" isn't a word.  

Let me think differently: possible words with I in 3 and E somewhere else (1 or 2), R and D placed correctly.  

Consider ""DRIVE"":
- D in 1 (new position for D)  
- R in 2 (but R was excluded from position 2 in AROSE!) – invalid.  

""DIRGE"":
- D in 1  
- I in 3  
- R in 4 (new position for R)  
- G in 5  
- E must be in 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5) – but then the word is D E I R G, which is ""DEIRG"" – invalid.  

""CRIME"":
- C (new)  
- R (position 2 – invalid, excluded)  

""PRIDE"":
- P (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""BRIDE"":
- B (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""GRIDE"":
- G (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""URINE"":
- U (new vowel, but all vowels except I and E are excluded)  
- R in 3 – invalid (I is in 3)  

""TRIED"": already used T (excluded).  

""FRIED"": F (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""PRIED"": P (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""WRIED"": W (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""DRIFT"": F (new), T (excluded)  

""DRINK"": N (new), K (new) – but I is in 3: D R I N K – feedback would have R in 2 (invalid).  

Wait, let me re-examine positions:  
Current known:  
- I in 3  
- E must be in 1 or 2  
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2 or 3)  
- D must be in 1,2, or 4 (not 3 or 5)  

Possible combinations:  
1. E in 1:  
   E _ I _ _  
   R can be 4 or 5  
   D can be 2 or 4  
   - If R in 4 and D in 2: E D I R _ – need 5th letter. ""EDIRX"" – no.  
   - If R in 5 and D in 2: E D I _ R – ""EDIR_ R"" – no valid word.  
   - If R in 4 and D in 4 – impossible.  

2. E in 2:  
   _ E I _ _  
   R can be 1,4, or 5  
   D can be 1 or 4  
   - R in 1, D in 4: R E I D _ – need 5th letter. ""REIDN"" invalid.  
   - R in 4, D in 1: D E I R _ – need 5th letter. ""DEIRN"" invalid.  
   - R in 5, D in 1: D E I _ R – ""DEIR_ R"" – no.  

Hmm, seems like no valid words fit. Let me re-check constraints:  
Actually, in Guess 1 (AROSE), E was position 5 with (-), meaning E is not in position 5. In Guess 2 (TIRED), E was position 4 with (✓) – this implies E is in position 4, contradicting earlier interpretation.

Wait, the feedback for TIRED was:  
T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)  
This means:  
- I is correctly in position 3 (✓)  
- E is correctly in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (from R(-))  
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (from D(-))  

Thus, the word has:  
- I in 3  
- E in 4  
- R and D are elsewhere (positions 1,2,5)  

Now possible word structure:  
_ _ I E _  
with R and D in 1,2, or 5, and letters not used: common consonants like N, L, etc.  

Possible valid words:  
""DIRGE"": D in 1, I in 3, E in 4, R in 5 (but R(-) in TIRED means R is not in 5) – invalid.  

""PRIDE"": P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – but D can't be in 5 (from TIRED).  

""BRIDE"": same issue with D in 5.  

""GRIDE"": G in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – same issue.  

""RIDGE"": R in 1, I in 3, D in 4, G in 5 – but E must be in 4 (from TIRED), so D can't be in 4.  

""RIVEN"":
- R in 1  
- I in 3  
- E in 4  
- V in 2  
- N in 5  
This fits: R is in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (✓), E in 4 (✓), V and N are new.  

""RIVEN"" is a valid word.

Another check: does R have any restriction? In TIRED, R was in position 3 with (-), so R is not in 3 (but it's in 1 here – fine). No other restrictions on R.

Thus, ""RIVEN"" is a valid next guess.
</think>

Based on the cumulative feedback, the word must have:
- I in position 3 (✓ from TIRED)  
- E in position 4 (✓ from TIRED)  
- R somewhere (not position 3, so 1, 2, or 5)  
- D somewhere (not position 5, so 1, 2, or 4)  
- All other letters must be new and valid.

The word ""RIVEN"" fits these constraints:
- R in position 1 (new position)  
- I in position 3 (correct)  
- V and N are new consonants  
- E in position 4 (correct)

But wait: E was excluded from position 5 in AROSE (E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 2 in this case.  
Thus, the word must have E in position 2, I in position 3, and R and D in 1,4, or 5.

""R"" can't be in position 2 (already known) or 3 (occupied by I), so it can be in 1,4, or 5.  
""D"" can't be in position 5 (from TIRED), so it can be in 1,2, or 4. But 2 is E, 3 is I, so D must be in 1 or 4.

Let's try ""R"" in position 1 and ""D"" in position 4:  
R _ I D _  
But position 2 must be E (since E must be in 1 or 2, and 1 is R). So:  
R E I D _  

Now we need a consonant for position 5. From letters not used: N, L, C, etc. ""N"" is very common.  
Thus, ""REIDN"" is invalid (not a word), but ""RIDEN"" is also invalid.  
Wait, ""R"" must be in position 1, ""E"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, so the word would be R E I D ?.  
But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only valid word here is ""R E I D N"" – but ""REIDN"" isn't a word.  

Alternative: ""D"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4:  
D _ I R _  
E must be in position 2 or 5. 5 was excluded for E in AROSE, so E must be in position 2:  
D E I R _  
Now position 5: unused consonants could be N, L, etc. ""DEIRN"" isn't a word, but ""DEIRD"" is invalid.  

Another approach: ""E"" in position 1, ""I"" in 3, and place R and D elsewhere.  
E _ I _ _  
R can't be in 2 or 3, so 4 or 5.  
D can't be in 5, so 2 or 4.  

Option 1: E _ I R D – ""EIRDR"" invalid.  
Option 2: E D I R _ – ""EDIR_"" – needs a consonant in 5. ""EDIRN"" isn't a word.  

Let me think differently: possible words with I in 3 and E somewhere else (1 or 2), R and D placed correctly.  

Consider ""DRIVE"":
- D in 1 (new position for D)  
- R in 2 (but R was excluded from position 2 in AROSE!) – invalid.  

""DIRGE"":
- D in 1  
- I in 3  
- R in 4 (new position for R)  
- G in 5  
- E must be in 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5) – but then the word is D E I R G, which is ""DEIRG"" – invalid.  

""CRIME"":
- C (new)  
- R (position 2 – invalid, excluded)  

""PRIDE"":
- P (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""BRIDE"":
- B (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""GRIDE"":
- G (new)  
- R in 2 – invalid  

""URINE"":
- U (new vowel, but all vowels except I and E are excluded)  
- R in 3 – invalid (I is in 3)  

""TRIED"": already used T (excluded).  

""FRIED"": F (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""PRIED"": P (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""WRIED"": W (new), R in 2 – invalid  

""DRIFT"": F (new), T (excluded)  

""DRINK"": N (new), K (new) – but I is in 3: D R I N K – feedback would have R in 2 (invalid).  

Wait, let me re-examine positions:  
Current known:  
- I in 3  
- E must be in 1 or 2  
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2 or 3)  
- D must be in 1,2, or 4 (not 3 or 5)  

Possible combinations:  
1. E in 1:  
   E _ I _ _  
   R can be 4 or 5  
   D can be 2 or 4  
   - If R in 4 and D in 2: E D I R _ – need 5th letter. ""EDIRX"" – no.  
   - If R in 5 and D in 2: E D I _ R – ""EDIR_ R"" – no valid word.  
   - If R in 4 and D in 4 – impossible.  

2. E in 2:  
   _ E I _ _  
   R can be 1,4, or 5  
   D can be 1 or 4  
   - R in 1, D in 4: R E I D _ – need 5th letter. ""REIDN"" invalid.  
   - R in 4, D in 1: D E I R _ – need 5th letter. ""DEIRN"" invalid.  
   - R in 5, D in 1: D E I _ R – ""DEIR_ R"" – no.  

Hmm, seems like no valid words fit. Let me re-check constraints:  
Actually, in Guess 1 (AROSE), E was position 5 with (-), meaning E is not in position 5. In Guess 2 (TIRED), E was position 4 with (✓) – this implies E is in position 4, contradicting earlier interpretation.

Wait, the feedback for TIRED was:  
T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)  
This means:  
- I is correctly in position 3 (✓)  
- E is correctly in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (from R(-))  
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (from D(-))  

Thus, the word has:  
- I in 3  
- E in 4  
- R and D are elsewhere (positions 1,2,5)  

Now possible word structure:  
_ _ I E _  
with R and D in 1,2, or 5, and letters not used: common consonants like N, L, etc.  

Possible valid words:  
""DIRGE"": D in 1, I in 3, E in 4, R in 5 (but R(-) in TIRED means R is not in 5) – invalid.  

""PRIDE"": P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – but D can't be in 5 (from TIRED).  

""BRIDE"": same issue with D in 5.  

""GRIDE"": G in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – same issue.  

""RIDGE"": R in 1, I in 3, D in 4, G in 5 – but E must be in 4 (from TIRED), so D can't be in 4.  

""RIVEN"":
- R in 1  
- I in 3  
- E in 4  
- V in 2  
- N in 5  
This fits: R is in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (✓), E in 4 (✓), V and N are new.  

""RIVEN"" is a valid word.

Another check: does R have any restriction? In TIRED, R was in position 3 with (-), so R is not in 3 (but it's in 1 here – fine). No other restrictions on R.

Thus, ""RIVEN"" is a valid next guess.Based on the cumulative feedback, the word must have:
- I in position 3 (✓ from TIRED)  
- E in position 4 (✓ from TIRED)  
- R somewhere (not position 3, so 1, 2, or 5)  
- D somewhere (not position 5, so 1, 2, or 4)  
- All other letters must be new and valid.

The word ""RIVEN"" fits these constraints:
- R in position 1 (new position)  
- I in position 3 (correct)  
- V and N are new consonants  
- E in position 4 (correct)",Guess 3: RIVEN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, the goal is to maximize information gain by testing common letters and positions. A good starting word should include:
- Frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Common vowels (like E, A, I, O, U)
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It tests common positions for these letters

This gives us maximum coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x): A is **not** in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- O(x): O is **not** in the word.
- S(x): S is **not** in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R and E, but they must be in different positions.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S.

We also know positions 2 and 5 are incorrect for R and E respectively.

Let’s find a new word that:
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5.
- Avoids A, O, S.
- Uses new letters to test more possibilities.

Candidate letters to include: common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, etc., and other vowels like I, U.

A possible word is ""TIRED"":
- T (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- R (in position 3, not 2)
- E (in position 4, not 5)
- D (new letter)

This uses R and E in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's break down the cumulative feedback so far:

1. Letters we know are **not** in the word:  
   A, O, S, T (from both guesses)

2. Letters we know **are** in the word and their positions:  
   - I is in position 3 (✓)  
   - E is in the word but **not** in position 4 (E(-) in both guesses, so E ≠ 4, ≠ 5)

3. Letters we know are in the word but not yet placed:  
   - R (present, but not in position 2 and not in position 3)  
   - D (present, but not in position 5)

So the current partial word looks like:  
_ _ I _ _  
with R and D still to place, and E somewhere else (positions 1 or 2).

Possible remaining vowels: none left (A, O, I, E already considered).  
Consonants still available: common ones like N, L, C, etc.

Let’s find a word that:
- Has I in position 3.  
- Has E in position 1 or 2.  
- Has R and D in the remaining two positions (but not in their previous wrong spots).  
- Uses new consonants to test.

A good candidate is ""RIDGE"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R)  
- I in position 3 (known correct)  
- D in position 4 (new position for D)  
- G and E in new positions (E must be in 2 or 5; 5 is allowed since E was only excluded from 4 and 5 in previous feedback).

But wait: E was excluded from position 5 in AROSE (E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 2 in this case.  
Thus, the word must have E in position 2, I in position 3, and R and D in 1,4, or 5.

""R"" can't be in position 2 (already known) or 3 (occupied by I), so it can be in 1,4, or 5.  
""D"" can't be in position 5 (from TIRED), so it can be in 1,2, or 4. But 2 is E, 3 is I, so D must be in 1 or 4.

Let's try ""R"" in position 1 and ""D"" in position 4:  
R _ I D _  
But position 2 must be E (since E must be in 1 or 2, and 1 is R). So:  
R E I D _  

Now we need a consonant for position 5. From letters not used: N, L, C, etc. ""N"" is very common.  
Thus, ""REIDN"" is invalid (not a word), but ""RIDEN"" is also invalid.  
Wait, ""R"" must be in position 1, ""E"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, so the word would be R E I D ?.  
But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only valid word here is ""R E I D N"" – but ""REIDN"" isn't a word.  

Alternative: ""D"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4:  
D _ I R _  
E must be in position 2 or 5. 5 was excluded for E in AROSE, so E must be in position 2:  
D E I R _  
Now position 5: unused consonants could be N, L, etc. ""DEIRN"" isn't a word, but ""DEIRD"" is invalid.  

Another approach: ""E"" in position 1, ""I"" in 3, and place R and D elsewhere.  
E _ I _ _  
R can't be in 2 or 3, so 4 or 5.  
D can't be in 5, so 2 or 4.  

Option 1: E _ I R D – ""EIRDR"" invalid.  
Option 2: E D I R _ – ""EDIR_"" – needs a consonant in 5. ""EDIRN"" isn't a word.  

Let me think differently: possible words with I in 3 and E somewhere else (1 or 2), R and D placed correctly.

The only valid word here is ""R E I D N"" – but ""REIDN"" isn\'t a word.  \n\nAlternative: ""D"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4:  \nD _ I R _  \nE must be in position 2 or 5. 5 was excluded for E in AROSE, so E must be in position 2:  \nD E I R _  \nNow position 5: unused consonants could be N, L, etc. ""DEIRN"" isn\'t a word, but ""DEIRD"" is invalid.  \n\nAnother approach: ""E"" in position 1, ""I"" in 3, and place R and D elsewhere.  \nE _ I _ _  \nR can\'t be in 2 or 3, so 4 or 5.  \nD can\'t be in 5, so 2 or 4.  \n\nOption 1: E _ I R D – ""EIRDR"" invalid.  \nOption 2: E D I R _ – ""EDIR_"" – needs a consonant in 5. ""EDIRN"" isn\'t a word.  \n\nLet me think differently: possible words with I in 3 and E somewhere else (1 or 2), R and D placed correctly.  \n\nConsider ""DRIVE"":\n- D in 1 (new position for D)  \n- R in 2 (but R was excluded from position 2 in AROSE!) – invalid.  \n\n""DIRGE"":\n- D in 1  \n- I in 3  \n- R in 4 (new position for R)  \n- G in 5  \n- E must be in 2 (since it can\'t be in 4 or 5) – but then the word is D E I R G, which is ""DEIRG"" – invalid.  \n\n""CRIME"":\n- C (new)  \n- R (position 2 – invalid, excluded)  \n\n""PRIDE"":\n- P (new)  \n- R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""BRIDE"":\n- B (new)  \n- R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""GRIDE"":\n- G (new)  \n- R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""URINE"":\n- U (new vowel, but all vowels except I and E are excluded)  \n- R in 3 – invalid (I is in 3)  \n\n""TRIED"": already used T (excluded).  \n\n""FRIED"": F (new), R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""PRIED"": P (new), R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""WRIED"": W (new), R in 2 – invalid  \n\n""DRIFT"": F (new), T (excluded)  \n\n""DRINK"": N (new), K (new) – but I is in 3: D R I N K – feedback would have R in 2 (invalid).  \n\nWait, let me re-examine positions:  \nCurrent known:  \n- I in 3  \n- E must be in 1 or 2  \n- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2 or 3)  \n- D must be in 1,2, or 4 (not 3 or 5)  \n\nPossible combinations:  \n1. E in 1:  \n   E _ I _ _  \n   R can be 4 or 5  \n   D can be 2 or 4  \n   - If R in 4 and D in 2: E D I R _ – need 5th letter. ""EDIRX"" – no.  \n   - If R in 5 and D in 2: E D I _ R – ""EDIR_ R"" – no valid word.  \n   - If R in 4 and D in 4 – impossible.  \n\n2. E in 2:  \n   _ E I _ _  \n   R can be 1,4, or 5  \n   D can be 1 or 4  \n   - R in 1, D in 4: R E I D _ – need 5th letter. ""REIDN"" invalid.  \n   - R in 4, D in 1: D E I R _ – need 5th letter. ""DEIRN"" invalid.  \n   - R in 5, D in 1: D E I _ R – ""DEIR_ R"" – no.  \n\nHmm, seems like no valid words fit. Let me re-check constraints:  \nActually, in Guess 1 (AROSE), E was position 5 with (-), meaning E is not in position 5. In Guess 2 (TIRED), E was position 4 with (✓) – this implies E is in position 4, contradicting earlier interpretation.\n\nWait, the feedback for TIRED was:  \nT(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)  \nThis means:  \n- I is correctly in position 3 (✓)  \n- E is correctly in position 4 (✓)  \n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (from R(-))  \n- D is in the word but not in position 5 (from D(-))  \n\nThus, the word has:  \n- I in 3  \n- E in 4  \n- R and D are elsewhere (positions 1,2,5)  \n\nNow possible word structure:  \n_ _ I E _  \nwith R and D in 1,2, or 5, and letters not used: common consonants like N, L, etc.  \n\nPossible valid words:  \n""DIRGE"": D in 1, I in 3, E in 4, R in 5 (but R(-) in TIRED means R is not in 5) – invalid.  \n\n""PRIDE"": P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – but D can\'t be in 5 (from TIRED).  \n\n""BRIDE"": same issue with D in 5.  \n\n""GRIDE"": G in 1, R in 2, I in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – same issue.  \n\n""RIDGE"": R in 1, I in 3, D in 4, G in 5 – but E must be in 4 (from TIRED), so D can\'t be in 4.  \n\n""RIVEN"":\n- R in 1  \n- I in 3  \n- E in 4  \n- V in 2  \n- N in 5  \nThis fits: R is in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (✓), E in 4 (✓), V and N are new.  \n\n""RIVEN"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother check: does R have any restriction? In TIRED, R was in position 3 with (-), so R is not in 3 (but it\'s in 1 here – fine). No other restrictions on R.\n\nThus, ""RIVEN"" is a valid next guess.Based on the cumulative feedback, the word must have:\n- I in position 3 (✓ from TIRED)  \n- E in position 4 (✓ from TIRED)  \n- R somewhere (not position 3, so 1, 2, or 5)  \n- D somewhere (not position 5, so 1, 2, or 4)  \n- All other letters must be new and valid.\n\nThe word ""RIVEN"" fits these constraints:\n- R in position 1 (new position)  \n- I in position 3 (correct)  \n- V and N are new consonants  \n- E in position 4 (correct)\n\n<guess>RIVEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: RIVEN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s tabulate everything we know so far.

Known letters and positions  
- I is in position 3 (✓ from both TIRED and RIVEN)  
- E is in position 4 (✓ from both TIRED and RIVEN)

Letters still in the word but not yet fixed  
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in position 1, 2, or 3) – so R must be in position 5  
- D (must appear somewhere, but not in position 5) – so D must be in position 1 or 2

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word  
A, O, S, T, V, N (all showed x-feedback)

So the skeleton looks like:
[1 or 2] [1 or 2] I E [R must be here]

The two remaining positions (1 and 2) must be filled with D and one unused consonant that is common and still allowed.  
Available consonants not yet tried: L, C, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

The only valid 5-letter English word that satisfies:
- D in 1 or 2  
- R in 5  
- I in 3, E in 4  
- No forbidden letters

is “DRIER” (but R already appears twice) – invalid.  
Next: “CRIER” – R already twice.  
Next: “DRIER” again invalid.

Wait: we only need one R, and the word must contain D once.  
After pruning, the correct pattern is:
D _ I E R  or  _ D I E R  

Valid English word:  
- D I E R _ – impossible, needs 5 letters.  
- _ D I E R – only one valid word: “C D I E R” is not valid.  
Actually, the correct word is “D I V E R” but V is excluded.  

Realizing we need a consonant for position 1 or 2 that hasn’t been used:  
Pattern: _ _ I E R  
With D somewhere in 1 or 2 and no forbidden letters.

The only valid word fitting is “D I E R” plus a consonant.  
Recheck: the word “DRIER” is invalid because R is duplicated and we only know one R is required.

Another candidate: “FRIER” – F is new, but R would appear twice.  

Realizing the only unambiguous fit is “CIDER”:
C I D E R – but I is fixed in 3, so invalid.

Correct pattern:  
D in 1, I in 3, E in 4, R in 5, and a consonant in 2 that hasn’t been used.  
The only valid word is “D W I E R”? No.  
“D L I E R”? No.  

Realizing the correct word is “CRIER” but R would appear twice.  

Rechecking: the word must have  
D in 1 or 2, R in 5, I in 3, E in 4, and one more consonant in the remaining slot.  
The valid word is “DRIER” again duplicates R, which is not allowed.

Realizing we need a different consonant: “WIDER” – W is new, D in 2, I in 3, E in 4, R in 5.  
“WIDER” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints:
- W, D, R are new positions  
- D is in 2 (allowed)  
- R is in 5 (allowed)  
- I in 3, E in 4 (required)  
- No forbidden letters (W, D, R are all allowed)

Hence, the next guess is WIDER.
