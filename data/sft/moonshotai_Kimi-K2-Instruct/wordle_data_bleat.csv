Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I'll choose a common 5-letter word that includes frequently used letters to maximize the chance of getting useful information. Good starting words often contain common vowels like A or E and common consonants like R, T, N, S, or L. 

I’ll pick ""AROSE"" because:
- It has three common vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions early.
- It includes two common consonants (R, S) which are often in 5-letter words.
- It’s a valid English word and a balanced starting guess for gathering information.

- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not the fifth letter).

Let’s collect all the facts we now have.

Letters in the word and their positional constraints  
- A: in the word, but not positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and LEANT feedback).  
- E: in the word, but not positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and LATED feedback) and not position 2 (from LEANT).  
- L: in the word, but not position 1 (from LATED) and not position 1 again (from LEANT).  
- T: in the word and is in position 5 (✓ from LEANT).  

Letters excluded so far  
R, O, S, D, N are all out.

So we need a 5-letter word that contains A, E, L, T (with T fixed at 5), and one additional letter that isn’t R, O, S, D, N. The remaining common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, etc.

Positions left to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, with T locked in 5.

Key constraints again  
- A can only be in 4 (not 1, 2, 3).  
- E can only be in 1 or 3 (not 2, 4, 5).  
- L can be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 will be A), so 2 or 3.  
- One more unused consonant needed.

A quick valid arrangement:  
E _ L A T → ELIAT? No, that’s not a word.  
E L _ A T → E L ? A T → need a consonant. The only remaining 3rd-letter consonant that makes a real word is M: E L M A T – but ELMAT is not a standard word.  
Let’s flip: _ E L A T – the blank must be a consonant that isn’t excluded. C works: C E L A T → invalid.  
Try L in 2 and E in 3: _ L E A T → the blank must be a consonant. C works: C L E A T → “CLEAT” is a valid English word. Check constraints:  
- C isn’t excluded.  
- A in 4 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), L in 2 (allowed), T in 5 (fixed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I’ll pick ""AROSE"" because:
- It has three common vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions early.
- It includes two common consonants (R, S) which are often in 5-letter words.
- It’s a valid English word and a balanced starting guess for gathering information.

- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not the fifth letter).

Letters to build around: A and E (must appear somewhere), plus any others that haven’t been ruled out.
Letters to avoid: R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that contains A and E (in different positions than 1 and 5), and does not contain R, O, or S. There are many possibilities; to narrow them down I’ll pick a word that also uses some other common consonants that haven’t been eliminated, like T, N, L, D, etc.

A good candidate is “LATED”:
- Contains A (now in position 2) and E (now in position 4), both different from their original positions.
- Does not contain R, O, or S.
- Uses common consonants L, T, D which could help reveal additional letters or positions.

- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- T is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So far we know the word contains A, E, L, T and excludes R, O, S, D.
Known letters: A, E, L, T (four of the five) → we still need one more letter.

Positions ruled out:
- A ≠ 1, 2
- E ≠ 4, 5
- L ≠ 1
- T ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word using A, E, L, T plus one more unused consonant (avoiding R, O, S, D). Good remaining consonants: N, G, C, B, M, F, H, etc.

Let’s try “LATEN”:
- Contains A, E, L, T and adds N.
- Check positions:
  – A in position 2: allowed (only ruled out 1 & 2, but 2 is ruled out from LATED feedback, so A cannot be in 2 either). Oops, invalid.

- A in 3, E in 1, L in 2, T in 5, N in 4.
- Check constraints:
  – A not 1 or 2: 3 is OK.
  – E not 4 or 5: 1 is OK.
