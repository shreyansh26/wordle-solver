For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to include as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicate letters. The classic starting word ""AROSE"" uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), which should give me good coverage to eliminate many possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A appears somewhere in the word (but not first position)
- E appears somewhere in the word (but not last position)
- R, O, S are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word’s letters are drawn from:
  - positions 2-5 for A
  - positions 1-4 for E
  - no R, no O, no S

I want a new guess that:
 1. keeps A and E inside their allowed positions,
 2. avoids the ruled-out letters R, O, S,
 3. introduces new common consonants.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Let me try a word like “TALEN” (T, A, L, E, N).  
Checks:
- contains A and E in new positions (A in 2, E in 4).
- introduces T, L, N—none of which have been ruled out.
- no R, O, S.

Hence I’ll guess TALEN.

E: not 5th (from AROSE), not 4th (from TALEN) ⇒ possible positions 1,2,3

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been used: D, C, P, M, G, B, I, U, Y (but Y is less common).  A good next word should place A, E, L in still-allowed positions and introduce two of these untested letters.

A simple pattern that satisfies:

LEAKY – Y ok, K not yet used.

So LEAKY:
- L 1st (allowed)
- E 2nd (allowed)
- A 3rd (allowed)
- K and Y new
- no forbidden letters (R,O,S,T,N)

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters known to be in the word AND in the correct positions: L (1st), E (2nd), A (3rd).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, S, T, N, K, Y.
- Missing letters: positions 4 and 5 must be filled from the remaining alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters.

Remaining common letters not yet tested or ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two letters for the 4th and 5th positions, forming a valid 5-letter word starting with L E A _ _. 

Possible words:
- LEADS (S is ruled out)
- LEAFY (Y ruled out, F not yet tested but word ends with F Y which is invalid)
- LEASH (S ruled out)
- LEAPT (T ruled out)
- LEACH (C and H not tested; H is valid)
- LEAGU (U not tested, but LEAGU isn't a word)
- LEAKY (already tried, K and Y ruled out)
- LEARN (R and N ruled out)
- LEAVE (V not tested)

LEAVE:
- L E A V E: positions 4 and 5 are V and E.
- E is already known to be in the word (2nd position), but it could appear again (words can have repeated letters).
- LEAVE is a valid word and uses V, which hasn't been tested yet.

LEACH:
- L E A C H: C and H haven't been tested yet.
- LEACH is a valid word.

Between LEAVE and LEACH, LEACH introduces two new untested letters (C, H), giving more information. So I'll choose LEACH.
