For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. Words with vowels and common consonants like 'S', 'T', 'R', 'N', 'L' are good choices. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

That’s ten different letters known not to be in the word.

Remaining vowels still available: I

A good next move is to pick a word that introduces several new high-frequency letters at once.  
“MICKY” uses M, I, C, K, Y — all still untested and fairly common.

So far the feedback has eliminated every letter we have guessed except for a single “I” which appeared in Guess 3 and was marked “-”, meaning it is somewhere in the word but not in the 2nd position.

Known impossible letters (after three guesses):
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D, M, C, K, Y

Remaining unused common letters include:
B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
plus the confirmed vowel I.

We need a five-letter word that:
- contains I (but not in position 2)
- avoids every letter already ruled out
- is a valid English word.

Quick scan of remaining consonants suggests looking for patterns like B _ I _ _, F _ I _ _, G _ I _ _, etc.  One valid word that satisfies all constraints is “BRISK”, but B and S have both been ruled out.  Another is “CHIMP”, but C, M, P are still available?  Wait—C, M, K, Y are already ruled out.  So we need to be careful.

Let’s list the available consonants that have NOT yet been guessed:
B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

And only the vowel I is confirmed; the other vowels (A, E, O, U) are ruled out. Therefore every remaining position must be filled with one of the permitted consonants, while ensuring the word contains I exactly once.

Scanning the dictionary, one word that fits is “FIZZY”.  
- Letters: F, I, Z, Z, Y  
But Y has been ruled out in Guess 3.  
Next attempt: “WHIFF” – contains H, W, F and I.  None of H, W, F have been tried yet.  This is valid.

Let’s verify:
- Length 5 ✓
- Contains I (not in position 2) ✓
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out ✓
- Valid English word ✓

Therefore WHIFF is a good next guess.
