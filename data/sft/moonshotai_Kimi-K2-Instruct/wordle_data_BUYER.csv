Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a strong starting word. The best initial guesses typically:
1. Use common letters from the most frequent English letters (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Include vowels to test vowel positions

Looking at common starting words, I could choose:
- SLATE (good coverage of frequent letters)
- CRANE (another strong choice)
- ADIEU (tests many vowels but lacks common consonants)

I'll go with SLATE as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many very common letters in different positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L (x) – not in the word.
- A (x) – not in the word.
- T (x) – not in the word.
- E (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So every letter except E is ruled out, and E must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

I should now pick a word that:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information (common unused consonants: N, R, C, H, D, M, B, G, etc.; vowels left: I, O, U… but E is already known).

A balanced choice that meets these criteria is “MERGE”:
- It includes E in position 2 (still testing a new position for E).
- It introduces M, R, G which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- It contains no ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a strong starting word. The best initial guesses typically:
1. Use common letters from the most frequent English letters (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Include vowels to test vowel positions

Looking at common starting words, I could choose:
- SLATE (good coverage of frequent letters)
- CRANE (another strong choice)
- ADIEU (tests many vowels but lacks common consonants)

I'll go with SLATE as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many very common letters in different positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

- L (x) – not in the word.
- A (x) – not in the word.
- T (x) – not in the word.
- E (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So every letter except E is ruled out, and E must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

I should now pick a word that:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information (common unused consonants: N, R, C, H, D, M, B, G, etc.; vowels left: I, O, U… but E is already known).

A balanced choice that meets these criteria is “MERGE”:
- It includes E in position 2 (still testing a new position for E).
- It introduces M, R, G which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- It contains no ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T).

From all feedback:

Remaining allowed consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining allowed vowels: O, U (A and I are out; E is already placed).

The first three positions must be filled with two consonants and one vowel (or vice versa) from the remaining allowed letters. We need a common 5-letter word pattern ending in “_ E R”.

Common patterns ending in “E R” with remaining letters:

Allowed: B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, O, U.

We need a valid word ending in _ E R. Possible candidates:
- C O W E R → but W is allowed, let’s check if C O W E R is a word: yes, “COWER”.
- B O W E R → yes, “BOWER”.
- P O W E R → yes, “POWER”.
- H O W E R → no, “HOWER” isn’t a word.
- F O U E R → no.
- C H U E R → no.
- C O P E R → yes, “COPER”.
- P O K E R → yes, “POKER”.
- P U R E R → but R is already in position 5, and duplicate R might or might not be allowed (but we have no info on duplicates).
- C U R E R → same issue with duplicate R.

Among these, “COWER”, “BOWER”, “POWER”, “COPER”, “POKER” are all valid. We need to pick one that uses new letters to maximize information.

“COWER” uses C, O, W, E, R. C, O, W are all new and allowed.
“BOWER” uses B, O, W, E, R. Similar.
“POWER” uses P, O, W, E, R.
“COPER” uses C, O, P, E, R.
“POKER” uses P, O, K, E, R.

Let’s choose “COWER” to test C, O, W in positions 1, 2, 3.

From all feedback:

- Positions 4 and 5 are locked: E R.
- Letters we now know are **not** in the word:  
  S, L, A, T, M, G, N, V, I, D, C, O, W  
  (every letter used in guesses 1–5 except E and R).

- Therefore the first three letters must come from the remaining, never-tested letters:  
  Consonants left: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, X, Y, Z  
  Vowels left: U

We have the pattern: _ _ U E R  
Only one vowel (U) is still available, so positions 2 or 3 must be U, and the other two positions must be consonants from the tiny remaining set.

Possible 5-letter English words fitting _ _ U E R with only consonants B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, X, Y, Z:

- B U Y E R → valid word and uses B, U, Y (all still allowed).  
- P U K E R → valid word, uses P, U, K (all still allowed).  
- H U K E R → not a common word.  
- F U Z E R → not a standard word.  

Between BUYER and PUKER, BUYER is more common and tests two new consonants (B, Y).  
So the logical next guess is BUYER.
