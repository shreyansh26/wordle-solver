For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc., I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it uses very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers multiple vowels and common consonants.

So far we know:
- E is in the word and is the 5th letter.
- S, L, A, and T are not in the word at all.

That leaves us needing a 5-letter word whose last letter is E and that contains none of S, L, A, or T.  
To maximize information on the second guess, I want to test consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, Z.

A balanced word that uses several new common letters and places a likely consonant in the first position is “CRIME.”  
- C, R, I, M have not been tested yet.  
- It ends in the known E.  
- It avoids all letters already eliminated (S, L, A, T).

If any of C, R, I, or M appears as ✓ or –, we gain immediate clues for subsequent guesses.

Current confirmed facts
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- C is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 3.

Letters already ruled-out (never appear):
S, L, A, T, R, M, B, N

Letters that must appear and their possible positions:
E (5)
I (possible spots: 1, 2, 4)
C (possible spots: 2, 4, but 4 is also a candidate for I)

Untested letters: D, F, G, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s try to place:
C in position 2, I in position 4, and pick new consonants for positions 1 and 3.
That gives us: _ C _ I E

Choose two fresh consonants: D and H
D C H I E → “DCHIE” is not a valid English word.
F C G I E → “FCGIE” invalid.
H C O I E → “HCOIE” invalid.
K C O I E → “KCOIE” invalid.

Looking for valid English words fitting C in 2, I in 4: “CHOIR”, “COVIE”, etc. – but most contain already-eliminated letters.

Alternative: place C in position 4 and I in position 2:
_ I _ C E

D I V C E → “DIVCE” invalid.

O I D C E → “OIDCE” invalid.

Try a different structure: start with I in position 1 and C in position 2:

Next, try:
I _ C _ E (I in 1, C in 3)
But feedback says C can’t be in position 3 (Guess 3: BICNE showed C(-) in position 3).

Let’s try:
_ _ I C E   (I in 3, C in 4)
But feedback says C can’t be in position 4 because it was ""-"" in position 4 in guess 3 (BICNE). Wait no – in BICNE, C was in position 3 and showed ""-"", so C in position 4 is still possible.

So pattern: _ _ I C E

V O I C E – uses V (new), O (new), I (must be present), C (must be present), E (fixed).
All criteria met, and it’s a valid English word.

Positions:
1: V (new)
2: O (new)
3: I (must be in word, allowed in 3)
4: C (must be in word, allowed in 4)
5: E (fixed)

No ruled-out letters used.

<guess>VOICE</guess>",VOICE,"Current confirmed facts
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- C is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 3.

Letters already ruled-out (never appear):
S, L, A, T, R, M, B, N

Letters that must appear and their possible positions:
E (5)
I (possible spots: 1, 2, 4)
C (possible spots: 2, 4, but 4 is also a candidate for I)

Untested letters: D, F, G, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s try to place:
C in position 2, I in position 4, and pick new consonants for positions 1 and 3.
That gives us: _ C _ I E
