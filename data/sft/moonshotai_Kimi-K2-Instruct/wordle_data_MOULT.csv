For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A well-known good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 distinct letters. This gives maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

From the feedback:
- A(x), R(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are **not** in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but **not** in the 3rd position.

So we know:
1. The word must contain the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. The word must **not** contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an O somewhere (but not in position 3).
- Does not have A, R, S, E.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow things down. Common 5-letter words that fit these constraints: ""DOING"", ""JOINT"", ""POINT"", ""COULD"", ""YOUTH"". Among these, ""POINT"" uses P, N, T which are still very common and informative.

Let's try ""POINT"":
- It has O in position 2 (allowed since O cannot be in position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T (none of which are A, R, S, E).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

So I will guess ""POINT"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - O  (now shown NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 by the CLOUT feedback)  
   - T  (in position 5)

3. So the secret word ends in T (position 5) and contains an O, but we still don’t know exactly where that O sits.  
   Current pattern: _ _ _ _ T with an O somewhere in the first four spots.

4. Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus any already ruled out).  
   From CLOUT we see:  
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.  
   Therefore the remaining letters L and U must appear somewhere in the first four positions, and we still need to place O as well.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends in T  
   - Contains O, L, and U  
   - Uses no forbidden letters (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C)  
   - Places L not in position 2 and U not in position 4.

Candidate words meeting these constraints:
   - LOUDT – invalid (not a word)  
   - LOFTY – has F, Y but doesn’t contain U and L.  
   - LOUSY – has S (forbidden).  
   - LOUT(S) – S is forbidden.  
   - TOUGH – lacks L.  
   - FOULT – F, O, U, L, T → fits perfectly: ends in T, has O, L, U, uses legal letters, places L in position 3 (allowed) and U in position 2 (allowed).

Hence “FOULT” satisfies every constraint.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A well-known good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 distinct letters. This gives maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x), R(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are **not** in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but **not** in the 3rd position.

So we know:
1. The word must contain the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. The word must **not** contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an O somewhere (but not in position 3).
- Does not have A, R, S, E.

A good next guess should introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow things down. Common 5-letter words that fit these constraints: ""DOING"", ""JOINT"", ""POINT"", ""COULD"", ""YOUTH"". Among these, ""POINT"" uses P, N, T which are still very common and informative.

Let's try ""POINT"":
- It has O in position 2 (allowed since O cannot be in position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T (none of which are A, R, S, E).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

So I will guess ""POINT"".

- Letters that ARE in the word (and their positions):
  – O in position 2 (✓)  
  – T in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ T, and the missing letters must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, S, E, P, I, N).

Focusing on still-common consonants and vowels we have left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

A useful next word should:
1. Keep O in position 2 and T in position 5.  
2. Introduce new letters not yet tested.  
3. Favor common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words matching _ O _ _ T:
- BLOWT – invalid (not a word)
- CLOUT – uses C, L, U (all still allowed)
- GLOUT – uncommon
- MOUNT – uses M, U, N (but N is out)
- COBUT – uncommon
