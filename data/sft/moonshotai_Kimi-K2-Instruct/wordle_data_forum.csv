- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly. Common starting words like SLATE, CRANE, or ARISE are often recommended, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S) which should give useful feedback about letter placement and presence in the secret word.

From the first feedback:
- A: x → not in the word

- O: - → in the word, wrong position (not position 3)  
- S: x → not in the word  
- E: x → not in the word

- Does NOT contain A, S, E  
- Contains R (not in position 2)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R and O  
- Doesn’t have A, S, E  
- R is not in position 2  
- O is not in position 3  

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (only O was confirmed so far)

Let’s pick a word that places R somewhere other than position 2 and O somewhere other than position 3.  
""FRONT"" is a candidate:  
- F, R, O, N, T  
- R is in position 2 → violates the R(-) feedback (R can’t be in position 2) → discard.  

""ROUND"":  
- R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), no A/S/E → good.

Consolidating the two rounds of feedback:

Letters we KNOW:
- O is in the word AND in the exact position 2 (from Guess 2: O(✓) in the 2nd spot).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 R(-) and Guess 2 R(-)).
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (Guess 2: U(-)).
- A, S, E, N, D are NOT in the word.

So the secret word looks like:
_ O _ _ _
with remaining letters to find among: R, U, and three others chosen from the still-allowed consonants (T, L, C, M, etc.) and possibly the vowel I (since we haven’t ruled I out yet).

R must go somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
U must go somewhere not in position 3.

Let’s try to place R and U while introducing new consonants. A promising pattern is:
R _ O _ _  (but O is fixed at position 2, so that’s not possible)
_ O R _ _ (R in position 3)
_ O _ R _ (R in position 4)
_ O _ _ R (R in position 5)

And U must slot into one of the remaining spots not already taken by O or R.

Let’s test “MORUL” – but L hasn’t been tried; however, M, O, R, U, L are all still legal. Yet “MORUL” isn’t a common word. A more common word with the same idea is “CORGI” – but we haven’t tested C or G or I yet. However, from the feedback, we already know:
- C and G are still possible, but we want to stay simple.

A simple, common word that fits:
- O in position 2
- R in position 3
- U in either 1 or 4 or 5
- plus two new consonants from the still-allowed set.

A good candidate is “TROOP” but double O isn’t helpful, and P hasn’t been tested. Wait, we haven’t ruled out P, but we’d rather test new letters.

Another candidate is “FORUM”:
- F, O, R, U, M
- O is in position 2 – ✓
- R is in position 3 – allowed (R only excluded from 1 and 2)
- U is in position 4 – allowed (not position 3)
- F and M are new, still allowed letters
- No A/S/E/N/D

“FORUM” is a valid, common word that satisfies all constraints.

So I will guess FORUM.
