For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give good information about the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
This should provide good coverage for eliminating or confirming many possible letters.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – S is still correct in position 5.  
   – I is somewhere in the word (wrong position in TUNIS), so I appears but NOT in position 4.  
   – T, U, N are all absent.

Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, T, U, N

Remaining candidate letters (unused so far, not yet ruled out):
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Y Z

We know:
- Position 5 is S.
- I is present but not in position 4, so I must be in 1, 2, 3, or (unlikely) 4 again but that’s already ruled out, so positions 1-3 only.
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining pool.

Good common consonants still available: L, D, G, H, M, P, C, B, K

A vowel other than I isn’t needed because I is already in the word and the other vowels (A, O, U, E) are excluded. So we can use consonants.

Let’s aim for a word that puts I in position 2 and uses common consonants: L, M, K, etc.

Try “LIMBS”:
- L – still allowed  
- I – must be in the word  
- M – still allowed  
- B – still allowed  
- S – fixed in position 5  

But I is in position 2; we don’t yet know that’s correct, but it’s a valid test because I must appear somewhere 1-3. The word fits all constraints.

- Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and S (already used in positions)

We need three more letters from the allowed pool for positions 1-4. Since I must be at 1 or 3, let’s try a word with I at position 1.

Good consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y
A plausible word: I D Y S ? — but 5 letters needed. Let’s try ""ICKYS"" but that’s 5 letters: I C K Y S.

""ICONS"" – has O (banned).  
""IDYLS"" – has L (banned).  
""KIDDS"" – has D twice, unlikely, plus K, I, D, D, S.  

Wait – ""KIDDS"" is 5 letters, uses K, I, D, D, S. D isn’t banned yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give good information about the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
This should provide good coverage for eliminating or confirming many possible letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells me:

- S is correct in position 5 (✓).
- A, R, O, E are all not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

Remaining candidate letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need 4 more letters (positions 1–4) from that list. I want common consonants and a vowel besides A, O, E. Vowels left: I, U, Y.

Good choices: U or I for a vowel, plus consonants like T, N, L, M.

Let me try a word that uses U and some frequent remaining consonants: T, N, L.

A possible word: TUNIS.
- Ends in S (matches what we know).
- Uses U (vowel), T, N, I.
- None of A, R, O, E are used.

Let's go with TUNIS.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – S is still correct in position 5.  
   – I is somewhere in the word (wrong position in TUNIS), so I appears but NOT in position 4.  
   – T, U, N are all absent.

Letters now known to be in the word: I, S  
Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, T, U, N

Remaining candidate letters (unused so far, not yet ruled out):
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Y Z

We know:
- Position 5 is S.
- I is present but not in position 4, so I must be in 1, 2, 3, or (unlikely) 4 again but that’s already ruled out, so positions 1-3 only.
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining pool.

Good common consonants still available: L, D, G, H, M, P, C, B, K

A vowel other than I isn’t needed because I is already in the word and the other vowels (A, O, U, E) are excluded. So we can use consonants.

Let’s aim for a word that puts I in position 2 and uses common consonants: L, M, K, etc.

Try “LIMBS”:
- L – still allowed  
- I – must be in the word  
- M – still allowed  
- B – still allowed  
- S – fixed in position 5  

But I is in position 2; we don’t yet know that’s correct, but it’s a valid test because I must appear somewhere 1-3. The word fits all constraints.

Let's list what we now know from all four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but not at position 4.  
   – T, U, N are not in the word.

3. LIMBS → L(x) I(-) M(x) B(x) S(-)

   – S is at position 5.

So the word now looks like:
_ H I _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, U, N, L, M, B, C, P.

Remaining candidate letters (from the alphabet letters not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining pool. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit _ H I _ S.

Possible candidates:
DHIRS – not a word
FHIRS – not a word
GHIS? – no
JHIRS – no
KHIRS – no
WHIRS – yes, a real word: ""WHIRS"" (present tense of whir).

Let's check ""WHIRS"":
- W is not yet ruled out.
- H is at position 2 (✓).
- I is at position 3 (✓).
- R is ruled out from previous guesses (R was in AROSE and marked x), so R is not in the word.  
Wait, ""WHIRS"" has an R – which is ruled out. So ""WHIRS"" is invalid.

Next, let's list possible valid words fitting _ H I _ S with remaining letters.

Letters allowed for positions 1 and 4: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- H I D S – need 5 letters.  
Actually, we need to form a real 5-letter word ending in S with H at 2, I at 3.

Looking at the remaining letters:
- Position 1: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Real English words fitting _ H I _ S:
- DHIBS – not a word
- FHIBS – no
- GHIBS – no
- JHIBS – no
- KHIBS – no
- V... no common words
- WHIKS – not a word
- YHIBS – no
- ZHIBS – no

Wait, let's consider ""DHIBS"" isn't valid. Is there any valid word?

Actually, ""SHINS"" was considered earlier but has N (ruled out).  
""SWISH"" – no, W not at 1, and H at 2.  
""CHITS"" – C is ruled out.  

Realizing the pool is limited:  
""WHIDS"" – not a common word.  
""WHIPS"" – P is ruled out.  
""WHIGS"" – G is allowed, but does it fit? W H I G S – yes, ""WHIGS"" is a valid word referring to members of a 19th-century US political faction.

Check letters: W, H, I, G, S – none of these are ruled out except we must confirm:
- W: not ruled out (not in any previous guess)
- G: not ruled out
- H, I, S: confirmed correct positions or presence.

Thus, ""WHIGS"" fits perfectly:
- Position 1: W (allowed)
- Position 2: H (✓)
- Position 3: I (✓)
- Position 4: G (allowed)
- Position 5: S (✓)

<guess>WHIGS</guess>",WHIGS,"Let's list what we now know from all four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – The word ends in S (position 5).  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but not at position 4.  
   – T, U, N are not in the word.

3. LIMBS → L(x) I(-) M(x) B(x) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but not at position 2.  
   – L, M, B are not in the word.

4. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct at position 2.  
   – I is correct at position 3.  
   – C, P are not in the word.  
   – S is at position 5.

So the word now looks like:
_ H I _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, U, N, L, M, B, C, P.

Remaining candidate letters (from the alphabet letters not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining pool. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit _ H I _ S.

Possible candidates:
DHIRS – not a word
FHIRS – not a word
GHIS? – no
JHIRS – no
KHIRS – no
WHIRS – yes, a real word: ""WHIRS"" (present tense of whir).

Let's check ""WHIRS"":
- W is not yet ruled out.
- H is at position 2 (✓).
- I is at position 3 (✓).
- R is ruled out from previous guesses (R was in AROSE and marked x), so R is not in the word.  
Wait, ""WHIRS"" has an R – which is ruled out. So ""WHIRS"" is invalid.

Next, let's list possible valid words fitting _ H I _ S with remaining letters.

Letters allowed for positions 1 and 4: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- H I D S – need 5 letters.  
Actually, we need to form a real 5-letter word ending in S with H at 2, I at 3.

Looking at the remaining letters:
- Position 1: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WHISK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give good information about the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
This should provide good coverage for eliminating or confirming many possible letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells me:

- S is correct in position 5 (✓).
- A, R, O, E are all not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

Remaining candidate letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need 4 more letters (positions 1–4) from that list. I want common consonants and a vowel besides A, O, E. Vowels left: I, U, Y.

Good choices: U or I for a vowel, plus consonants like T, N, L, M.

Let me try a word that uses U and some frequent remaining consonants: T, N, L.

A possible word: TUNIS.
- Ends in S (matches what we know).
- Uses U (vowel), T, N, I.
- None of A, R, O, E are used.

Let's go with TUNIS.

<guess>TUNIS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TUNIS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – The word ends with S and contains no A, R, O, E.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – S is still correct in position 5.  
   – I is somewhere in the word (wrong position in TUNIS), so I appears but NOT in position 4.  
   – T, U, N are all absent.

Letters now known to be in the word: I, S  
Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, T, U, N

Remaining candidate letters (unused so far, not yet ruled out):
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Y Z

We know:
- Position 5 is S.
- I is present but not in position 4, so I must be in 1, 2, 3, or (unlikely) 4 again but that’s already ruled out, so positions 1-3 only.
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining pool.

Good common consonants still available: L, D, G, H, M, P, C, B, K

A vowel other than I isn’t needed because I is already in the word and the other vowels (A, O, U, E) are excluded. So we can use consonants.

Let’s aim for a word that puts I in position 2 and uses common consonants: L, M, K, etc.

Try “LIMBS”:
- L – still allowed  
- I – must be in the word  
- M – still allowed  
- B – still allowed  
- S – fixed in position 5  

But I is in position 2; we don’t yet know that’s correct, but it’s a valid test because I must appear somewhere 1-3. The word fits all constraints.

<guess>LIMBS</guess>

Guess 2: TUNIS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)
Guess 3: LIMBS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(-) M(x) B(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   - Word ends with S (position 5).  
   - Letters A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   - S is confirmed at position 5; since it’s marked “-” here, it must be at position 5 (already ✓ from first guess).  
   - I is in the word but NOT at position 4.  

3. LIMBS → L(x) I(-) M(x) B(x) S(-)  
   - L, M, B are not in the word.  
   - I is in the word but NOT at position 2.  
   - S is again confirmed at position 5.

Known so far:
- Position 5: S
- I must appear at position 1 or 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out for I)
- Letters banned: A, R, O, E, T, U, N, L, M, B
- Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus I and S (already used in positions)

We need three more letters from the allowed pool for positions 1-4. Since I must be at 1 or 3, let’s try a word with I at position 1.

Good consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y
A plausible word: I D Y S ? — but 5 letters needed. Let’s try ""ICKYS"" but that’s 5 letters: I C K Y S.  
Or ""IVYDS""? Doesn’t seem like a word.  
A better attempt: ""ICKYS"" is not valid.  
Another: ""ICILY"" – no, ends in Y.  
""ICONS"" – has O (banned).  
""IDYLS"" – has L (banned).  
""KIDDS"" – has D twice, unlikely, plus K, I, D, D, S.  

Wait – ""KIDDS"" is 5 letters, uses K, I, D, D, S. D isn’t banned yet.  
But double D seems less likely.  

A more common word: ""CHIPS"" – but P is allowed, C, H, I, P, S.  
Check:  
- C, H, I, P not yet ruled out.  
- I is at position 3, which is allowed (positions 1 or 3).  
- Ends with S.  
- No banned letters.

Let’s go with ""CHIPS"".

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's list what we now know from all four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – The word ends in S (position 5).  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.

2. TUNIS → T(x) U(x) N(x) I(-) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but not at position 4.  
   – T, U, N are not in the word.

3. LIMBS → L(x) I(-) M(x) B(x) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but not at position 2.  
   – L, M, B are not in the word.

4. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is correct at position 2.  
   – I is correct at position 3.  
   – C, P are not in the word.  
   – S is at position 5.

So the word now looks like:
_ H I _ S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, U, N, L, M, B, C, P.

Remaining candidate letters (from the alphabet letters not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining pool. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit _ H I _ S.

Possible candidates:
DHIRS – not a word
FHIRS – not a word
GHIS? – no
JHIRS – no
KHIRS – no
WHIRS – yes, a real word: ""WHIRS"" (present tense of whir).

Let's check ""WHIRS"":
- W is not yet ruled out.
- H is at position 2 (✓).
- I is at position 3 (✓).
- R is ruled out from previous guesses (R was in AROSE and marked x), so R is not in the word.  
Wait, ""WHIRS"" has an R – which is ruled out. So ""WHIRS"" is invalid.

Next, let's list possible valid words fitting _ H I _ S with remaining letters.

Letters allowed for positions 1 and 4: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- H I D S – need 5 letters.  
Actually, we need to form a real 5-letter word ending in S with H at 2, I at 3.

Looking at the remaining letters:
- Position 1: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Real English words fitting _ H I _ S:
- DHIBS – not a word
- FHIBS – no
- GHIBS – no
- JHIBS – no
- KHIBS – no
- V... no common words
- WHIKS – not a word
- YHIBS – no
- ZHIBS – no

Wait, let's consider ""DHIBS"" isn't valid. Is there any valid word?

Actually, ""SHINS"" was considered earlier but has N (ruled out).  
""SWISH"" – no, W not at 1, and H at 2.  
""CHITS"" – C is ruled out.  

Realizing the pool is limited:  
""WHIDS"" – not a common word.  
""WHIPS"" – P is ruled out.  
""WHIGS"" – G is allowed, but does it fit? W H I G S – yes, ""WHIGS"" is a valid word referring to members of a 19th-century US political faction.

Check letters: W, H, I, G, S – none of these are ruled out except we must confirm:
- W: not ruled out (not in any previous guess)
- G: not ruled out
- H, I, S: confirmed correct positions or presence.

Thus, ""WHIGS"" fits perfectly:
- Position 1: W (allowed)

From all feedback so far the word is now known to look like:

W H I _ S

Letters already placed:
- Position 1: W ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 5: S ✓

Only the 4th letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out (from earlier guesses):  
A, R, O, E, T, U, N, L, M, B, C, P, G  

That leaves a very small pool of still-available consonants:  
D, F, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z  

Of these, only “D, F, K” are common enough to appear in everyday 5-letter English words ending “WHIS”.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit:
- WHIDS  
- WHIFS  
- WHIPS → P already excluded  
- WHISK  

Among these, “WHISK” uses K, which is not yet ruled out, and is a common word.

Therefore the only remaining plausible candidate is WHISK.
