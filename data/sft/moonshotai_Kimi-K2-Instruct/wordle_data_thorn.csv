For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Common 5-letter words like ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular choices because they include frequent letters. ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 consonants, which is efficient. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong set. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
1. A(x) – A is not in the word.
2. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
3. O(✓) – O is in the word and is in position 3.
4. S(x) – S is not in the word.
5. E(x) – E is not in the word.

What we know so far:
- The word has an O in the third position: _ _ O _ _
- It contains the letter R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Letters A, S, E are excluded.
- We have not yet tested T, N, I, L, C, etc.

A good next guess would:
1. Keep the confirmed O in position 3.
2. Try to place R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already O).
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A strong candidate is “FRONT”:
- F – new
- R – repositioned to position 2 (allowed, since R was not in position 2 previously)
- O – confirmed at 3
- N – new
- T – new

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
2. FRONT → F(x) R(-) O(✓) N(-) T(-)

Key deductions:
- Position 3 is definitely O.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 1.
- N and T are in the word but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively (they’re “wrong position”).
- A, S, E, F are ruled out entirely.

So far we have:
_ _ O _ _
R must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so R must be in 4 or 5.
N and T must each be somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not the positions they were just tried in).

We need a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Puts R in 4 or 5.
- Places N and T elsewhere among 1,2,4,5 without repeating their old spots.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate structure:
- If R is in position 4: _ _ O R _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ O _ R

Let’s try the first structure and pick common remaining letters like T and N in positions 1 and 2:
T R O _ N  → but R would be in 2 (disallowed).
T _ O R N  → N in 5 (ok, T in 1, R in 4, N in 5, O in 3) → T O R N ? No, TORN has O in 2 (wrong).
T _ O R N → T O R N is 4 letters, so we need 5.

Wait, we can use the combination T, N, R, O plus another unused letter (no A,E,S,F). A good 5-letter word with these constraints is **TROOP**, but P hasn’t been tested yet and we have only one O confirmed, so double O is risky.

Another word: **TRON** + a letter → **TRONA** – no, A is gone.
**THORN** – H is new, fits:
- T is in 1 (allowed, not in 5)
- H is new
- O in 3 ✓
- R in 4 (allowed, not in 1 or 2)
- N in 5 (allowed, not in 4)
