Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback to work from, I should choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating letters. 

Some good options might be:
- ""AROSE"" (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- ""RAISE"" (uses R, A, I, S, E)
- ""STARE"" (uses S, T, A, R, E)

""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess as it uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any repeats, which should give good feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE – A, R, O, S, E – are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word that contains any of those letters.

1. Letters we can now rule out: A, R, O, S, E  
2. Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, F, B, G, K, Y, W  
3. Remaining common vowels: I, U  
4. Goal: pick a 5-letter English word made only from the still-allowed letters, ideally re-using no letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – uses T, I, U, N, L  
- UPLIT (U, P, L, I, T) – uses U, P, L, I, T  
- UNION (U, N, I, O, N) – but O is already out  
- TUBIC – uses B, C, which are allowed, but “TUBIC” is less common  
- UNTIL is a well-known word and uses five distinct still-legitimate letters.

Therefore, “UNTIL” is a strong next guess.

Letters we now know are definitely out:

U, L

Remaining letters that have not been tested yet (and are still legal):

We need a 5-letter word that:

- does NOT contain any of the banned letters (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I),
- and keeps U and L away from the positions they occupied in UNTIL (U in spot 1, L in spot 5).

Possible words fitting those constraints:

From the feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (correct position or wrong position):
- U – we know it is in position 2 (✓ in BULKY)
- L – still in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- K – we know it is in position 5 (✓ in BULKY)
- Y – we know it is in position 4 (✓ in BULKY)

Letters known to be absent (x):
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, B

So far the pattern looks like: _ U _ Y K (positions 2,4,5 are locked in; position 1 and 3 are unknown, but L cannot be in position 3).

Letters still allowed and not yet placed: C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus L (but L cannot be in spot 3; it could be in spot 1).

We need a 5-letter English word matching the pattern: ? U ? Y K, where the first and third letters are from the remaining allowed letters and the third letter is NOT L (because L is already known to be in the word but cannot be in position 3). 

Also, the first letter could be L (since L only can't be in position 3).

Let’s list possible words:

- L U _ Y K: need a 3rd letter that is allowed and forms a word.
  - L U C Y K → LUCKY – valid word and uses C (still allowed).
  - L U F Y K → no such word.
  - L U D Y K → no such word.
  
- _ U _ Y K with first letter not L:
  - C U L Y K → CULKY – not a standard English word.
  - F U L Y K → not a word.
  - D U L Y K → not a word.
  - M U C Y K → not a word.

Only valid word fitting the pattern and constraints is LUCKY.

But wait – we know L is in the word (from feedback on UNTIL: L(-)), and we also know it cannot be in position 3 (from BULKY feedback: L(-) means it is not in position 3). However, in LUCKY, L is in position 1, which is still allowed because our only constraint on L is that it is not in position 3 (and not in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by K). 

Thus, LUCKY is valid.

We could also check if there are any other words, but LUCKY seems the only common 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _U_YK with the given constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LUCKY.
