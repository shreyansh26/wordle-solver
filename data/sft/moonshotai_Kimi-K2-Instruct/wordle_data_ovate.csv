Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - good coverage)
- ROATE (uses R, O, A, T, E - hits many vowels)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels but less consonant info)

CRANE is generally considered one of the best starting words as it contains very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowels (A, E). This gives good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early.

From the first guess CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  
So we know the word ends with AE and does **not** contain C, R, N.  
We still need to find the first three letters: _ _ _ A E.

Letters to try next should avoid C, R, N and should include common consonants that weren’t used. Good candidates are S, T, L, D, P, B, M, etc.

A solid second-guess word that obeys these rules is STALE:

- It keeps A (4th) and E (5th) in place while testing new letters in positions 1, 2, 3.

Another option is PLATE, but STALE tests S and T which are very frequent.

From the two previous guesses:

- Word ends in AE (positions 4 and 5 confirmed).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, S, L.
- Letters to work with (known so far): A, E, T.
   – T is present but is NOT in position 2, because in STALE it was marked “-” (wrong position).

So the pattern must be: _ _ T A E  
(only place T can fit is position 3).

Consonants and vowels still unused and common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that is _ _ T A E and uses only available letters.

Quick mental scan of English words ending “TAE”:
- CHATE? (no H yet, probably okay)
- GLATE? (no, G not ruled out, but not listed in common usage)
- PLATE? (P okay, L already ruled out – no)
- BLATE? (B okay, L ruled out – no)
- GHATE? (H okay, not ruled out, but uncommon)
- WHATE? (no W test yet, but uncommon)
- CHATE? (H hasn’t been tried; CHATE is a variant spelling, but CHATE is acceptable in many word lists)

The most common, valid 5-letter word that matches _ _ T A E and uses only letters not eliminated is:

Guess 2: STALE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(✓) L(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

- Word ends in AE (positions 4 and 5 confirmed).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, S, L.
- Letters to work with (known so far): A, E, T.
   – T is present but is NOT in position 2, because in STALE it was marked “-” (wrong position).

So the pattern must be: _ _ T A E  
(only place T can fit is position 3).

Consonants and vowels still unused and common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that is _ _ T A E and uses only available letters.

Quick mental scan of English words ending “TAE”:
- CHATE? (no H yet, probably okay)
- GLATE? (no, G not ruled out, but not listed in common usage)
- PLATE? (P okay, L already ruled out – no)
- BLATE? (B okay, L ruled out – no)
- GHATE? (H okay, not ruled out, but uncommon)
- WHATE? (no W test yet, but uncommon)
- CHATE? (H hasn’t been tried; CHATE is a variant spelling, but CHATE is acceptable in many word lists)

The most common, valid 5-letter word that matches _ _ T A E and uses only letters not eliminated is:
CHATE (uses C, H, A, T, E – C was eliminated, so CHATE is invalid! Oops.)

Backtrack: valid dictionary words ending TAE:  
- STATE (S eliminated)  
- PLATE (L eliminated)  
- CRATE (C, R eliminated)  
- GRATE (G, R eliminated)  
- THATE (not a word)  
- WHATE (not a word)  
- BLATE (L eliminated)  
- FLATE (not a word)  
- SLATE (S, L eliminated)  
- GLATE (not a word)  
- PHATE (not a word)  
- BHATE (not a word)

Only remaining common word I see that fits _ _ T A E and uses only untested letters is:

GHATE – not in standard dictionary.

Wait, let’s systematically list every 5-letter word ending in TAE:

- abate → A already in place at 4, so first three letters must be _ B A T E → no, pattern is _ _ T A E  
Correct pattern is _ _ T A E.

Valid words ending in TAE:
agate → a g a t e → g at 2, t at 3 → agate is 5 letters but ends in TAE? No, ends ATE.  
blate → blate ends ATE not TAE.  
Wait, we need word positions 3=T, 4=A, 5=E.

So the word must be of form: ??TAE.

Scrabble / common 5-letter English words that end TAE:
- The only two I can find are:
  – GATAE (not a word)  
  – KATAE (not a word)  
  – RATAE (not a word)  
  – PATAE (not a word)  
  – MATAE (not a word)  
  – BUTAE (not a word)  
  – HUTAE (not a word)  

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter English words that have T as 3rd letter, A as 4th, E as 5th.  That is, pattern ??TAE.

Looking at my mental list / quick scan:

- BITAE? no  
- CITAE? no  
- DITAE? no  
- FITAE? no  
- GITAE? no  
- HITAE? no  
- JITAE? no  
- KITAE? no  
- LITAE? no  
- MITAE? no  
- NITAE? no  
- PITAE? no  
- QITAE? no  
- RITAE? no  
- SITAE? no  
- TITAE? no  
- VITAE? yes – VITAE (plural of vita) is a valid 5-letter word.

V hasn’t been used yet; I, T, A, E are all allowed (T is in word, A and E are confirmed in positions, I not tested yet).  
So VITAE is valid.

Other possibilities:
- YITAE? no  
- WITAE? no  
- FITAE? no  

VITAE is the only standard 5-letter word that fits the discovered pattern and uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated.

Therefore, the logical next guess is VITAE.

From the three clues we have:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E (E locked in 5th spot).
2. Letters ruled out: C, R, N, S, L, I.
3. Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A and T.
   - A is NOT in 4th place (it was marked “-” in VITAE), so A must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - T is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (all marked “-” in previous turns), so T must be in position 1.

Hence the skeleton is: T _ _ A E.

We have to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that have not been used or eliminated yet (anything not in {C, R, N, S, L, I}).

Common English 5-letter words that fit T _ _ A E:
- TUBAE (plural of tuba) – letters T, U, B, A, E; B and U untested.
- TUMAE – not a word.
- TULAE – not a word.
- TUGAE – not a word.
- TUMBA – not a word.
- TUBAE is the only one that appears valid.

Another quick check: T = 1st, A = 4th, E = 5th, and we need two new letters in 2 and 3. B and U are still available. So TUBAE is perfectly valid and uses only fresh letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Key facts extracted from all feedback:

- Word ends in **…A E** is impossible, because in Guess 4 (TUBAE) A was marked “-” in position 4, meaning A is NOT in position 4.
- But in Guess 1 (CRANE) A was marked ✓ in position 4.  
  These two results are contradictory; the only resolution is that **A is NOT in the word at all** and the original ✓ in CRANE position 4 must have contained a typo.  (In standard Wordle rules a letter cannot simultaneously be ✓ and later “-” in the same position.)

Accepting the typo correction, the true state is:

- E is the only confirmed letter, locked in position 5.
- Letters known to be absent: C, R, N, S, L, I, U, B, V.
- T is in the word but has been tried unsuccessfully in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, so the only remaining place for T is position 1.

Skeleton: T _ _ _ E.

We now need three new, unused, common consonants for positions 2-3-4 (excluding the eliminated set).  
F, G, H, D, M, P, K, Y, W are all still allowed.

Looking for common English 5-letter words T _ _ _ E that avoid all disallowed letters:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - good coverage)
- ROATE (uses R, O, A, T, E - hits many vowels)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels but less consonant info)

CRANE is generally considered one of the best starting words as it contains very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowels (A, E). This gives good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
  
So we know the word ends with AE and does **not** contain C, R, N.  
We still need to find the first three letters: _ _ _ A E.

Letters to try next should avoid C, R, N and should include common consonants that weren’t used. Good candidates are S, T, L, D, P, B, M, etc.

A solid second-guess word that obeys these rules is STALE:
- S, T, L haven’t been tested yet.
- It keeps A (4th) and E (5th) in place while testing new letters in positions 1, 2, 3.

Another option is PLATE, but STALE tests S and T which are very frequent.

- Word ends in AE (positions 4 and 5 confirmed).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, S, L.
- Letters to work with (known so far): A, E, T.
   – T is present but is NOT in position 2, because in STALE it was marked “-” (wrong position).

So the pattern must be: _ _ T A E  
(only place T can fit is position 3).

Consonants and vowels still unused and common: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.  
We need a 5-letter word that is _ _ T A E and uses only available letters.

Quick mental scan of English words ending “TAE”:
- CHATE? (no H yet, probably okay)
- GLATE? (no, G not ruled out, but not listed in common usage)
- PLATE? (P okay, L already ruled out – no)
- BLATE? (B okay, L ruled out – no)
- GHATE? (H okay, not ruled out, but uncommon)
- WHATE? (no W test yet, but uncommon)
- CHATE? (H hasn’t been tried; CHATE is a variant spelling, but CHATE is acceptable in many word lists)

The most common, valid 5-letter word that matches _ _ T A E and uses only letters not eliminated is:
CHATE (uses C, H, A, T, E – C was eliminated, so CHATE is invalid! Oops.)

Backtrack: valid dictionary words ending TAE:  
- STATE (S eliminated)  
- PLATE (L eliminated)  
- CRATE (C, R eliminated)  
- GRATE (G, R eliminated)  
- THATE (not a word)  
- WHATE (not a word)  
- BLATE (L eliminated)  
- FLATE (not a word)  
- SLATE (S, L eliminated)  
- GLATE (not a word)  
- PHATE (not a word)  
- BHATE (not a word)

Only remaining common word I see that fits _ _ T A E and uses only untested letters is:

GHATE – not in standard dictionary.

Wait, let’s systematically list every 5-letter word ending in TAE:

- abate → A already in place at 4, so first three letters must be _ B A T E → no, pattern is _ _ T A E  
Correct pattern is _ _ T A E.

Valid words ending in TAE:
agate → a g a t e → g at 2, t at 3 → agate is 5 letters but ends in TAE? No, ends ATE.  
blate → blate ends ATE not TAE.  
Wait, we need word positions 3=T, 4=A, 5=E.

So the word must be of form: ??TAE.

Scrabble / common 5-letter English words that end TAE:
- The only two I can find are:
  – GATAE (not a word)  
  – KATAE (not a word)  
  – RATAE (not a word)  
  – PATAE (not a word)  
  – MATAE (not a word)  
  – BUTAE (not a word)  
  – HUTAE (not a word)  

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter English words that have T as 3rd letter, A as 4th, E as 5th.  That is, pattern ??TAE.

Looking at my mental list / quick scan:

- BITAE? no  
- CITAE? no  
- DITAE? no  
- FITAE? no  
- GITAE? no  
- HITAE? no  
- JITAE? no  
- KITAE? no  
- LITAE? no  
- MITAE? no  
- NITAE? no  
- PITAE? no  
- QITAE? no  
- RITAE? no  
- SITAE? no  
- TITAE? no  
- VITAE? yes – VITAE (plural of vita) is a valid 5-letter word.

V hasn’t been used yet; I, T, A, E are all allowed (T is in word, A and E are confirmed in positions, I not tested yet).  
So VITAE is valid.

Other possibilities:
- YITAE? no  
- WITAE? no  
- FITAE? no  

VITAE is the only standard 5-letter word that fits the discovered pattern and uses only letters that haven’t been eliminated.

Therefore, the logical next guess is VITAE.

   - A is NOT in 4th place (it was marked “-” in VITAE), so A must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
   - T is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (all marked “-” in previous turns), so T must be in position 1.

Hence the skeleton is: T _ _ A E.

We have to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that have not been used or eliminated yet (anything not in {C, R, N, S, L, I}).

Common English 5-letter words that fit T _ _ A E:
- TUBAE (plural of tuba) – letters T, U, B, A, E; B and U untested.
- TUMAE – not a word.
- TULAE – not a word.
- TUGAE – not a word.
- TUMBA – not a word.
- TUBAE is the only one that appears valid.

Another quick check: T = 1st, A = 4th, E = 5th, and we need two new letters in 2 and 3. B and U are still available. So TUBAE is perfectly valid and uses only fresh letters.

From the five guesses we now know:

Confirmed:
- E is in position 5.

Eliminated letters (never appear anywhere):  
C, R, N, S, L, I, U, B, V, H, Y, M, A (because A was ✓ in CRANE position 4, then “-” in positions 2,3,4 in later guesses – a contradiction that can only be resolved if A is actually absent).

We therefore need three fresh consonants for positions 1-2-3 and any vowel that hasn’t been ruled out for position 4.

Still-allowed consonants (not yet used): D, F, G, K, P, W, Z …  
Still-allowed vowels for position 4 (excluding A, I, U): O.

A common 5-letter English word that ends in OE and uses only fresh letters is “GLOVE”, but V is eliminated; “FROZE” uses Z and R (R eliminated); “PROBE” uses B (eliminated).  
The simplest word that fits with remaining letters is “DROVE”, but again R is gone.  
Going through the remaining consonants and the single available vowel O for position 4, the only practical English word left is “GLOVE” (invalid), “FROZE” (invalid), “PROBE” (invalid).

Realizing the vowel in position 4 must still be O (only vowel left), and consonants left must be chosen from D, F, G, K, P, W, Z, the actual remaining possibilities are very few.  
The only valid dictionary word ending _ _ _ O E that avoids every eliminated letter is **FROZE** (R eliminated), **GLOZE**, **KLOZE** (Z is still valid), but they all contain eliminated letters.  
The correct remaining candidate is **PROBE** (B eliminated) – none work.

Upon careful re-evaluation, the last remaining common word that uses only still-available letters and fits _ _ _ O E is **GLOZE** (G, L, O, Z, E), but L is eliminated.  
Rechecking, the consonants left in positions 1-2-3 must be from D, F, G, K, P, W, Z and position 4 must be O:

The only common word is **GLOZE**, but L is out.  
Going through systematically:  
D _ _ O E → DROVE (R out)  
F _ _ O E → FROZE (R out)  
G _ _ O E → GLOZE (L out)  
K _ _ O E → KROZE (R out)  
P _ _ O E → PROBE (B, R out)  
W _ _ O E → WROKE (R out)  
Z _ _ O E → ZONGE (not English)

Realising this exhaustive check shows no valid common word left, the only possibility is a less common but still accepted word: **KEDGE** (K, E, D, G, E) – but E is already in position 5 and this doesn’t fit _ _ _ O E.  

The pattern must be _ _ _ O E with letters only from the remaining pool. The valid remaining word is **PODGE** (P, O, D, G, E) – but D, G, P are still allowed.  **PODGE** is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus the final candidate is PODGE.
