- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. Common English letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess should use diverse vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Popular starting words include:
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for both vowels and consonants.

  A, R, I, S, E, L, D  

- Letters that **are in the word** (position still unknown):  
  C (correct in 1st position), O (somewhere), U (somewhere)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with C.
2. Contains both O and U.
3. Uses none of the eliminated letters (A, R, I, S, E, L, D).

Remaining plausible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-confirmed O and U.

Candidate words:
- COULD – but ‘L’ and ‘D’ are already out.
- COUTH – uses T and H (both still legal), and contains O and U.
- CONCH – only has O, not U.
- CUPID – uses I and D, both out.
- CUT UP – 6 letters, invalid.
- CYTON – uses Y and T (legal), and contains O and U.

Among these, **COUTH** is a valid 5-letter word, begins with C, and uses both O and U without any banned letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. C is locked as the first letter (✓ in position 1 on all guesses).
2. O, U, H are in the word and in the correct positions 2, 3, 5 respectively from Guess 3 (C O U _ H).
3. T is not in the word (x in position 4 on Guess 3).
4. Eliminated letters to avoid: A, R, I, S, E, L, D, T.

So the current pattern is: C O U _ H
We need a 5-letter word starting with C, having O in 2nd, U in 3rd, H in 5th, and the 4th letter must be:
- Not any of the eliminated letters (A, R, I, S, E, L, D, T)
- Not any of the already confirmed letters in other positions (C, O, U, H)

Available letters for the 4th position (from remaining alphabet): B, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common English 5-letter words matching C O U _ H:
- COUGH - uses G (allowed)
- COUCH - uses C (already used in position 1, but C can appear elsewhere) but C is already in position 1 so might be valid
- COUGH seems more likely as G is a common letter

""COUGH"" fits perfectly:
- C (position 1) ✓
- O (position 2) ✓
- U (position 3) ✓
- G (position 4) - allowed (not in eliminated set)
- H (position 5) ✓
</think>

The pattern is now clearly **C O U _ H** with the fourth letter being any of the remaining allowed letters. The most common word fitting this pattern is ""COUGH"".
