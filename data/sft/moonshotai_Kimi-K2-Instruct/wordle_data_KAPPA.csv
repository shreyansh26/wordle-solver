### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that will maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words, and ideally includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

These letters cover a broad range of possibilities and should give good initial information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x), L(x), T(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word, but it is NOT in the 3rd position.

We now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

Our next guess should:
- Include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.
- Introduce several new, common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters that remain: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A strong next guess that incorporates A plus several new common letters, and avoids the eliminated ones, is “RADIO”.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.
2. Letter definitely IN the word and in the correct position: A in position 2.
   So the pattern looks like: _ A _ _ _
3. Remaining high-frequency letters (from the 26-letter alphabet, ignoring the 8 ruled out):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Of these, the more common ones are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

Goal: pick a valid 5-letter word that fits “_ A _ _ _”, uses only allowed letters, and introduces as many of the common remaining letters as possible to maximize information.

Candidates that fit _ A _ _ _:
- BACON, CABAL, CABIN, FANCY, HABIT, MACHO, PANSY, etc.

“BACON” uses B, C, N (all still possible) and keeps A fixed in position 2. It also contains O, but we know O is eliminated (from RADIO feedback). Therefore O is out.

“CABIN” uses C, B, I, N; but I is already eliminated.

“MACHY” is not a recognized word.

“HABIT” uses H, B, T; but T is eliminated.

“PANSY” uses P, N, S, Y; but S is eliminated.

“KAYAK” uses K, Y, K; it repeats K and is less informative.

“CANNY” uses C, N, N, Y; double N is okay, and all letters are still allowed.

“CANNY” seems the best among these – it is a valid word, fits _ A _ _ _, adds C, N, Y, and avoids every eliminated letter.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. Pattern is _ A _ _ _ (A is locked in position 2).
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, C, N, Y
3. Remaining still-possible letters (high-frequency ones in bold):
   B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word with second letter A, using only the allowed letters, and we’d like to pack in as many new common letters as possible.

Possible candidates:
- BAMBO → invalid (not a real word)
- GAMMA → uses G, M, but double-M is fine; contains M, G, A
- HAKKA → repeated K, but valid; uses H, K
- PAPAW → repeated P, uses P, W; valid
- VAMPS → uses V, M, P, S…but S is ruled out
- JAMMY → uses J, M, Y…but Y is ruled out
- KAPPA → uses K, P
- GAMMA, PAPAW, KAPPA seem best.

GAMMA introduces G and M; PAPAW introduces P and W; KAPPA introduces K and P.  
Among these, GAMMA gives us two entirely fresh, common letters (G, M) while respecting every constraint.

Hence, guess GAMMA.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,KAPPA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a word that will maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words, and ideally includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

These letters cover a broad range of possibilities and should give good initial information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x), L(x), T(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word, but it is NOT in the 3rd position.

We now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

Our next guess should:
- Include A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.
- Introduce several new, common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters that remain: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, Y, etc.

A strong next guess that incorporates A plus several new common letters, and avoids the eliminated ones, is “RADIO”.
- R, D, I, O are all high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O.
2. Letter definitely IN the word and in the correct position: A in position 2.
   So the pattern looks like: _ A _ _ _
3. Remaining high-frequency letters (from the 26-letter alphabet, ignoring the 8 ruled out):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Of these, the more common ones are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

Goal: pick a valid 5-letter word that fits “_ A _ _ _”, uses only allowed letters, and introduces as many of the common remaining letters as possible to maximize information.

Candidates that fit _ A _ _ _:
- BACON, CABAL, CABIN, FANCY, HABIT, MACHO, PANSY, etc.

“BACON” uses B, C, N (all still possible) and keeps A fixed in position 2. It also contains O, but we know O is eliminated (from RADIO feedback). Therefore O is out.

“CABIN” uses C, B, I, N; but I is already eliminated.

“MACHY” is not a recognized word.

“HABIT” uses H, B, T; but T is eliminated.

“PANSY” uses P, N, S, Y; but S is eliminated.

“KAYAK” uses K, Y, K; it repeats K and is less informative.

“CANNY” uses C, N, N, Y; double N is okay, and all letters are still allowed.

“CANNY” seems the best among these – it is a valid word, fits _ A _ _ _, adds C, N, Y, and avoids every eliminated letter.

Therefore I’ll go with CANNY.
