Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to make a strategic first guess that will give me the most useful information. I'll choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting correct letters. A good first guess should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three common vowels: A, O, E
- It has two very common consonants: R, S
- All letters are different
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

The first guess AROSE got all Xs, meaning none of those five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Consequently, we can immediately eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.
- Contains other common vowels (the remaining common ones are I and U) and common consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
- Has no repeated letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL” because:
- Letters used: U, N, T, I, L – none of which are in the eliminated set.
- It includes both remaining common vowels (U, I) and three common consonants.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are not in the word at all (x).
2. UNTIL → U and N are somewhere in the word but in the wrong positions (-), while T, I, L are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Must contain: U and N
- U and N must appear, but not in their guessed positions (U not first, N not second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses only letters not in the forbidden list,
- includes both U and N,
- puts U somewhere other than spot 1, and N somewhere other than spot 2.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and N.

To maximize information, we’ll try a word with U and N plus three other unused common consonants.  
A simple candidate: “UNHAP” looks possible, but P is allowed. However, H, A, P are allowed except A is already forbidden, so that won't work.  

Try “FUNNY” – but F is allowed, and N is allowed, but Y is allowed. However, it has double N, and we don't know if N can repeat. To avoid ambiguity, we’ll avoid repeats.

Try “MUNCH” – M, U, N, C, H: all letters are allowed, and the positions are compatible:
- U is not in position 1 (it’s in 2) – OK.
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 3) – OK.
- M, C, H are new letters that haven’t been tested.

Therefore, “MUNCH” is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

My goal is to make a strategic first guess that will give me the most useful information. I'll choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting correct letters. A good first guess should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three common vowels: A, O, E
- It has two very common consonants: R, S
- All letters are different
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess AROSE got all Xs, meaning none of those five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Consequently, we can immediately eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.
- Contains other common vowels (the remaining common ones are I and U) and common consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
- Has no repeated letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL” because:
- Letters used: U, N, T, I, L – none of which are in the eliminated set.
- It includes both remaining common vowels (U, I) and three common consonants.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are not in the word at all (x).
2. UNTIL → U and N are somewhere in the word but in the wrong positions (-), while T, I, L are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Must contain: U and N
- U and N must appear, but not in their guessed positions (U not first, N not second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses only letters not in the forbidden list,
- includes both U and N,
- puts U somewhere other than spot 1, and N somewhere other than spot 2.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and N.

To maximize information, we’ll try a word with U and N plus three other unused common consonants.  
A simple candidate: “UNHAP” looks possible, but P is allowed. However, H, A, P are allowed except A is already forbidden, so that won't work.  

Try “FUNNY” – but F is allowed, and N is allowed, but Y is allowed. However, it has double N, and we don't know if N can repeat. To avoid ambiguity, we’ll avoid repeats.

Try “MUNCH” – M, U, N, C, H: all letters are allowed, and the positions are compatible:
- U is not in position 1 (it’s in 2) – OK.
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 3) – OK.
- M, C, H are new letters that haven’t been tested.

Therefore, “MUNCH” is a valid next guess.

We need two more letters, both must come from the still-allowed set and must not duplicate any already-used letter.  
The remaining positions are 1 and 4.

Common 5-letter words that fit this exact pattern:
- D U N K Y  (K not yet tested)
- F U N K Y  (F not yet tested)
- J U N K Y  (J not yet tested)
- P U N K Y  (P not yet tested)
- V U N K Y  (V not yet tested)
- W U N K Y  (W not yet tested)
- Z U N K Y  (Z not yet tested)

All of these are valid English words, but we want a single guess that maximizes information.  
Choosing any of them is okay; I’ll pick the one most likely to be the actual word.

“DUNKY” is a recognized informal spelling of “donkey” in some dialects, and all its letters remain legal.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,funny,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to make a strategic first guess that will give me the most useful information. I'll choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting correct letters. A good first guess should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three common vowels: A, O, E
- It has two very common consonants: R, S
- All letters are different
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess AROSE got all Xs, meaning none of those five letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Consequently, we can immediately eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.
- Contains other common vowels (the remaining common ones are I and U) and common consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
- Has no repeated letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “UNTIL” because:
- Letters used: U, N, T, I, L – none of which are in the eliminated set.
- It includes both remaining common vowels (U, I) and three common consonants.
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are not in the word at all (x).
2. UNTIL → U and N are somewhere in the word but in the wrong positions (-), while T, I, L are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Must contain: U and N
- U and N must appear, but not in their guessed positions (U not first, N not second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses only letters not in the forbidden list,
- includes both U and N,
- puts U somewhere other than spot 1, and N somewhere other than spot 2.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and N.

To maximize information, we’ll try a word with U and N plus three other unused common consonants.  
A simple candidate: “UNHAP” looks possible, but P is allowed. However, H, A, P are allowed except A is already forbidden, so that won't work.  

Try “FUNNY” – but F is allowed, and N is allowed, but Y is allowed. However, it has double N, and we don't know if N can repeat. To avoid ambiguity, we’ll avoid repeats.

Try “MUNCH” – M, U, N, C, H: all letters are allowed, and the positions are compatible:
- U is not in position 1 (it’s in 2) – OK.
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 3) – OK.
- M, C, H are new letters that haven’t been tested.

Therefore, “MUNCH” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: MUNCH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, C, H
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: U, N
  – U is in position 2 (✓)
  – N is somewhere in the word but **not** position 3

Remaining legal letters (those never tested or ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word whose:
1. Second letter is U.
2. Contains N somewhere **other than** position 3.
3. Contains no letter from the forbidden set.
4. Uses only the remaining legal letters.

Candidate pattern:  _ U _ _ _  
With N allowed in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Possible consonant pool (D, F, G, B, K, P, V, W, Y, Z) and the vowel Y can serve as a vowel substitute.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words:
- DUMPY → contains M (forbidden)
- BUMPY → contains M (forbidden)
- GUNKY → has G, U, N, K, Y — M not used, C not used; letters G, U, N, K, Y are all still legal.  
  – Second letter U (✓)
  – N appears in position 3 (but N is **not allowed** in position 3, since earlier feedback said N(-) in UNTIL and N(✓) in MUNCH only confirms it’s somewhere, but the (-) in UNTIL ruled out position 2, and the (✓) in MUNCH rules out position 4, so position 3 only remains.)

Wait, this is tricky. We must reconcile:
- UNTIL: N in position 2 is wrong (N(-))
- MUNCH: N in position 3 is **not confirmed** (only U in 2 is ✓).  
But in MUNCH feedback is U(✓) N(✓) — that means N is in the word and is **exactly** in position 3.  
But earlier feedback says N(-) in UNTIL only meant not in position 2.  
So N is now known to be in position 3.

Thus pattern must be:  _ U N _ _

With the remaining letters: from B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible:
- B U N G Y → B, U, N, G, Y — all legal.
- F U N K Y → F, U, N, K, Y — all legal, but K and F.
- D U N G Y → D, U, N, G, Y — all legal.

All of these fit. Among them, “BUNGY” is a valid English word (a common spelling variant of “bungee”) and uses letters not yet eliminated.

Therefore, next logical guess is BUNGY.
