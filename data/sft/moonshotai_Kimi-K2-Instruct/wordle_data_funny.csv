For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the target word. A good strategy is to use words with high-frequency consonants and vowels. One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide valuable information about the letters in the secret word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has been shown to be effective statistically.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked x, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters. I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels that have not been used yet. Good remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, B, M, and remaining vowels include I, U. A strong starting mix would be a word like “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) or “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D).

From the feedback so far:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word (marked x): A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Letters that ARE in the word (marked -), but need to find their correct positions: U, N

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- DOES contain: U and N (somewhere, but not necessarily in the positions they were guessed)

My next guess should:
1. Include U and N somewhere.
2. Use only letters that have not been ruled out (not in the x set).
3. Try new letters to gain more information.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus U and N which we know are present).

A good strategy is to place U and N in new positions and surround them with other frequent unused consonants. Words like ""DUNKY"", ""FUNNY"", ""PUNCH"" might work, but need to check:

- DUNKY: uses D, U, N, K, Y. All letters not yet eliminated.
- PUNCH: uses P, U, N, C, H. All letters not yet eliminated.

Between these, ""DUNKY"" places U in position 2 and N in position 3, which are new positions compared to previous guesses. It also introduces D, K, Y as new test letters.

However, ""DUNKY"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""FUNNY"", but this repeats N which might not be optimal for information gain. ""PUNCH"" is common and introduces P, C, H. 

""PUNCH"" seems like a good balance of commonality and introducing new letters while including U and N. So I'll go with PUNCH, placing U in position 2 and N in position 3.

But wait, in ""UNTIL"", U was in position 1 (marked -), so it can't be in position 1. In ""PUNCH"" U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet for U. Similarly, N was in position 2 in ""UNTIL"" (marked -), so N can't be in position 2. In ""PUNCH"", N is in position 3, which is new.

Therefore, PUNCH is a valid guess under these constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the target word. A good strategy is to use words with high-frequency consonants and vowels. One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide valuable information about the letters in the secret word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has been shown to be effective statistically.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked x, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters. I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels that have not been used yet. Good remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, B, M, and remaining vowels include I, U. A strong starting mix would be a word like “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) or “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D). Between these, “UNTIL” covers the common consonants N, T, L and both remaining common vowels U, I while remaining a valid 5-letter word.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word (marked x): A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Letters that ARE in the word (marked -), but need to find their correct positions: U, N

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- DOES contain: U and N (somewhere, but not necessarily in the positions they were guessed)

My next guess should:
1. Include U and N somewhere.
2. Use only letters that have not been ruled out (not in the x set).
3. Try new letters to gain more information.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus U and N which we know are present).

A good strategy is to place U and N in new positions and surround them with other frequent unused consonants. Words like ""DUNKY"", ""FUNNY"", ""PUNCH"" might work, but need to check:

- DUNKY: uses D, U, N, K, Y. All letters not yet eliminated.
- PUNCH: uses P, U, N, C, H. All letters not yet eliminated.

Between these, ""DUNKY"" places U in position 2 and N in position 3, which are new positions compared to previous guesses. It also introduces D, K, Y as new test letters.

However, ""DUNKY"" might be too obscure. A more common word is ""FUNNY"", but this repeats N which might not be optimal for information gain. ""PUNCH"" is common and introduces P, C, H. 

""PUNCH"" seems like a good balance of commonality and introducing new letters while including U and N. So I'll go with PUNCH, placing U in position 2 and N in position 3.

But wait, in ""UNTIL"", U was in position 1 (marked -), so it can't be in position 1. In ""PUNCH"" U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet for U. Similarly, N was in position 2 in ""UNTIL"" (marked -), so N can't be in position 2. In ""PUNCH"", N is in position 3, which is new.

Therefore, PUNCH is a valid guess under these constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: _ U N _ _  (U at 2, N at 3)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, P, C, H, D, M
- Letters confirmed in word: U, N, Y (Y is at position 5)
- Remaining letters not yet tested: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

So the pattern is now: _ U N _ Y  
We need a letter for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining unused letters.

Looking at the remaining letters, common ones that would fit are:
- Position 1: B, F, G, K, V, W (these are common starting consonants)
- Position 4: B, F, G, K, V, W (same pool)

Good candidate words:
- BUNGY (archaic for ""bendy"" - valid in Scrabble)
- FUNKY
- GUNKY (valid variant spelling)
- VUNKY (not a word)
- WUNKY (not a word)

Among these, ""FUNKY"" is the most common English word that fits the pattern _ U N _ Y with all letters not yet eliminated.

Let's verify:
- F: not used before
- U: confirmed at 2
- N: confirmed at 3
- K: not used before
- Y: confirmed at 5

A good strategy is to use words with high-frequency consonants and vowels. One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can provide valuable information about the letters in the secret word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons.

I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels that have not been used yet. Good remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, B, M, and remaining vowels include I, U. A strong starting mix would be a word like “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) or “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D).

Words like ""DUNKY"", ""FUNNY"", ""PUNCH"" might work, but need to check:\n\n- DUNKY: uses D, U, N, K, Y. All letters not yet eliminated.\n- PUNCH: uses P, U, N, C, H.

""PUNCH"" is common and introduces P, C, H. \n\n""PUNCH"" seems like a good balance of commonality and introducing new letters while including U and N.
