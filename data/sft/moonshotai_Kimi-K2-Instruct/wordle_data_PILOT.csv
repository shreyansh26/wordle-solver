For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. The key is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
This combination should give me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all **not in the word** (x).
- O is in the word but **not in position 3** (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains O, but O is not the third letter.
2. The word does **not** contain A, R, S, E.

Letters to avoid next: A, R, S, E.  
We must use O, but not in position 3.

New candidate must be five letters, valid word, no A/R/S/E, must include O.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since we already have O, and A/E are out).

I need a word with:
- O somewhere except position 3.
- Other letters from the remaining pool.

Possible words:
- MOUTH (O is second, but uses T, H which are untested)
- DOING (but has I, G, N - O is second)
- COULD (O is second, uses U, L, D - but C is untested)
- POINT (O is second, uses P, I, N, T)

""POINT"" uses:
- O (confirmed in word, not third)
- P, I, N, T which are all new letters and common.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, N
