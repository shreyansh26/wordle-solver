Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Uses a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess would use several of these. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 5 very common letters (3 vowels and 2 common consonants). Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers different common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- S and T are **not in the word** at all (marked x).
- L, A, E are **in the word** but in the wrong positions.
- The word must contain L, A, E somewhere.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

Because A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we need placements for A and E that avoid those spots.
Also, L is in the word but not in position 2.

A reasonable next step is to try a word that:
- Keeps the known letters A, L, E.
- Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (R, O, N, I, etc.).
- Re-uses none of the eliminated letters S or T.

One good candidate is “REALM”:
- Uses R (new), E (known), A (known), L (known), M (new).
- E is now in position 2 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden by feedback), so this is invalid (A can’t be in 3).

Another candidate is “EARLY”:
- E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R (new), L in 4 (allowed), Y (new).
- This respects all constraints: avoids S/T, keeps A/E/L, and places A and E in new positions.

- F (new), L in 2 (forbidden), A fixed, M (new), E in 5 (forbidden)

Next: “GLANE”
- Same issues.

Let’s try “PLANE” again but adjust for E. Position 5 is impossible. So E needs to be in 3 or 4.

Try “PLANE” → E is 5 (invalid)

Try “PALED”
- P (new), A fixed in 2, L in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), D (new)  
- Gives pattern _ A _ _ _ with L and E placed correctly  
- No repeats, no forbidden letters, and tests new letters P and D.

Looks good.

  – Position 4 = E (✓ in PALED)
- Letters in the word but still “floating” (wrong position):

L must appear in positions 1, 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
We also have no information yet on positions 1, 3, 5 except:

Let’s try to place L in the only unchecked spots.  
If L is at 1: L A _ E _  
If L is at 3: _ A L E _  
If L is at 5: _ A _ E L  

Let’s test the third option (L at 5) because it gives a nice ending and still leaves two fresh slots for new common letters.

Candidate: _ A _ E L

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess would use several of these. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 5 very common letters (3 vowels and 2 common consonants). Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers different common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S and T are **not in the word** at all (marked x).
- L, A, E are **in the word** but in the wrong positions.
- The word must contain L, A, E somewhere.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

Because A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we need placements for A and E that avoid those spots.
Also, L is in the word but not in position 2.

A reasonable next step is to try a word that:
- Keeps the known letters A, L, E.
- Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (R, O, N, I, etc.).
- Re-uses none of the eliminated letters S or T.

One good candidate is “REALM”:
- Uses R (new), E (known), A (known), L (known), M (new).
- E is now in position 2 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden by feedback), so this is invalid (A can’t be in 3).

Another candidate is “EARLY”:
- E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R (new), L in 4 (allowed), Y (new).
- This respects all constraints: avoids S/T, keeps A/E/L, and places A and E in new positions.

So I’ll go with EARLY.

Let’s build a candidate that:
- Places L in position 3 or 5  
- Places E in position 3 or 4  
- Introduces two new common consonants

A good choice: “PLANE”
- P (new), L in 3 (allowed), A fixed in 2, N (new), E in 5 (forbidden) → invalid

Next: “LEANS”

4. Letters still floating (in word, position unknown) – none left; we now have A, E, L placed and no other letters flagged “-”.  
   Therefore, only the first and third positions remain open.

5. Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: common consonants not yet ruled out.  
   From the alphabet, discard S T R Y D C B.  
   Remaining high-frequency consonants: N, G, M, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

We want a 5-letter word fitting #A#EL where the two blanks come only from the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- NAGEL – but G is allowed, yet N A G E L is a valid dictionary word.  
- M A G E L – gives MAGEL (not in some dictionaries).  
- N A M E L – not real.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,lapel,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Uses a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess would use several of these. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 5 very common letters (3 vowels and 2 common consonants). Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers different common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S and T are **not in the word** at all (marked x).
- L, A, E are **in the word** but in the wrong positions.
- The word must contain L, A, E somewhere.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

Because A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we need placements for A and E that avoid those spots.
Also, L is in the word but not in position 2.

A reasonable next step is to try a word that:
- Keeps the known letters A, L, E.
- Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (R, O, N, I, etc.).
- Re-uses none of the eliminated letters S or T.

One good candidate is “REALM”:
- Uses R (new), E (known), A (known), L (known), M (new).
- E is now in position 2 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden by feedback), so this is invalid (A can’t be in 3).

Another candidate is “EARLY”:
- E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R (new), L in 4 (allowed), Y (new).
- This respects all constraints: avoids S/T, keeps A/E/L, and places A and E in new positions.

So I’ll go with EARLY.

<guess>EARLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(x) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y  
2. Letters confirmed IN the word (so far):  
   - A is fixed in position 2  
   - L is in the word but not positions 2, 4  
   - E is in the word but not positions 1, 5  
3. Still-unknown positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (only position 2 is locked as “A”)

Currently known pattern: _ A _ _ _

Needed:  
- L somewhere other than positions 2 or 4  
- E somewhere other than positions 1 or 5  

To maximize information, we want fresh common letters that haven’t been tried. Good candidates among unused common letters: N, I, C, D, O, U, G, M.

Let’s build a candidate that:
- Places L in position 3 or 5  
- Places E in position 3 or 4  
- Introduces two new common consonants

A good choice: “PLANE”
- P (new), L in 3 (allowed), A fixed in 2, N (new), E in 5 (forbidden) → invalid

Next: “LEANS”
- L in 1 (allowed), E in 2 (forbidden by position), A in 3 (allowed), N, S (eliminated)

Next: “CLANE”
- C (new), L in 2 (forbidden), A fixed, N, E in 5 (forbidden)

Next: “GLADE”
- G (new), L in 2 (forbidden), A fixed, D (new), E in 5 (forbidden)

Next: “ALONE”
- A fixed in 2, L in 3 (allowed), O (new), N (new), E in 5 (forbidden)

Next: “FLAME”
- F (new), L in 2 (forbidden), A fixed, M (new), E in 5 (forbidden)

Next: “GLANE”
- Same issues.

Let’s try “PLANE” again but adjust for E. Position 5 is impossible. So E needs to be in 3 or 4.

Try “PLANE” → E is 5 (invalid)

Try “PALED”
- P (new), A fixed in 2, L in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), D (new)  
- Gives pattern _ A _ _ _ with L and E placed correctly  
- No repeats, no forbidden letters, and tests new letters P and D.

Looks good.

Known facts:
- The word is 5 letters.
- Positions:
  – Position 2 = A (✓ in both EARLY and PALED)
  – Position 4 = E (✓ in PALED)
- Letters in the word but still “floating” (wrong position):
  – L (from SLATE, EARLY, PALED)
  – E was floating before, but now locked at 4.
- Letters NOT in the word (x): S, T, R, Y, D
- Letters still unused but common: N, I, G, O, U, C, M, B, F, H, K, etc.

Current pattern:
_ A _ E _

L must appear in positions 1, 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
We also have no information yet on positions 1, 3, 5 except:
- They cannot be S, T, R, Y, D
- One of them must be L
- No info on the other two.

Let’s try to place L in the only unchecked spots.  
If L is at 1: L A _ E _  
If L is at 3: _ A L E _  
If L is at 5: _ A _ E L  

Let’s test the third option (L at 5) because it gives a nice ending and still leaves two fresh slots for new common letters.

Candidate: _ A _ E L  
Need 2 new consonants for positions 1 and 3.  
Among high-frequency unused letters: N, G, C, M, B, F, H, K, I (but we want consonants).

Try “CABLE”
- C (new), A (✓), B (new), E (✓), L (floating but now at 5 – allowed)
- Uses C and B, neither excluded.
- Pattern: C A B E L → fits _ A _ E L.

Let’s verify:
- No S, T, R, Y, D
- A at 2 and E at 4 are fixed
- L at 5 – allowed (never tested in 5 before)
- C and B are new.

Looks good.

Consolidating the information after five guesses:

1. Fixed letters and positions:
   - Position 2 = A
   - Position 4 = E
   - Position 5 = L

2. Current pattern: _ A _ E L

3. Letters **confirmed NOT present** in the word at all:
   S, T, R, Y, D, C, B, N, G

4. Remaining positions to fill: positions 1 and 3
   Allowed letters (common consonants not yet excluded):
   F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word matching
   ?  A  ?  E  L
   where the two question marks use only letters not in the banned list.

6. Quick dictionary scan:
   F A M E L → ""FAMEL"" is not a recognized English word.
   H A M E L → ""HAMEL"" is a surname, but not common.
   M A M E L → invalid.
   K A M E L → invalid.
   V A M E L → invalid.
   W A M E L → invalid.
   F A V E L → ""FAVEL"" is a surname (rare).

   The only common dictionary word that fits is: M A N E L → ""MANEL"" is not valid.
   But ""H A M E L"" is sometimes found.

   However, both ""FAMEL"" and ""HAMEL"" are questionable. The only truly common English word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is:

   F A K E L → ""FAKEL"" is not valid.
   Wait, ""F A M E L"" is not valid, but ""F A K E L"" isn't either.

   Actually, the most common valid English word that fits _ A _ E L with allowed letters is:

   F A C E L → but C is banned.
   
   Let me re-examine. The allowed consonants now are F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

   Doing a quick scan: ""MAPLE"" is valid, but P is banned.
   ""HABLE"" is not a word.
   ""MAFEL"" is not a word.
   ""KAVEL"" is not a word.
   ""FABLE"" is valid, but B is banned.
   ""MAVEN"" is not matching the pattern.

   The only valid, common English word that fits is:

   M A K E L → ""MAKEL"" is not valid.
   However, ""FABLE"" has B banned, ""MAPLE"" has P banned.

   It appears the only remaining possibility among common words is:

   M A K E L → invalid.

   This is troubling. Let me do a more careful dictionary search.

   The pattern is _ A _ E L
   Letters available: F, H, K, M, P (but P is from PALED's P(-), so P is allowed as it was only marked - meaning in word but wrong place. However, P was in PALED as P(-), which means P is in the word but not in position 1. So P is still possible.

   Reviewing P: PALED gave P(-), meaning P is in the word but not in position 1.

   So P is in the word, and must be in position 3 (since positions 1,2,4,5 are taken by _ A _ E L).

   So position 3 must be P.

   Therefore the word must be: _ A P E L

   Position 1: must be a consonant from remaining allowed letters: F, H, K, M, V, W.

   Checking:
   F A P E L → ""FAP EL"" → invalid.
   H A P E L → ""HAP EL"" → invalid.
   K A P E L → ""K A P E L"" → ""KAPEL"" is not valid.
   M A P E L → ""MAPLE"" → valid 5-letter word!

   ""MAPLE"" fits:
   - Pattern: M A P E L
   - Uses only allowed letters (M is not banned)
   - P is in position 3 (allowed, since P(-) in PALED meant P is in word but not position 1)
   - All other constraints satisfied.

   Therefore, the next logical guess is ""MAPLE"".
