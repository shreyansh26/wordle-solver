For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Many 5-letter word games use a strategy of picking words with common vowels and consonants. A popular starting choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. Another good option is ""AROSE"" which has A, R, O, S, E. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it gives me good coverage of common consonants and vowels, and is a strong opening move in word-guessing games.

So every letter in SLATE – S, L, A, T, E – is “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates an entire set of common letters.  
To maximize new information in the next guess, I should now choose a word made solely from letters that have not been ruled out yet, and that still contains a good spread of high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Possible consonants still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Possible vowels still in play: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word using common untouched letters is “ROUND”:

From the latest feedback we know:

Confirmed positions:
- U is in position 1 (✓)
- N is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)
- P is in position 5 (✓)

The only letter left to determine is the third one (position 3).  
Allowed letters not yet eliminated: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the consonants most likely to appear in everyday five-letter words are B, C, G, K, M, V.  
Scanning the pattern U N _ I P, the word “UNBIP” isn’t valid in English, “UNCIP” isn’t either, but “UNZIP” is a real word and Z hasn’t been ruled out.  
Another plausible candidate is “UNHIP”, but H is already ruled out.  

The only common word fitting is UNZIP.

Therefore, the next logical guess is UNZIP.
