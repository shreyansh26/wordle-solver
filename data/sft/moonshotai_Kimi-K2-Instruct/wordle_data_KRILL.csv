For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has:
1. Common consonants and vowels to get maximum information
2. No repeated letters to test more unique letters
3. Good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or STARE. 

I'll go with CRANE because:
- C is very common
- R is common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is very common

Current known facts:

Remaining consonants that are still possible:
B, D, H, L, P, V, W

Remaining vowels:
U (only vowel left since A, E, I, O are ruled out or placed)

So positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled from B, D, H, L, P, V, W, U with at least one vowel (U) somewhere in 4 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U could be in 4: _ R I U _
- U could be in 5: _ R I _ U

- D R I U _ – nothing common
- B R I _ U – BRIBU? No.
- D R I _ U – DRIBU? No.
- P R I _ U – PRIBU? No.

""PRILL"" – two Ls is okay, E out
""DRILL"" – L okay, but no U
""BRILL"" – L okay, but no U

But we know the word must contain U (since it's the only remaining vowel), so words must have U in 1,4, or 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has:
1. Common consonants and vowels to get maximum information
2. No repeated letters to test more unique letters
3. Good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or STARE. 

I'll go with CRANE because:
- C is very common
- R is common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is very common

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From feedback CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x):

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Letters to avoid: C, A, N, E  
Letters we know must be somewhere: R (already fixed in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and none of C, A, N, E.  
Good consonants to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Possible candidates:  
- T R I C K → but C is excluded  
- B R I D E → but E is excluded  
- T R I B E → E excluded  
- P R O U D → has O and U  
- D R O O M → O twice, but we don't know about repeats yet  
- F R O S T → good consonants S and T, vowel O  
- G R I P S → consonants G, P, S; vowel I

I'll pick FROST because:
- R is in correct position
- F, S, T are new, common consonants
- O is a new vowel
- No excluded letters

Remaining consonants (high frequency): B, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U

We still need to test positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
Let’s look for a word that:

- starts with a consonant not yet tried (B, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y)  
- uses R in slot 2  
- fills the remaining slots with I or U plus consonants that haven’t been rejected yet.

Good candidate: “BRIDE” – but E is ruled out.  
Next: “DRUID” – has two Us; might be okay.  
Another: “PRIME” – E is out.  
“GRIMY” – G, R, I, M, Y. All letters are still allowed and it gives three new consonants plus one new vowel.

Let’s go with GRIMY.

U (only vowel left since A, E, I, O are ruled out or placed)

So positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled from B, D, H, L, P, V, W, U with at least one vowel (U) somewhere in 4 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U could be in 4: _ R I U _

From the four guesses we have the following confirmed information:

Pattern constraints (✓):
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = I  

Letters ruled out entirely (×):
C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T, G, M, Y, D, U

Letters still allowed (not yet placed):
B, H, L, P, V, W

The only vowels left are none—U was the last remaining vowel and has now been ruled out.  
Therefore the unknown positions (1, 4, 5) must all be consonants from {B, H, L, P, V, W}.

So the word shape is: [B/H/L/P/V/W] R I [B/H/L/P/V/W] [B/H/L/P/V/W]

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- starts with one of B/H/L/P/V/W,
- has R in 2, I in 3,
- ends with two more distinct consonants from the same set,
- contains no repeats of letters we’ve already ruled out.

Scanning common 5-letter words:

- B R I B E – E ruled out  
- B R I D E – D ruled out  
- B R I N G – N, G ruled out  
- B R I C K – C, K (K never tested) – C already out  
- B R I S K – S, K – S already out

Looking more carefully:

- B R I B E (invalid)  
- P R I B E (invalid)  
- B R I V E (invalid)  
- V R I B E (invalid)  

Let me list possible valid words using allowed letters:

Allowed consonants: B, H, L, P, V, W

Common 5-letter words with R I in positions 2-3 and remaining letters from allowed set:

- P R I _ _  
  – PRIM_ – M out  
- B R I _ _  
  – BRISK – S, K – S out  
  – BRIG_ – G out  
- V R I _ _  
  – nothing standard  
- W R I _ _  
  – WRICK – C, K – C out  

Actually, the only common word left that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **PRIVY**:
- P: allowed  
- R: correct position  
- I: correct position  
- V: allowed  
- Y: ruled out (from GRIMY)  

Oops, Y is out. Next option:

- **PRIVY** – Y out  
- **BRISK** – S, K – S out  
- **BRIGS** – G, S – both out  

Let me check every single combination systematically:

We need to choose two different consonants from {B, H, L, P, V, W} for positions 4 and 5, plus one for position 1, ensuring the total set forms a valid word.

Valid words fitting _ R I _ _ with letters from {B, H, L, P, V, W}:

- L R I V E – E out  
- W R I V E – E out  
- P R I B E – E out  

Hmm, every _ R I _ _ word I can think of ends in E or uses a letter that’s already ruled out. Let me check if any word uses only the remaining consonants and has no other vowels:

- B R I P P – “BRIPP” – not real  
- B R I V V – not real  
- P R I B B – not real  
- V R I P P – not real  
- P R I L L – “PRILL” – this is actually a valid word meaning to grind coarsely.  
  – P, R, I, L, L – L not yet ruled out, and no disallowed letters.  

“PRILL” fits:
- P: allowed  
- R: correct position  
- I: correct position  
- L: allowed  
- L: allowed (repetition okay since we haven’t ruled out doubles)  

No letters from the banned set are used. Let me verify:

Letters in PRILL: P, R, I, L, L  
Banned letters: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T, G, M, Y, D, U  
None of these appear in PRILL.

Therefore, the next logical guess is **PRILL**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Common consonants and vowels to get maximum information
2. No repeated letters to test more unique letters
3. Good coverage of frequent letters in English 5-letter words

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or STARE. 

I'll go with CRANE because:
- C is very common
- R is common
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is very common

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From feedback CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x):

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

Letters to avoid: C, A, N, E  
Letters we know must be somewhere: R (already fixed in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and none of C, A, N, E.  
Good consonants to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Possible candidates:  
- T R I C K → but C is excluded  
- B R I D E → but E is excluded  
- T R I B E → E excluded  
- P R O U D → has O and U  
- D R O O M → O twice, but we don't know about repeats yet  
- F R O S T → good consonants S and T, vowel O  
- G R I P S → consonants G, P, S; vowel I

I'll pick FROST because:
- R is in correct position
- F, S, T are new, common consonants
- O is a new vowel
- No excluded letters

2. Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T

Remaining consonants (high frequency): B, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U

We still need to test positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
Let’s look for a word that:

- starts with a consonant not yet tried (B, D, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y)  
- uses R in slot 2  
- fills the remaining slots with I or U plus consonants that haven’t been rejected yet.

Good candidate: “BRIDE” – but E is ruled out.  
Next: “DRUID” – has two Us; might be okay.  
Another: “PRIME” – E is out.  
“GRIMY” – G, R, I, M, Y. All letters are still allowed and it gives three new consonants plus one new vowel.

Let’s go with GRIMY.

Remaining consonants that are still possible:
B, D, H, L, P, V, W

Remaining vowels:
U (only vowel left since A, E, I, O are ruled out or placed)

So positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled from B, D, H, L, P, V, W, U with at least one vowel (U) somewhere in 4 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- U could be in 4: _ R I U _
- U could be in 5: _ R I _ U

- B R I D U – not a word
- P R I D U – not a word
- D R I U _ – nothing common
- B R I _ U – BRIBU? No.
- D R I _ U – DRIBU? No.
- P R I _ U – PRIBU? No.
- H R I _ U – No.

Let me list valid English words that fit _ R I _ _ and only use allowed letters:
- DRILL – but L and L are allowed? Wait, L hasn't been ruled out, but we have two Ls. We don't know about repeats yet.
- PRIUS – but S is ruled out.

- D R I V E – E out
- P R I U _ – no
- D R I V E – E out
- D R I V E – E out

I think I missed checking BRUVI? No. Let me systematically:

Positions: 1,4,5 can be from {B,D,H,L,P,V,W,U} with at least one U.

Possible patterns:
- _ R I _ U: words ending in U are rare. One possible is ""BRIJU"" (but not valid), ""DRIJU"" (no)
- _ R I U _: words like ""BRIUS"" (S out), ""DRIUS"" (no), ""PRIUS"" (S out)
- _ R I _ _ with U in 4 or 5, but no valid words.

Wait, let me check ""BRIEF"" – E and F out.
""PRILL"" – two Ls is okay, E out
""DRILL"" – L okay, but no U
""BRILL"" – L okay, but no U

But we know the word must contain U (since it's the only remaining vowel), so words must have U in 1,4, or 5.

Looking again, the only valid English word I can find is:
""DRUID"" – D, R, I, U, D
But D is allowed, U is allowed. Let me check:
- D in 1: allowed
- R in 2: ✓
- I in 3: ✓
- U in 4: allowed
- D in 5: allowed

""DRUID"" fits all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the four guesses we have the following confirmed information:

Pattern constraints (✓):
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = I  

Letters ruled out entirely (×):
C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T, G, M, Y, D, U

Letters still allowed (not yet placed):
B, H, L, P, V, W

The only vowels left are none—U was the last remaining vowel and has now been ruled out.  
Therefore the unknown positions (1, 4, 5) must all be consonants from {B, H, L, P, V, W}.

So the word shape is: [B/H/L/P/V/W] R I [B/H/L/P/V/W] [B/H/L/P/V/W]

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- starts with one of B/H/L/P/V/W,
- has R in 2, I in 3,
- ends with two more distinct consonants from the same set,
- contains no repeats of letters we’ve already ruled out.

Scanning common 5-letter words:

- B R I B E – E ruled out  
- B R I D E – D ruled out  
- B R I N G – N, G ruled out  
- B R I C K – C, K (K never tested) – C already out  
- B R I S K – S, K – S already out  
- B R I V O – O ruled out  
- P R I C K – C, K – C out  
- P R I M E – M, E out  
- V R I _ _ – no common words  
- H R I _ _ – nothing common  
- W R I _ _ – “WRICK” has C, “WRIST” has S, “WRITE” has T, E  
- L R I _ _ – nothing common  

Looking more carefully:

- B R I B E (invalid)  
- P R I B E (invalid)  
- B R I V E (invalid)  
- V R I B E (invalid)  

Let me list possible valid words using allowed letters:

Allowed consonants: B, H, L, P, V, W

Common 5-letter words with R I in positions 2-3 and remaining letters from allowed set:

- P R I _ _  
  – PRIM_ – M out  
- B R I _ _  
  – BRISK – S, K – S out  
  – BRIG_ – G out  
- V R I _ _  
  – nothing standard  
- W R I _ _  
  – WRICK – C, K – C out  

Actually, the only common word left that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **PRIVY**:
- P: allowed  
- R: correct position  
- I: correct position  
- V: allowed  
- Y: ruled out (from GRIMY)  

Oops, Y is out. Next option:

- **PRIVY** – Y out  
- **BRISK** – S, K – S out  
- **BRIGS** – G, S – both out  

Let me check every single combination systematically:

We need to choose two different consonants from {B, H, L, P, V, W} for positions 4 and 5, plus one for position 1, ensuring the total set forms a valid word.

Valid words fitting _ R I _ _ with letters from {B, H, L, P, V, W}:

- B R I V E – E out  
- B R I V Y – Y out  
- P R I V Y – Y out  
- B R I B E – E out  
- V R I B E – E out  
- H R I V E – E out  
- L R I V E – E out  
- W R I V E – E out  
- P R I B E – E out  

Hmm, every _ R I _ _ word I can think of ends in E or uses a letter that’s already ruled out. Let me check if any word uses only the remaining consonants and has no other vowels:

- B R I P P – “BRIPP” – not real  
- B R I V V – not real  
- P R I B B – not real  
- V R I P P – not real  
- P R I L L – “PRILL” – this is actually a valid word meaning to grind coarsely.  
  – P, R, I, L, L – L not yet ruled out, and no disallowed letters.  

“PRILL” fits:
- P: allowed  
- R: correct position  
- I: correct position  
- L: allowed  
- L: allowed (repetition okay since we haven’t ruled out doubles)  

No letters from the banned set are used. Let me verify:

Letters in PRILL: P, R, I, L, L  
Banned letters: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, T, G, M, Y, D, U  
None of these appear in PRILL.

Therefore, the next logical guess is **PRILL**.
