### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters that appear frequently in English words. Letters like S, T, R, A, E, I, O, and N are very common in 5-letter words. 

After considering several options like ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that are likely to appear in many English words, and it doesn't repeat any letters, which helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but at the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 1).
- A, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- I is in the word and in the correct position 3.

So far I know:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ _
- Letters to include: R (somewhere other than pos 1), I
- Letters to exclude: A, S, E

Good next candidates would use common consonants and keep I fixed in position 3. Words like:
- TRICK (but S is out, so no S, E, A)
- DRILL (but L is allowed)
- BRISK (but S is out)
- GRIND (but N is allowed)

After checking, TRICK avoids A, S, E and repositions R away from position 1. Also uses common letters T and K to gather more info.

Let’s try TRICK.

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
   – R is in the word but not in position 1.
   – I is correct in position 3.
   – A, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRICK → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(-)
   – R is now in the correct position (position 2).
   – I is still correct in position 3.
   – K is in the word but not in position 5.
   – T and C are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: ? R I ? ?
- Allowed letters so far: R (fixed in pos 2), I (fixed in pos 3), K (somewhere other than pos 5), and possibly others we haven't tested yet.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, T, C.

We still need:
- Positions 1, 4, 5.
- K must appear in one of 1, 4 (not 5).
- R is fixed at 2, I at 3.

Good candidates that meet these rules:
- BRIKE (but E is forbidden)
- FRIKI (but may not be a valid English word)
- GRIND (D is allowed, but N is allowed, but K is required)
- PRICK (C is forbidden)
- BRINK (B, N allowed; K is allowed and fits in pos 5, but K cannot be in pos 5)

Actually, K must be in pos 1 or 4.

So:
- K R I _ _ (K in pos 1)
- _ R I K _ (K in pos 4)

Looking at valid 5-letter English words:
- KRILL (L is allowed)
- BRISK (S is forbidden)
- GRIMY (no K)
- KRIMP (P is allowed)
- PRIKM (invalid)

KRILL fits all constraints:
- K is in pos 1 (allowed).
- R in pos 2 (fixed).
- I in pos 3 (fixed).
