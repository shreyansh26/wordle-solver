For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Popular starting words include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I’ll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should give a strong foundation for narrowing down the secret word based on the feedback.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A and S are ruled out.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
   - R is still not in position 1 (but known to be elsewhere).
   - O is now fixed in position 2 (✓).
   - U and T are ruled out.
   - E is still somewhere except positions 5 and 4 (from AROSE and ROUTE respectively).

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain: R somewhere in positions 3,4,5 (since 1 and 2 are excluded for R).
- Must also contain E somewhere in positions 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is taken by O), so positions 1,3,4.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, S, U, T.
- Letters still untested that are common: D, L, N, C, H, P, G, M, etc.

Possible skeletons:
O is locked at position 2.
R must appear in positions 3,4,5.
E must appear in positions 1,3,4, but must avoid conflicting with R, and must also avoid position 5.

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
- _ O _ _ _
- R in position 4 or 5
- E in position 1 or 3
- Choose common remaining consonants.

Candidate: “CORER” – but repeats R and has E at 5 (forbidden).
Candidate: “HORDE” – E at 5 (forbidden), T already ruled out (HORDE has T? No, H O R D E – OK, but E at 5 is forbidden).
Candidate: “GORED” – D is OK, E at 5 is forbidden.
Candidate: “PORER” – P and R in 4, E at 5 forbidden.
Candidate: “BORED” – B is OK, E at 5 forbidden.

Let’s try “HORDE” – but E is at 5 (forbidden).
Try “ROGER” – R at 1 (forbidden from first feedback).
Try “CORER” – R repeats and E at 5.

Better: Choose a word with E in position 1 or 3 and R in 3,4,5.

Pattern _ O _ _ _:
- E in position 1: E O _ _ _
- E in position 3: _ O E _ _

Let’s try “HORSE” – S already ruled out.
“HONEY” – N,Y are new letters, but E at 4 is allowed.
“HONEY” also has O in 2 (OK), E in 4 (OK), N in 3, Y in 5, H in 1.
Letters used so far: H, O, N, E, Y – none ruled out except S, A, U, T, so all are possible.

- Position 1: H – untested

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, S not in word.
   - R is in word, not in pos 2.
   - O is in word, not in pos 3.
   - E is in word, not in pos 5.

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
   - O is locked in pos 2 (✓).
   - R is in word, not in pos 1.
   - E is in word, not in pos 4 (since 5 was already ruled out from AROSE).

3. HONEY → H(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) Y(x)
   - H is locked in pos 1 (✓).
   - O is still locked in pos 2 (✓).
   - E is locked in pos 4 (✓).
   - N and Y are not in the word.

So the pattern is: H O _ E _
Letters known to be in the word: R (not in pos 1 or 2).
Letters not in the word: A, S, U, T, N, Y.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1,2 excluded, 4 is taken by E).

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out.
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

If R is in pos 3: H O R E _
   Then pos 5 must be one of the remaining consonants, e.g. B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
   Common valid words: HORSE (but S is ruled out), HORDE (but D is allowed).

If R is in pos 5: H O _ E R
   Then pos 3 must be a consonant not yet used, e.g. B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
   Common valid words: HOMER (but M is untested), HOPER (P), etc.

Let's check HORDE:
- H O R D E
- Letters: H(✓), O(✓), R(position 3), E(✓), D(new).
- R is not in pos 1 or 2 (OK), and not in pos 4 or 5 (OK).
- All letters are allowed (D is not ruled out).

Check HOMER:
- H O M E R
- M is untested, R is in pos 5 (allowed).
- This is also valid.

Between HORDE and HOMER, both fit. But let's see which gives more info or is more common. HORDE is a valid word.

However, we need to confirm R's position is still flexible. Since R is known to be in word but not in pos 1,2,4,5 (wait, no: R is not in pos 1 (from ROUTE), not in 2 (from AROSE), and not in 4 or 5 (no, only E is fixed in 4, and 5 is open for R).

Wait, let's clarify R's possible positions:
From AROSE: R not in pos 2.
From ROUTE: R not in pos 1.
From HONEY: R not mentioned, so no additional restriction.
Thus R can be in pos 3,4,5. But E is in pos 4, so R can be in pos 3 or 5.

Thus possible words:
H O R E _ (but then pos 5 must be filled, and we have H O R E ?)
H O _ E R

HORDE is H O R D E, but this has E in pos 5 which is ruled out (from AROSE).
So HORDE is invalid because E is in pos 5.

Thus the only valid pattern is H O _ E R, with R in pos 5.
Then pos 3 must be a consonant not yet used (not A,S,U,T,N,Y).

Common choices: B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
Let's pick a common consonant like M, giving HOMER.

Check HOMER:
H(✓) O(✓) M(?) E(✓) R(?)
M is untested, R is allowed in pos 5 (since only ruled out from pos 1,2).
This seems the best fit.

Therefore, the next guess is HOMER.

   - H is locked in pos 1 (✓).

So the pattern is: H O _ E _
Letters known to be in the word: R (not in pos 1 or 2).
Letters not in the word: A, S, U, T, N, Y.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1,2 excluded, 4 is taken by E).

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out.
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

If R is in pos 3: H O R E _
   Then pos 5 must be one of the remaining consonants, e.g. B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
   Common valid words: HORSE (but S is ruled out), HORDE (but D is allowed).

If R is in pos 5: H O _ E R
   Then pos 3 must be a consonant not yet used, e.g. B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
   Common valid words: HOMER (but M is untested), HOPER (P), etc.

Let's check HORDE:
- H O R D E
- Letters: H(✓), O(✓), R(position 3), E(✓), D(new).
- R is not in pos 1 or 2 (OK), and not in pos 4 or 5 (OK).
- All letters are allowed (D is not ruled out).

Check HOMER:
- H O M E R
- M is untested, R is in pos 5 (allowed).
- This is also valid.

Between HORDE and HOMER, both fit. But let's see which gives more info or is more common. HORDE is a valid word.

From AROSE: R not in pos 2.
From ROUTE: R not in pos 1.

Thus possible words:
H O R E _ (but then pos 5 must be filled, and we have H O R E ?)
H O _ E R

HORDE is H O R D E, but this has E in pos 5 which is ruled out (from AROSE).
So HORDE is invalid because E is in pos 5.

Thus the only valid pattern is H O _ E R, with R in pos 5.
Then pos 3 must be a consonant not yet used (not A,S,U,T,N,Y).

Common choices: B,C,D,F,G,L,M,P,V,W.
Let's pick a common consonant like M, giving HOMER.

Check HOMER:
H(✓) O(✓) M(?) E(✓) R(?)
M is untested, R is allowed in pos 5 (since only ruled out from pos 1,2).
This seems the best fit.

Therefore, the next guess is HOMER.",Guess 4: HOMER -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) M(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
