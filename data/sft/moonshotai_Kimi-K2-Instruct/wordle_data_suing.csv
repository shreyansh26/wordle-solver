### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to pick a word that uses common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate as it uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- DOES contain S (but not in position 4).

A good second guess should use S in a different position and introduce several other high-frequency unused letters. The word ""STUNT"" uses S (now in position 1), plus T, U, N - all common and untested.

From all feedback so far:

1. A, R, O, E, T, P, K are NOT in the word.
2. Letters known to be in the word:  
   - S – must be in first position (✓ in both STUNT and SPUNK).  
   - N – must be in fourth position (✓ in both STUNT and SPUNK).  
3. Letter U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
   In STUNT it was in position 3, in SPUNK it was in position 3 again ⇒ U cannot be in position 3.  
   Therefore U must be in position 2 or 5.

Current word skeleton:  
S _ _ N _ or S _ _ N _ with U possibly in position 2 or 5.

Unused common letters: I, L, D, Y, C, B, F, H, G, M, W, V, etc.

Try U in position 2: S U _ N _  
We need a valid 5-letter word with this pattern.  
SU?N_ → common valid word: S U I N _  
Need a final letter that is unused and valid.  
S U I N _ → S U I N D (not valid), S U I N G (valid).

We haven’t tested G yet; G is still unused in any guess.

Word: S U I N G (but that’s 6 letters, not valid).  
Wait, actually SUING is 5 letters: S U I N G – yes, that’s a valid English word.

Check letters:  
S (1), U (2), I (3), N (4), G (5)  
- S – already ✓ in position 1.  
- U – now in position 2 (previously positions 3 were wrong, so this is new).  
- I and G are fresh letters to test.

Thus: SUING

   - S – must be in first position (✓ in both STUNT and SPUNK).  
   - N – must be in fourth position (✓ in both STUNT and SPUNK).  
3. Letter U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
   In STUNT it was in position 3, in SPUNK it was in position 3 again ⇒ U cannot be in position 3.  
   Therefore U must be in position 2 or 5.

Current word skeleton:  
S _ _ N _ or S _ _ N _ with U possibly in position 2 or 5.

Unused common letters: I, L, D, Y, C, B, F, H, G, M, W, V, etc.

Try U in position 2: S U _ N _  
We need a valid 5-letter word with this pattern.  
SU?N_ → common valid word: S U I N _  
Need a final letter that is unused and valid.  
S U I N _ → S U I N D (not valid), S U I N G (valid).

We haven’t tested G yet; G is still unused in any guess.

Word: S U I N G (but that’s 6 letters, not valid).  
Wait, actually SUING is 5 letters: S U I N G – yes, that’s a valid English word.

Check letters:  
S (1), U (2), I (3), N (4), G (5)  
- S – already ✓ in position 1.  
- U – now in position 2 (previously positions 3 were wrong, so this is new).  
- I and G are fresh letters to test.

Thus: SUING",Guess 4: SUING -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
