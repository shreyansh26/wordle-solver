For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by using letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common consonants (S, L, T) and the most common vowel (E), plus another vowel (A). This should give good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. Correct pattern: S _ _ _ _
2. A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not position 3 (since it got ""-"").
3. L, T, E are eliminated.

Common letters left to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.
I want a word that starts with S, contains A (not in position 3), and tests other common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCARF (S ✓, C, A - but position 3 is A which is invalid from feedback. Eliminate)
- SNARE (S ✓, N, A - but position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SHARP (S ✓, H, A - position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SAINT (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid since A can be here, I, N, T - but T is eliminated. Eliminate)

- STALK (S ✓, T is eliminated. Eliminate)
- SANDY (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid, N, D, Y. Good candidate)

Between SQUAD and SANDY, SANDY tests N and D (both common) and keeps A in a valid position (2). SQUAD tests Q which is rare, so SANDY seems better for elimination.

However, another good option is ""SNACK"" - S ✓, N, A in position 2 (valid), C, K. This tests N, C, K which are common.

Summary of what we know after three guesses:

1. S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _).
2. A is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from SLATE and SUGAR).  
   Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, N, C, K, U, G, R.
4. Still unused common consonants: D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, B.
5. Still unused vowels: I, O.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _  (A in position 2)  
- S _ _ A _  (A in position 4)

Let’s try S A _ _ _ and choose a word that uses fresh common letters.  
Candidate that fits: SAPID (S A P I D) – tests P, I, D.  
Another: SAMBA (tests M, B).  
Another: SAVVY (tests V, Y).

I’ll choose SAPID because it tests I (a vowel we haven’t used) and D, both common.

But wait, we must check if any letter has been eliminated:
- P, I, D have never appeared, so they’re fine.

So SAPID is valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain by using letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers very common consonants (S, L, T) and the most common vowel (E), plus another vowel (A). This should give good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. Correct pattern: S _ _ _ _
2. A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not position 3 (since it got ""-"").
3. L, T, E are eliminated.

Common letters left to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.
I want a word that starts with S, contains A (not in position 3), and tests other common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCARF (S ✓, C, A - but position 3 is A which is invalid from feedback. Eliminate)
- SNARE (S ✓, N, A - but position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SHARP (S ✓, H, A - position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SAINT (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid since A can be here, I, N, T - but T is eliminated. Eliminate)
- SQUAD (S ✓, Q, U, A in position 4 - valid, D. Good candidate)
- STALK (S ✓, T is eliminated. Eliminate)
- SANDY (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid, N, D, Y. Good candidate)

Between SQUAD and SANDY, SANDY tests N and D (both common) and keeps A in a valid position (2). SQUAD tests Q which is rare, so SANDY seems better for elimination.

However, another good option is ""SNACK"" - S ✓, N, A in position 2 (valid), C, K. This tests N, C, K which are common.

I'll go with SNACK to test N, C, K while keeping A in position 2 and S in position 1.

Guess 2: SNACK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) A(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SNACK:
- S is still correct in the first position (S _ _ _ _).

  In SNACK A is in position 3, so A cannot be in position 3, same conclusion as after SLATE.
- N, C, K are all “x” (not in the word at all).

Combining both turns:
Known so far
1. Word starts with S.
2. A appears somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, C, K.
4. Still unused common letters: R, I, D, M, G, H, P, U, Y, etc.

Since S _ _ _ _, A is inside but not in 3rd place, possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Good next word tries to place A usefully while testing fresh common letters.
Candidates:
- SARGE (A in 2 – valid) but G not yet tested.
- SCRAP – C was eliminated, so no.
- SWORD – O not yet tested, but no A.
- SPARK – P, R, K; but K eliminated.
- SHAFT – H, F, T; but T eliminated.
- SUGAR – U, G, R; A in 4 – valid, plus tests U and G.
- SAURY – A in 2 – valid, U, R, Y.

SUGAR tests U, G, R and places A in position 4, satisfying all constraints.

- A is in the word but not in the third position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. Correct pattern: S _ _ _ _
2. A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not position 3 (since it got ""-"").
3. L, T, E are eliminated.

Common letters left to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, etc.
I want a word that starts with S, contains A (not in position 3), and tests other common letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCARF (S ✓, C, A - but position 3 is A which is invalid from feedback. Eliminate)
- SNARE (S ✓, N, A - but position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SHARP (S ✓, H, A - position 3 is A. Eliminate)
- SAINT (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid since A can be here, I, N, T - but T is eliminated. Eliminate)
- SQUAD (S ✓, Q, U, A in position 4 - valid, D. Good candidate)
- STALK (S ✓, T is eliminated. Eliminate)
- SANDY (S ✓, A in position 2 - valid, N, D, Y. Good candidate)

Between SQUAD and SANDY, SANDY tests N and D (both common) and keeps A in a valid position (2). SQUAD tests Q which is rare, so SANDY seems better for elimination.

However, another good option is ""SNACK"" - S ✓, N, A in position 2 (valid), C, K. This tests N, C, K which are common.

I'll go with SNACK to test N, C, K while keeping A in position 2 and S in position 1.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SNACK:
- S is still correct in the first position (S _ _ _ _).
- A is again marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
  In SNACK A is in position 3, so A cannot be in position 3, same conclusion as after SLATE.
- N, C, K are all “x” (not in the word at all).

Combining both turns:
Known so far
1. Word starts with S.
2. A appears somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. Letters eliminated: L, T, E, N, C, K.
4. Still unused common letters: R, I, D, M, G, H, P, U, Y, etc.

Since S _ _ _ _, A is inside but not in 3rd place, possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Good next word tries to place A usefully while testing fresh common letters.
Candidates:
- SARGE (A in 2 – valid) but G not yet tested.
- SCRAP – C was eliminated, so no.
- SWORD – O not yet tested, but no A.
- SPARK – P, R, K; but K eliminated.
- SHAFT – H, F, T; but T eliminated.
- SUGAR – U, G, R; A in 4 – valid, plus tests U and G.
- SAURY – A in 2 – valid, U, R, Y.

SUGAR tests U, G, R and places A in position 4, satisfying all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after three guesses:

1. S is correct in position 1 (S _ _ _ _).
2. A is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from SLATE and SUGAR).  
   Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, N, C, K, U, G, R.
4. Still unused common consonants: D, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, B.
5. Still unused vowels: I, O.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _  (A in position 2)  
- S _ _ A _  (A in position 4)

Let’s try S A _ _ _ and choose a word that uses fresh common letters.  
Candidate that fits: SAPID (S A P I D) – tests P, I, D.  
Another: SAMBA (tests M, B).  
Another: SAVVY (tests V, Y).

I’ll choose SAPID because it tests I (a vowel we haven’t used) and D, both common.

But wait, we must check if any letter has been eliminated:
- P, I, D have never appeared, so they’re fine.

So SAPID is valid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have the first two letters locked in as S A _ _ _ (S ✓, A ✓).  
Letters we know are **not** in the word: L, T, E, N, C, K, U, G, R, P, I, D.  

Remaining unused common letters (still allowed):  
- Vowels: O  
- Consonants: B, F, H, M, V, W, Y  

So the pattern is S A _ _ _.  
We need three more letters that:
1. Haven’t been ruled out.
2. Can form valid 5-letter words.

Candidate words:  
- SAHIB – H, B valid.  
- SAMBA – M, B valid (but we have no B yet).  
- SABOT – uses O and B, but T is out.  
- SAVOR – V, O, R; but R is out.  
- SALVO – L is out.  
- SAFOY – F, O, Y all possible.  

The best choice is **SAHIB** – it tests H and B (both untested), and they are common.  
If SAHIB is wrong, we’ll quickly narrow it down.

Remaining available letters (common ones):  
Vowels: O, Y (sometimes)  
Consonants: F, M, V, W, Y, (and O is a vowel we haven’t placed)

So the word is S A _ _ _, and the last three letters must come from {F, M, V, W, O, Y}.
