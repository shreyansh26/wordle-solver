For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that might appear in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (✓).

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letter E somewhere other than the last position (positions 1-4).
- NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that uses a fresh set of high-frequency letters while preserving the E in a new position. A good next choice would be a word like:

- CRONE

But let’s pick one that has not reused any of the eliminated letters (S,L,A,T) and places E in a new position. I’ll go with ""CRONE"" because:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is placed in the 4th position, which is allowed since E is confirmed but not locked to position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R (in position 2) and E (in position 5).

The word structure therefore looks like: _ R _ _ E, and the remaining letters can only come from the alphabet minus {S,L,A,T,C,O,N}.

For the remaining positions (1, 3, 4) we need three distinct letters from the unused pool:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common English word that fits _R__E.

Of these, BRIDE is common, uses B (good high-frequency unused letter), plus D and I, both still allowed.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,GRIME,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that might appear in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (✓).

So the secret word must:
- Contain the letter E somewhere other than the last position (positions 1-4).
- NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that uses a fresh set of high-frequency letters while preserving the E in a new position. A good next choice would be a word like:

- CRONE
- PRONE
- DROWN
- GROVE

But let’s pick one that has not reused any of the eliminated letters (S,L,A,T) and places E in a new position. I’ll go with ""CRONE"" because:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters not yet tested.
- E is placed in the 4th position, which is allowed since E is confirmed but not locked to position 5.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R (in position 2) and E (in position 5).

The word structure therefore looks like: _ R _ _ E, and the remaining letters can only come from the alphabet minus {S,L,A,T,C,O,N}.

For the remaining positions (1, 3, 4) we need three distinct letters from the unused pool:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common English word that fits _R__E.

Some candidates:
- BRIDE
- GRIME
- PRIDE
- URINE
- DRIVE

Of these, BRIDE is common, uses B (good high-frequency unused letter), plus D and I, both still allowed.

Let’s guess BRIDE.

<guess>BRIDE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: BRIDE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Letters confirmed present: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5).
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, B, D.

So the pattern is: _ R I _ E, and the missing letters (positions 1 and 4) must come from the remaining unused letters.

Unused letters so far: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that fits the pattern _ R I _ E.

Possible candidates:
- FRISE (a botanical term, but not common)
- GRIPE (fits, but uses P)
- PRISE (variant of “pry”, but uses S which is excluded)
- TRIPE (uses T, excluded)
- FRISE (uses F, but rare)

Among these, GRIPE is the most common English word and uses letters G and P, neither of which has been ruled out.

Let’s go with GRIPE.

- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct third position.
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct fifth position.

So the known pattern is fixed:

Only the fourth letter is still unknown.

Letters already ruled out (x): S, L, A, T, C, O, N, B, D, P.

Letters still available for the fourth position: F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits G R I _ E.  
Think of common endings:  
- GRIME – uses M (still allowed)  
No other obvious common word comes to mind besides GRIME.

Therefore GRIME is the clear next guess.
