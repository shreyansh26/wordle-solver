For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English words are vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

A good starting word should include these common letters without repeating any, to test as many letters as possible. One popular starting word that fits this criteria is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions.

If I don't get any hits, I can then use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.

The feedback from AROSE (A x, R x, O x, S x, E x) tells me that none of those five letters are in the secret word at all.  
That completely eliminates A, R, O, S, E from consideration.

Since vowels are now scarce (we’ve ruled out A, O, E), I should still include some remaining common vowels (I, U) and high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out (T, N, L, D, etc.).  
A classic “second guess” that avoids the eliminated letters and covers the next tier of common letters is “UNTIL”.  
It uses two fresh vowels (U, I) and three very common consonants (N, T, L) without repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. A, R, O, S, E are completely absent.
2. U, T, I, L are all in the word but in the wrong positions (and N is absent).

So the secret word must use the letters U, T, I, L plus one additional letter that is not in {A,R,O,S,E,N}.  
The fifth letter must therefore come from the remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Popular remaining consonants first: D, C, H, M, P, K, B, G, F, Y, W.

We also know the exact wrong spots for U, T, I, L:

- U is not in position 1
- T is not in position 3
- I is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Let’s try to arrange U, T, I, L plus one new letter in a way that satisfies those constraints.

A simple idea: place the new letter in position 1, then arrange U, T, I, L in the remaining four slots such that none lands in its disallowed spot.

If we pick D as the extra letter:

D _ _ _ _

Trying positions:

D U T I L → positions: U(2), T(3) – but T can’t be in 3.  
D I T U L → positions: I(2), T(3) – still T in 3: invalid.  
D U L T I → positions: U(2), T(4), I(5), L(3) – all positions allowed.  
This arrangement is D U L T I.

Check letter set: {D, U, L, T, I} — none of the eliminated letters appear.  
Positions:
- U not in 1 ✔
- T not in 3 ✔
- I not in 4 ✔
- L not in 5 ✔

Therefore, DULTI is a valid next guess.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters still eligible: U, T, I, L (from earlier) plus any letters not yet excluded.  
Letters excluded so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, D.

Mandatory letters in the word: U (position 2)  
Letters that are present but must avoid their current positions:  
- L not in 3  
- T not in 3 or 4 (from earlier: T was position 3 in UNTIL and now position 4 in DULTI, both marked “-”)  
- I not in 4 or 5 (from earlier: I was position 4 in UNTIL and now position 5 in DULTI, both marked “-”)

So the fixed information:
- U must be in position 2.
- The remaining letters must come from {T, I, L} plus any other new letters not yet excluded (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be filled with these constraints:
- T cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 1 or 5
- I cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 3
- L cannot be in 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5
- We need a fifth distinct letter (not U, T, I, L, A, R, O, S, E, N, D)

Let’s try to place T, I, L plus one new letter to satisfy all constraints.

One promising arrangement: place T in position 5, I in position 3, L in position 4, and pick a new consonant for position 1.

Candidate new consonants: F is common. Try F in position 1.

So we get: F _ U _ _ but wait, we know U is in position 2. So word structure is:  
1: F  
2: U  
3: I (I not in 4 or 5, so I in 3 works)  
4: L (L not in 3, so 4 is allowed)  
5: T (T not in 3 or 4, so 5 is allowed)

This gives us F U I L T, i.e., ""FUILT"". But ""FUILT"" is not a valid English word.

Next try: H for position 1.

H U I L T → ""HUILT"" – invalid.

Next: M.

M U I L T → ""MUILT"" – not a word.

Next: B.

B U I L T → ""BUILT"" – this is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- B is new and allowed.
- U in position 2: ✓ (matches feedback).
- I not in 4 or 5: I is in 3 – ok.
- L not in 3: L is in 4 – ok.
- T not in 3 or 4: T is in 5 – ok.

Therefore, ""BUILT"" satisfies all constraints.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English words are vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

A good starting word should include these common letters without repeating any, to test as many letters as possible. One popular starting word that fits this criteria is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions.

If I don't get any hits, I can then use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE (A x, R x, O x, S x, E x) tells me that none of those five letters are in the secret word at all.  
That completely eliminates A, R, O, S, E from consideration.

Since vowels are now scarce (we’ve ruled out A, O, E), I should still include some remaining common vowels (I, U) and high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out (T, N, L, D, etc.).  
A classic “second guess” that avoids the eliminated letters and covers the next tier of common letters is “UNTIL”.  
It uses two fresh vowels (U, I) and three very common consonants (N, T, L) without repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. A, R, O, S, E are completely absent.
2. U, T, I, L are all in the word but in the wrong positions (and N is absent).

So the secret word must use the letters U, T, I, L plus one additional letter that is not in {A,R,O,S,E,N}.  
The fifth letter must therefore come from the remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Popular remaining consonants first: D, C, H, M, P, K, B, G, F, Y, W.

We also know the exact wrong spots for U, T, I, L:

- U is not in position 1
- T is not in position 3
- I is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Let’s try to arrange U, T, I, L plus one new letter in a way that satisfies those constraints.

A simple idea: place the new letter in position 1, then arrange U, T, I, L in the remaining four slots such that none lands in its disallowed spot.

If we pick D as the extra letter:

D _ _ _ _

Trying positions:

D U T I L → positions: U(2), T(3) – but T can’t be in 3.  
D I T U L → positions: I(2), T(3) – still T in 3: invalid.  
D U L T I → positions: U(2), T(4), I(5), L(3) – all positions allowed.  
This arrangement is D U L T I.

Check letter set: {D, U, L, T, I} — none of the eliminated letters appear.  
Positions:
- U not in 1 ✔
- T not in 3 ✔
- I not in 4 ✔
- L not in 5 ✔

Therefore, DULTI is a valid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English words are vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

A good starting word should include these common letters without repeating any, to test as many letters as possible. One popular starting word that fits this criteria is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions.

If I don't get any hits, I can then use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE (A x, R x, O x, S x, E x) tells me that none of those five letters are in the secret word at all.  
That completely eliminates A, R, O, S, E from consideration.

Since vowels are now scarce (we’ve ruled out A, O, E), I should still include some remaining common vowels (I, U) and high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out (T, N, L, D, etc.).  
A classic “second guess” that avoids the eliminated letters and covers the next tier of common letters is “UNTIL”.  
It uses two fresh vowels (U, I) and three very common consonants (N, T, L) without repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. A, R, O, S, E are completely absent.
2. U, T, I, L are all in the word but in the wrong positions (and N is absent).

So the secret word must use the letters U, T, I, L plus one additional letter that is not in {A,R,O,S,E,N}.  
The fifth letter must therefore come from the remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Popular remaining consonants first: D, C, H, M, P, K, B, G, F, Y, W.

We also know the exact wrong spots for U, T, I, L:

- U is not in position 1
- T is not in position 3
- I is not in position 4
- L is not in position 5

Let’s try to arrange U, T, I, L plus one new letter in a way that satisfies those constraints.

A simple idea: place the new letter in position 1, then arrange U, T, I, L in the remaining four slots such that none lands in its disallowed spot.

If we pick D as the extra letter:

D _ _ _ _

Trying positions:

D U T I L → positions: U(2), T(3) – but T can’t be in 3.  
D I T U L → positions: I(2), T(3) – still T in 3: invalid.  
D U L T I → positions: U(2), T(4), I(5), L(3) – all positions allowed.  
This arrangement is D U L T I.

Check letter set: {D, U, L, T, I} — none of the eliminated letters appear.  
Positions:
- U not in 1 ✔
- T not in 3 ✔
- I not in 4 ✔
- L not in 5 ✔

Therefore, DULTI is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: DULTI -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) L(-) T(-) I(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

Letters still eligible: U, T, I, L (from earlier) plus any letters not yet excluded.  
Letters excluded so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, D.

Mandatory letters in the word: U (position 2)  
Letters that are present but must avoid their current positions:  
- L not in 3  
- T not in 3 or 4 (from earlier: T was position 3 in UNTIL and now position 4 in DULTI, both marked “-”)  
- I not in 4 or 5 (from earlier: I was position 4 in UNTIL and now position 5 in DULTI, both marked “-”)

So the fixed information:
- U must be in position 2.
- The remaining letters must come from {T, I, L} plus any other new letters not yet excluded (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 need to be filled with these constraints:
- T cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in 1 or 5
- I cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1 or 3
- L cannot be in 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5
- We need a fifth distinct letter (not U, T, I, L, A, R, O, S, E, N, D)

Let’s try to place T, I, L plus one new letter to satisfy all constraints.

One promising arrangement: place T in position 5, I in position 3, L in position 4, and pick a new consonant for position 1.

Candidate new consonants: F is common. Try F in position 1.

So we get: F _ U _ _ but wait, we know U is in position 2. So word structure is:  
1: F  
2: U  
3: I (I not in 4 or 5, so I in 3 works)  
4: L (L not in 3, so 4 is allowed)  
5: T (T not in 3 or 4, so 5 is allowed)

This gives us F U I L T, i.e., ""FUILT"". But ""FUILT"" is not a valid English word.

Next try: H for position 1.

H U I L T → ""HUILT"" – invalid.

Next: M.

M U I L T → ""MUILT"" – not a word.

Next: B.

B U I L T → ""BUILT"" – this is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- B is new and allowed.
- U in position 2: ✓ (matches feedback).
- I not in 4 or 5: I is in 3 – ok.
- L not in 3: L is in 4 – ok.
- T not in 3 or 4: T is in 5 – ok.

Therefore, ""BUILT"" satisfies all constraints.

Guess 4: BUILT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on BUILT we now know the exact placement of four letters:

1. U must be in position 2 (✓ in both attempts where it appeared there).
2. I is in position 3 (✓).
3. L is in position 4 (✓).
4. T is in position 5 (✓).

The only unknown is position 1.  
Letters already ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, D, B.  
The first letter must therefore be one of the remaining consonants not yet used: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Trying the most common remaining consonants first:

- C → yields CUILT – invalid (not a word).
- F → yields FUILT – invalid.
- G → yields GUILT – valid English word.

G, U, I, L, T → GUILT satisfies all constraints.
