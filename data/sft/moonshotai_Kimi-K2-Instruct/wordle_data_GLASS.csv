- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
- No repeating letters, which gives more information.

This word is likely to provide useful feedback on multiple letters, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
- No repeating letters, which gives more information.

This word is likely to provide useful feedback on multiple letters, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We now know the exact placement of four letters:

Position 2: L  
Position 3: A  
Position 4: S  
Position 5: ?  (but H was just ruled out)  

So the pattern is: _ L A S _  

Letters eliminated so far for position 1: S, T, E, F, K, C, N, D, R, M, B  
Letters eliminated for position 5: T, E, K, N, M, H  

Remaining unused common letters: G, P, V, W, Y  

Quick scan of English 5-letter words ending in “-LAS-?” (with the fixed L-A-S in positions 2–4) and starting with one of G, P, V, W, Y:

- GLASS – but S is already present in position 4, and duplicate letters are allowed in feedback, so let’s check: G L A S S  

G is still free; S in position 5 is acceptable (feedback on a repeated letter would simply confirm or deny its presence). No prior elimination blocks this choice.

No other valid words like PLASS, VLASS, WLASS, YLASS exist.

Therefore GLASS is the only remaining plausible word.
