As this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word that contains common, high-frequency letters (like vowels and common consonants) to maximize the information gained. A good first guess might include letters such as E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

After considering several options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These are all high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words
- It will give good coverage to test many common letters at once

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but is NOT in position 1.
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- DOES contain A, but A is not in the first position.

We now eliminate all words that contain R, O, S, or E, and focus on 5-letter words that contain the letter A somewhere in positions 2–5.

Common remaining consonants that have not been tested yet include: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters that haven’t appeared yet and still include the known letter A (but not in the first position). “PLANT” is a solid choice because:
- P, L, N, T are all new and common consonants.
- A appears in position 2 (which is allowed, since A is not in position 1 but can be elsewhere).
- It tests 5 new letters while respecting the constraints.

Let's decode what we know so far:

- A is in the word, but not at position 1 (from AROSE) and not at position 3 (from PLANT). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

- L, R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far, the word pattern is: P _ _ N T with A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is N, so A must be in position 2 or 3.

Letters we've eliminated: R, O, S, E, L.

Letters we know are in the word: P, A, N, T.

Letters we haven't tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since positions 1, 4, 5 are fixed as P _ _ N T, and A must be in position 2 or 3, let's consider both cases:

Case 1: A in position 2 → P A _ N T
Possible letters for position 3: remaining consonants not used yet (can't be R, O, S, E, L, P, A, N, T). Valid options: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Case 2: A in position 3 → P _ A N T
But then position 2 would have to be a consonant not used yet, but we don't have any constraints on it.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching these patterns:
- PAINT: P A I N T - but I hasn't been tested yet
- PANTS: P A N T S - but S is eliminated
- PAINT seems possible (P A I N T) - letters P,A,I,N,T - all allowed so far.

Let's go with PAINT as it fits P A _ N T and uses the new letter I which we haven't tested yet.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- P is correctly placed at position 1
- N is correctly placed at position 4
- T is correctly placed at position 5
- A is in the word but not at positions 1 or 3, so must be at 2 or 4. Position 4 is N, so A must be at position 2
- The remaining letters R,O,S,E,L are eliminated

Thus the word must be P A _ N T. The most common letter to fit is I, making PAINT.
