For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained. Based on frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with **STARE** as it contains S, T, A, R, E which are all very common letters and should help reveal information about the secret word quickly.

From the feedback on STARE we know:

• S and T are NOT in the word (x).  
• R and E ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions (-).  
• A is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word contains at least an R and an E, and does not contain S, T, or A.  
R and E are currently in positions 4 and 5, so they must appear elsewhere in the word.

To maximize new information I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps R and E but moves them to new positions.  
2. Introduces new common consonants like N, L, D, H, etc.  
3. Avoids S, T, and A.

A good candidate is “NERDY”:
- Uses N, E, R, D, Y.  
- Puts E in position 2 and R in position 3.  
- Introduces N, D, and Y which haven’t been tested yet.  
- Avoids S, T, and A.

From the new feedback on OLDER:

- D, E, R are all in the correct positions: D(✓) in spot 3, E(✓) in spot 4, R(✓) in spot 5.  
- This fixes the last three letters as DER.  
- O and L are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word must be of the form: _ _ D E R.

Letters still unused but not yet ruled out (from the English alphabet except S, T, A, N, Y, O, L) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, the most common first-letter options in 5-letter words are B, C, F, G, H, I, M, P.

The second letter must combine with one of these to form a valid word ending in DER.

Quick scan of possible English words ending in DER: BIDER, CIDER, FADER, GUDER, HIDER, MUDER, PUDER, WIDER, etc.

Among these, “CIDER” stands out because:
- C and I haven’t been tested yet.
- It’s a common word.

Let’s check the letters against what we know:
- C, I: not yet tested → allowed.
- D, E, R: in correct positions → matches feedback.

So the next guess should be CIDER.
