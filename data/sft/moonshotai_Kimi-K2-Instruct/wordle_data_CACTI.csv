As the first guess, I want to choose a word that will maximize the information gained about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a common 5-letter word with frequently used letters in the English language. Common starting letters include A, E, T, O, etc., so I’ll aim for a word like ""AROSE,"" which contains highly frequent letters: A, R, O, S, E. This should give a broad initial coverage of possible letters and their positions.

- a(-) : the letter A is somewhere in the secret word but NOT in position 1.
- r(x), o(x), s(x), e(x) : the letters R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

- Contains A (position 2), uses common consonants T and N.

From the new feedback on “taint”:
- T(-) : T is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.
- A(✓) : A is in the word and is in position 2.
- I(-) : I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- N(x) : N is not in the word at all.
- T(-) (second T) : same as first T.

So far we know:
1. Word has the form _A___ (position 2 is A).
2. Contains T and I, but T is not in positions 1 or 5, and I is not in position 3.
3. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, N.
4. We need 3 more letters (positions 1,3,4,5) from the remaining alphabet.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess would place T and I in positions we haven’t ruled out, while keeping A locked in position 2. A word like “CATCH” would re-introduce C and H but we already know A is fixed at position 2 so let’s think of a word that uses T, I, and new letters.

A candidate is “LATCH” but L, T, C, H are consonants and we need to cover vowels too. Let’s try “HABIT”:
- H, A, B, I, T → H(1), A(2)✓, B(3), I(4), T(5)
But we know T is not in position 5, so HABIT would be invalid (T in 5).

Instead, try “PATIO” — but O is eliminated.

Next try “FAINT” — but N is eliminated.

Let’s try “MATHY” — but Y is less common.

A better candidate is “MATHY” but maybe “MATHS” — but S is eliminated.

Another candidate: “PATCH” — A is in position 2, but P, A, T, C, H. T would be in position 3 (allowed since T is in word and this position wasn’t ruled out).

But we need to include I somewhere. Let’s try “LAITY” — L, A, I, T, Y. A is position 2, I is position 3 (but I cannot be in position 3). So this is invalid.

Trying “DIALS” — S is eliminated.

Let’s try “GAMIC” — but C is rare.

Instead, let’s try “HABIT” again but adjust. Actually, we cannot use T in position 5. Let’s try “TABID” — but D is allowed.

Wait, simpler: word _ A _ _ _ with T and I somewhere else. A clear candidate is “TAFFY” but F is less common.

Let’s try “BASIL” — but S is eliminated.

Let me think systematically: positions are 1,2,3,4,5 with A fixed in 2:
_ A _ _ _

Letters left to use: T and I (and three others), with constraints:
- T not in 1 or 5
- I not in 3

Let’s try “CAVIT” — but T would be in 5 (invalid).

Try “CABIT” — but B is allowed, I in position 4, T in 5 (invalid).

Try “VATIC” — V is ok, T in 3, I in 4, C in 5.

This word uses:
V(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), C(5)
- T is in 3 (allowed)
- I is in 4 (allowed)
- Uses new letters V and C
- No eliminated letters

So “VATIC” seems like a good next guess.

A better candidate is “MATHY” but maybe “MATHS” — but S is eliminated.

Another candidate: “PATCH” — A is in position 2, but P, A, T, C, H. T would be in position 3 (allowed since T is in word and this position wasn’t ruled out).

But we need to include I somewhere. Let’s try “LAITY” — L, A, I, T, Y. A is position 2, I is position 3 (but I cannot be in position 3). So this is invalid.

Trying “DIALS” — S is eliminated.

Let’s try “GAMIC” — but C is rare.

Instead, let’s try “HABIT” again but adjust. Actually, we cannot use T in position 5. Let’s try “TABID” — but D is allowed.

Wait, simpler: word _ A _ _ _ with T and I somewhere else. A clear candidate is “TAFFY” but F is less common.

Let’s try “BASIL” — but S is eliminated.

Let me think systematically: positions are 1,2,3,4,5 with A fixed in 2:
_ A _ _ _

Letters left to use: T and I (and three others), with constraints:
- T not in 1 or 5
- I not in 3

Let’s try “CAVIT” — but T would be in 5 (invalid).

Try “CABIT” — but B is allowed, I in position 4, T in 5 (invalid).

Try “VATIC” — V is ok, T in 3, I in 4, C in 5.

This word uses:
V(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), C(5)
- T is in 3 (allowed)
- I is in 4 (allowed)
- Uses new letters V and C
- No eliminated letters

So “VATIC” seems like a good next guess.

Summary of everything we know:

1. Word structure: _ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, N, V.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain:
   - T (cannot be in 1, 3, or 5)
   - I (cannot be in 3)
   - C (cannot be in 5)

Therefore:
- T must be in position 4 (only remaining slot for it).
- I must be in position 1, 4, or 5; but 4 is now taken by T, so I must be in 1 or 5.
- C must be in position 3 (only remaining slot for it after ruling out 5).

That forces:
- Position 3 = C
- Position 4 = T
- Position 1 or 5 = I

So the two possible patterns so far:
Pattern 1: I A C T _
Pattern 2: _ A C T I

We need a common 5-letter English word fitting one of these patterns.

Looking at Pattern 1: I A C T _
Trying to complete with a legal letter: IACT_ — no valid word.

Looking at Pattern 2: _ A C T I
Filling the blank with remaining legal letters (B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.) and checking, we quickly see:

- H A C T I is not a valid English word.
- P A C T I is not valid.
- L A C T I → ""LACTI"" is not a word.
- F A C T I → ""FACTI"" not valid.
- G A C T I → ""GACTI"" not valid.
- D A C T I → ""DACTI"" not valid.
- M A C T I → ""MACTI"" not valid.
- B A C T I → ""BACTI"" not valid.
- U A C T I → ""UACTI"" not valid.

Wait, let’s double-check the remaining alphabet again. All listed above are invalid. The only remaining common letter not yet considered is “L” and “LACTI” isn’t valid.

Realizing I may have missed a letter: the letter “Y” is still available.

- Y A C T I → ""YACTI"" not valid.

This suggests a rethink: maybe C could go elsewhere, but we ruled out C in 5, and it can’t go in 1 (no word starts C A ...), 2 is A, 4 is T, so 3 is only possible for C.

Therefore, the only pattern left is _ A C T I, but no valid word. This indicates I made a mistake in deduction.

Rechecking: is there any other placement of C?

C cannot be in 5, 2, or 4 (T), and cannot be in 1 (word would be C A T I _, but T is already assigned to 4). So 3 is indeed forced for C.

Thus, the only candidate is L A C T I, but that’s “lacti” which is not a standard 5-letter English word.

Realizing ""TACIT"" fits: T A C I T. But that repeats T twice (we only know one T is in the word from feedback), and A is in position 2. Moreover, we were told T cannot be in position 1 or 5. So ""TACIT"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CACTI"" — but C is repeated and position 1 is C which violates no info yet, but A is in 2, C in 3, T in 4, so ""CACTI"" would be C A C T I. This uses C twice, but we have no info on multiple Cs. However, ""CACTI"" is a valid English word and fits the constraints except we don’t know if C can repeat.

Let me check if any simpler word exists. The only pattern fitting all constraints is _ A C T I. The only valid word is ""TACIT"" but again T is in 1 and 5 which is invalid.

Realizing the mistake: I is allowed in position 1 or 5, C in 3, T in 4. Thus, the only valid English word left fitting this is ""CACTI"" (C A C T I) — though it uses C twice, there's no evidence against that yet.

But ""CACTI"" is a plural, and we might prefer singular. Given constraints, it seems the only possible word.

Alternative check: is ""M"" available? ""MACTI"" no. ""LACTI"" no. ""PACTI"" no.

Conclusion: the only possible remaining valid 5-letter English word fitting all constraints is ""CACTI"", despite the double C.
