From the feedback:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1 (it appeared with “-”).
- R is NOT in the word (it appeared with “x”).
- O is NOT in the word (it appeared with “x”).
- S is NOT in the word (it appeared with “x”).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (it appeared with “-”).

So:
- Letters to keep: A, E (they are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S.
- We still have no information about the other common consonants (T, N, L, C, H, etc.).

Let’s choose a second guess that:
- Includes A and E in different positions.
- Avoids R, O, S.
- Introduces other common consonants (T, N, L).

One good candidate is “TALEA” but that repeats A in position 4 (and A is already known to be somewhere else). Another candidate is “NEATH”, but it uses H. Another good one is “CLEAN” – it has C, L, E, A, N, none of which have been ruled out except none of the positions of A or E are confirmed yet.

Let’s go with “CLEAN”:

Let’s assemble candidates:
- ECLA? needs a 5th letter – “ECLAD” not valid.  
- “PLACE” – A in 4, E in 5 (but E cannot be in 5).  
- “PEACH” – A in 4, E in 2.  Uses P, C, H.  C is in 3 (allowed), L is missing.  
- “CHELA” – A in 5 (but A must be in 4).  
- “CLEAT” – A in 4, E in 3 (but E cannot be in 3).  
- “LACEY” – A in 3 (wrong).  
- “PECAL” – invalid.  
- “DECAL” – A in 4, E in 2.  Uses D, E, C, A, L.  C in 3 (ok), L in 5 (ok), E in 2 (ok).  All letters are allowed, fits every clue.

So “DECAL” seems perfect.

We already know from earlier rounds that:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. 

A great starting word would include several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which covers 5 of the most common letters. Other good options might be ""STARE"", ""ARISE"", or ""SLATE"".

- O is NOT in the word (it appeared with “x”).
- S is NOT in the word (it appeared with “x”).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (it appeared with “-”).

So:
- Letters to keep: A, E (they are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S.
- We still have no information about the other common consonants (T, N, L, C, H, etc.).

Guesses so far:
1. AROSE – A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(-)

Let’s choose a second guess that:
- Includes A and E in different positions.
- Avoids R, O, S.
- Introduces other common consonants (T, N, L).

One good candidate is “TALEA” but that repeats A in position 4 (and A is already known to be somewhere else). Another candidate is “NEATH”, but it uses H. Another good one is “CLEAN” – it has C, L, E, A, N, none of which have been ruled out except none of the positions of A or E are confirmed yet.

Let’s go with “CLEAN”:
- C – new letter
- L – new letter
