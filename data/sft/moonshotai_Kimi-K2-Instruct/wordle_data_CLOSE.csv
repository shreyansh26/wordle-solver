Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback to narrow down the possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A, E (vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)

Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify vowels and consonants early. 

Therefore, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are ruled out completely.
- O, S, E are all in the word, but none are in the positions we guessed (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E somewhere other than positions 3, 4, 5. We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, E in some order, not in positions 3, 4, 5.
- Uses two additional distinct letters (since O, S, E are already 3 of the 5 letters).

Good candidate positions for O, S, E:
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with other consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

One approach is to try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, and E in position 3, but position 3 is available for E (since E was in position 5 originally). That would give us O S _ E _, but we need two more letters. 

Alternatively, let’s try placing S in position 1, O in position 2, and E in position 4 (since E was originally in position 5, position 4 is allowed). Then we need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. 

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for positions 3 and 5 that haven’t been used yet and are common: N, T, L, etc. 

A word that fits is ""SONET"" (though this might not be valid in English). ""STONE"" is better, but we can’t use T in position 4 (E is there). 

Another attempt: place S in position 1, E in position 2, O in position 4. Then we have S E _ O _. Possible completions: ""SEWON"" (invalid), ""SEDOL"" (invalid), ""SETON"" (valid, a type of medical thread). ""SETON"" seems like a valid word.

But let me think of more common words. 

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 2, O in position 3: but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 3, O in position 2: E S O _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""ESPOI"" (invalid), ""ESCON"" (invalid).

Another approach: place O in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3: O E S _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""OESIC"" (invalid), ""OESUM"" (invalid), ""OESTE"" (invalid).

Let me step back and think of valid 5-letter words that contain O, S, E but not A or R. 

Possible words:
- NOSES: but S is in position 4, which was S’s original position - invalid (S was in position 4 originally, so it cannot be in position 4 again).
- POSED: D is new, but O is in position 2 (original was position 3 - allowed), S in position 3 (original was 4 - allowed), E in position 5 (original was 5 - invalid, E cannot be in position 5).
- DOSES: O in position 2, S in position 3 and 5, E in position 4 - but S cannot be in position 4 (it’s in 3 and 5 here, so position 4 is E which is allowed), but we have two S's which might not be the case.
- LOSES: L, O, S, E, S - again double S, and E is in position 5 (invalid).
- MOUSE: M, O, U, S, E - O in position 2, U is new, S in 4 (invalid, was originally 4), E in 5 (invalid).
- HOSES: H, O, S, E, S - double S, E in 5 (invalid).
- NOSEY: N, O, S, E, Y - O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, Y is new. This seems valid - no A or R, O not in 3, S not in 4, E not in 5.

Thus, ""NOSEY"" seems like a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
   - A and R are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the secret word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5.

   - N and Y are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the word again, but this time each is in the wrong position (they each got “-”).

Combining the two:
- O, S, E must all appear somewhere in the word, but
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 2 (from NOSEY).
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 3 (from NOSEY).
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 4 (from NOSEY).

  S: 1, 2, 5   (but not 3 or 4)
  E: 1, 2, 3   (but not 4 or 5)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,CLOSE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback to narrow down the possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A, E (vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)

Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify vowels and consonants early. 

Therefore, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are ruled out completely.
- O, S, E are all in the word, but none are in the positions we guessed (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E somewhere other than positions 3, 4, 5. We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, E in some order, not in positions 3, 4, 5.
- Uses two additional distinct letters (since O, S, E are already 3 of the 5 letters).

Good candidate positions for O, S, E:
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with other consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

One approach is to try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, and E in position 3, but position 3 is available for E (since E was in position 5 originally). That would give us O S _ E _, but we need two more letters. 

Alternatively, let’s try placing S in position 1, O in position 2, and E in position 4 (since E was originally in position 5, position 4 is allowed). Then we need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. 

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for positions 3 and 5 that haven’t been used yet and are common: N, T, L, etc. 

A word that fits is ""SONET"" (though this might not be valid in English). ""STONE"" is better, but we can’t use T in position 4 (E is there). 

Another attempt: place S in position 1, E in position 2, O in position 4. Then we have S E _ O _. Possible completions: ""SEWON"" (invalid), ""SEDOL"" (invalid), ""SETON"" (valid, a type of medical thread). ""SETON"" seems like a valid word.

But let me think of more common words. 

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 2, O in position 3: but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 3, O in position 2: E S O _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""ESPOI"" (invalid), ""ESCON"" (invalid).

Another approach: place O in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3: O E S _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""OESIC"" (invalid), ""OESUM"" (invalid), ""OESTE"" (invalid).

Let me step back and think of valid 5-letter words that contain O, S, E but not A or R. 

Possible words:
- NOSES: but S is in position 4, which was S’s original position - invalid (S was in position 4 originally, so it cannot be in position 4 again).
- POSED: D is new, but O is in position 2 (original was position 3 - allowed), S in position 3 (original was 4 - allowed), E in position 5 (original was 5 - invalid, E cannot be in position 5).
- DOSES: O in position 2, S in position 3 and 5, E in position 4 - but S cannot be in position 4 (it’s in 3 and 5 here, so position 4 is E which is allowed), but we have two S's which might not be the case.
- LOSES: L, O, S, E, S - again double S, and E is in position 5 (invalid).
- MOUSE: M, O, U, S, E - O in position 2, U is new, S in 4 (invalid, was originally 4), E in 5 (invalid).
- HOSES: H, O, S, E, S - double S, E in 5 (invalid).
- NOSEY: N, O, S, E, Y - O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, Y is new. This seems valid - no A or R, O not in 3, S not in 4, E not in 5.

Thus, ""NOSEY"" seems like a good next guess.

<guess>NOSEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

   - N and Y are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the word again, but this time each is in the wrong position (they each got “-”).

Combining the two:
- O, S, E must all appear somewhere in the word, but
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 2 (from NOSEY).
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 3 (from NOSEY).
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 4 (from NOSEY).

So the only possible positions left are:
  O: 1, 4, 5   (but not 2 or 3)
  S: 1, 2, 5   (but not 3 or 4)
  E: 1, 2, 3   (but not 4 or 5)

Also, we have not yet used the letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. We need two more distinct, as-yet-unused letters to fill the remaining two slots.

Let me tabulate the constraints so far.

Letters we know are in the target word: O, S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the target word: A, R, N, Y, H  
Letters we have not tried yet (but may or may not be in the word): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Position constraints for O, S, E

- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from NOSEY, AROSE, ECHOS feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for O: 1 or 5.

- S cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 (from NOSEY, AROSE, ECHOS feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for S: 1 or 2.

- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from ECHOS, AROSE, NOSEY feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for E: 2 or 3.

So we must place:
- O in 1 or 5  
- S in 1 or 2  
- E in 2 or 3  

In addition we need two more distinct letters chosen from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z}.

Let me enumerate the viable arrangements.

Case 1: O in position 1  
 Case 1a: S in position 2  
  Then E must be in position 3  
  Word so far: O S E _ _  
  We need two new consonants for positions 4 and 5, avoiding all letters already ruled out.  
  Plausible real words:  
  - O S E L D → “OSLED” (valid: past tense of ose)  
  - O S E L M → “OSELM” (not a word)  
  - O S E B D → “OSEBD” (invalid)  
  - O S E T T → invalid  
  “OSLED” is the only recognizable candidate here.

 Case 1b: S in position 1  
  But O is already in position 1 → impossible.

Case 2: O in position 5  
 Case 2a: S in position 1  
  E must be in position 2 or 3  
  2a-i: E in position 2 → S E _ _ O  
   Need two new consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
   Real word: S E P T O → “SEPTO” (a rare combining form) – still valid; letters S,E,P,T,O are all allowed so far.

   Real word: S P E W O → “SPEWO” (slang) – non-standard.  
   Real word: S L E D O → “SLEDO” – non-standard.  
   Real word: S W E D O – no.  
   Not very promising.

 Case 2b: S in position 2

  - L S E T O → “LSETO” (invalid)  
  - B S E T O → “BSETO” (invalid)  
  No common English word seems to fit.

Among all these, the clearest legitimate word is “OSLED” (from Case 1a).  
It satisfies every constraint:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters A, R, N, Y, H are absent.
- Uses two new consonants L and D.

Therefore the next guess is OSLED.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,CLOSE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback to narrow down the possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A, E (vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)

Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify vowels and consonants early. 

Therefore, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are ruled out completely.
- O, S, E are all in the word, but none are in the positions we guessed (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E somewhere other than positions 3, 4, 5. We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, E in some order, not in positions 3, 4, 5.
- Uses two additional distinct letters (since O, S, E are already 3 of the 5 letters).

Good candidate positions for O, S, E:
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with other consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

One approach is to try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, and E in position 3, but position 3 is available for E (since E was in position 5 originally). That would give us O S _ E _, but we need two more letters. 

Alternatively, let’s try placing S in position 1, O in position 2, and E in position 4 (since E was originally in position 5, position 4 is allowed). Then we need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. 

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for positions 3 and 5 that haven’t been used yet and are common: N, T, L, etc. 

A word that fits is ""SONET"" (though this might not be valid in English). ""STONE"" is better, but we can’t use T in position 4 (E is there). 

Another attempt: place S in position 1, E in position 2, O in position 4. Then we have S E _ O _. Possible completions: ""SEWON"" (invalid), ""SEDOL"" (invalid), ""SETON"" (valid, a type of medical thread). ""SETON"" seems like a valid word.

But let me think of more common words. 

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 2, O in position 3: but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 3, O in position 2: E S O _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""ESPOI"" (invalid), ""ESCON"" (invalid).

Another approach: place O in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3: O E S _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""OESIC"" (invalid), ""OESUM"" (invalid), ""OESTE"" (invalid).

Let me step back and think of valid 5-letter words that contain O, S, E but not A or R. 

Possible words:
- NOSES: but S is in position 4, which was S’s original position - invalid (S was in position 4 originally, so it cannot be in position 4 again).
- POSED: D is new, but O is in position 2 (original was position 3 - allowed), S in position 3 (original was 4 - allowed), E in position 5 (original was 5 - invalid, E cannot be in position 5).
- DOSES: O in position 2, S in position 3 and 5, E in position 4 - but S cannot be in position 4 (it’s in 3 and 5 here, so position 4 is E which is allowed), but we have two S's which might not be the case.
- LOSES: L, O, S, E, S - again double S, and E is in position 5 (invalid).
- MOUSE: M, O, U, S, E - O in position 2, U is new, S in 4 (invalid, was originally 4), E in 5 (invalid).
- HOSES: H, O, S, E, S - double S, E in 5 (invalid).
- NOSEY: N, O, S, E, Y - O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, Y is new. This seems valid - no A or R, O not in 3, S not in 4, E not in 5.

Thus, ""NOSEY"" seems like a good next guess.

<guess>NOSEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOSEY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
   - A and R are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the secret word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5.

2. NOSEY → N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)
   - N and Y are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the word again, but this time each is in the wrong position (they each got “-”).

Combining the two:
- O, S, E must all appear somewhere in the word, but
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 2 (from NOSEY).
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 3 (from NOSEY).
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 4 (from NOSEY).

So the only possible positions left are:
  O: 1, 4, 5   (but not 2 or 3)
  S: 1, 2, 5   (but not 3 or 4)
  E: 1, 2, 3   (but not 4 or 5)

Also, we have not yet used the letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. We need two more distinct, as-yet-unused letters to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s place the known letters first and then pick two new ones.

Option 1: Put O in 1, S in 2, E in 3 → O S E _ _
   Need two new consonants.  Good choices that make a real word: “O” + “S” + “E” + “L” + “D” → O S E L D → “O S E L D” is not a recognized 5-letter word.  
   “O S E L” + “M” → “OSELM” – no.

Option 2: Put S in 1, E in 2, O in 4 → S E _ O _
   Need two new consonants.  A common 5-letter word fitting is S E T O N (“seton” – surgical thread).  That uses T (new) and N (ruled out already), so invalid.

Option 3: Put E in 1, S in 2, O in 5 → E S _ _ O
   Need two new consonants.  A valid word: E S C O T → but that repeats O.  Actually ESCEO, ESBRO, ESPOO – nothing obvious.

Option 4: Put E in 1, O in 4, S in 5 → E _ _ O S
   Need two middle letters.  Real word: E L B O S – no; E L M O S – no; E L V O S – no.  
   “E V O K S” – no.

Option 5: Put S in 1, O in 4, E in 2 → S E _ O _
   Real word: S E C O N – no; S E D O N – no; S E M O N – no.

Option 6: Put S in 1, O in 5, E in 3 → S _ E _ O
   Real word: S P E E D – E is in 3, good, but D is new, P is new; let’s check letters: S, P, E, E, O – double E is possible.  “SPEED” is a valid 5-letter word.  
   Check constraints:
      – Contains S, E, O.
      – Positions: S=1 (allowed), P=new, E=3 (allowed), E=4 (but E cannot be in 4) – fails.

Option 7: Put O in 1, S in 5, E in 3 → O _ E _ S
   Real word: O B E Y S – Y already ruled out.  
   O V E R S – R already ruled out.  
   O P E N S – N already ruled out.  
   O L E G S – G is new, L is new.  “OLEGS” – plural of oleg?  Not standard.  
   But “OLEGS” is not recognized.  “OBEYS” invalid due to Y.

Option 8: Put O in 4, S in 1, E in 2 → S E _ O _
   Same as option 2.

Option 9: Put O in 4, S in 5, E in 1 → E _ _ O S
   Real word: E C H O S – E=1, C=new, H=new, O=4, S=5.  Letters used: E, C, H, O, S.
   Check constraints:
      – No A, R, N, Y.
      – O is in position 4 (allowed: not 2 or 3).
      – S is in position 5 (allowed: not 3 or 4).
      – E is in position 1 (allowed: not 4 or 5).
   “ECHOS” is a standard English word.

So the best next guess is ECHOS.

Among all these, the clearest legitimate word is “OSLED” (from Case 1a).  
It satisfies every constraint:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters A, R, N, Y, H are absent.
- Uses two new consonants L and D.

Therefore the next guess is OSLED.

Let’s consolidate every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word: O, S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, N, Y, H, D, C, L  
Still-unused/allowed letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Position constraints:

O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 1.  
S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 1.  
E cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 2.

But both O and S are required to be in position 1, which is impossible in a single 5-letter word.

This contradiction tells us that the earlier assumption of only O, S, E being present must be wrong; one of them must appear twice, or another letter must also be in the word.  However, the feedback has consistently marked each of O, S, E with “-” (present but wrong place) and never “✓”, so each of them must appear exactly once (Wordle / standard rules: a letter only gets one mark per guess).

Since the constraints now lead to a logical impossibility, the only way forward is to backtrack and conclude that our earlier candidate “OSLED” must have mis-positioned the required letters.  Rechecking, we see that the feedback for OSLED gave “-” for every one of O, S, L, E, which confirmed none of them were in their correct spots.  This actually tightens the positional bans further:

After OSLED feedback:
- O cannot be in position 1 → O must be in position 5 (only remaining slot).  
- S cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1 (only remaining slot).  
- E cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 2 (only remaining slot).

So the word must be:

Position 1: S  
Position 2: E  
Position 3: _  
Position 4: _  
Position 5: O  

We now need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 that are:
- Not in {A,R,N,Y,H,D,C,L}  
- Not duplicates of S, E, O.

Still-available letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E _ _ O.

Looking through Scrabble-valid English 5-letter words that fit S E ?? O:

- S E B O O – invalid (double O)  
- S E M P O – invalid  
- S E T O N – but N is banned  
- S E T T O – but T T duplicates, and T is allowed  
- S E T T O – actually “setto” is archaic but valid.  
- S E R V O – R banned  
- S E G U O – no  
- S E G N O – no  
- S E G O ? – no  
- S E P T O – “septo” (prefix) valid  

The cleanest valid word is “SEBRO” but R is banned.  “SEPTO” is valid (as septo-, combining form).  It uses S, E, P, T, O with P and T both allowed.  It fits every constraint.

Therefore the next guess is SEPTO.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to choose a word that contains a variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A, E (vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)

Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify vowels and consonants early.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are ruled out completely.
- O, S, E are all in the word, but none are in the positions we guessed (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

So the secret word contains the letters O, S, E somewhere other than positions 3, 4, 5. We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, E in some order, not in positions 3, 4, 5.
- Uses two additional distinct letters (since O, S, E are already 3 of the 5 letters).

Good candidate positions for O, S, E:
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with other consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

One approach is to try placing O in position 1, S in position 2, and E in position 3, but position 3 is available for E (since E was in position 5 originally). That would give us O S _ E _, but we need two more letters. 

Alternatively, let’s try placing S in position 1, O in position 2, and E in position 4 (since E was originally in position 5, position 4 is allowed). Then we need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. 

Let’s try S O _ E _. Possible letters for positions 3 and 5 that haven’t been used yet and are common: N, T, L, etc. 

A word that fits is ""SONET"" (though this might not be valid in English). ""STONE"" is better, but we can’t use T in position 4 (E is there). 

Another attempt: place S in position 1, E in position 2, O in position 4. Then we have S E _ O _. Possible completions: ""SEWON"" (invalid), ""SEDOL"" (invalid), ""SETON"" (valid, a type of medical thread). ""SETON"" seems like a valid word.

But let me think of more common words. 

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 2, O in position 3: but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).

Try placing E in position 1, S in position 3, O in position 2: E S O _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""ESPOI"" (invalid), ""ESCON"" (invalid).

Another approach: place O in position 1, E in position 2, S in position 3: O E S _ _. Then we need two more letters: ""OESIC"" (invalid), ""OESUM"" (invalid), ""OESTE"" (invalid).

Let me step back and think of valid 5-letter words that contain O, S, E but not A or R. 

Possible words:
- NOSES: but S is in position 4, which was S’s original position - invalid (S was in position 4 originally, so it cannot be in position 4 again).
- POSED: D is new, but O is in position 2 (original was position 3 - allowed), S in position 3 (original was 4 - allowed), E in position 5 (original was 5 - invalid, E cannot be in position 5).
- DOSES: O in position 2, S in position 3 and 5, E in position 4 - but S cannot be in position 4 (it’s in 3 and 5 here, so position 4 is E which is allowed), but we have two S's which might not be the case.
- LOSES: L, O, S, E, S - again double S, and E is in position 5 (invalid).
- MOUSE: M, O, U, S, E - O in position 2, U is new, S in 4 (invalid, was originally 4), E in 5 (invalid).
- HOSES: H, O, S, E, S - double S, E in 5 (invalid).
- NOSEY: N, O, S, E, Y - O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, Y is new. This seems valid - no A or R, O not in 3, S not in 4, E not in 5.

Thus, ""NOSEY"" seems like a good next guess.

<guess>NOSEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOSEY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
   - A and R are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the secret word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5.

2. NOSEY → N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)
   - N and Y are excluded.
   - O, S, E are in the word again, but this time each is in the wrong position (they each got “-”).

Combining the two:
- O, S, E must all appear somewhere in the word, but
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 2 (from NOSEY).
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 3 (from NOSEY).
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) AND cannot be in position 4 (from NOSEY).

So the only possible positions left are:
  O: 1, 4, 5   (but not 2 or 3)
  S: 1, 2, 5   (but not 3 or 4)
  E: 1, 2, 3   (but not 4 or 5)

Also, we have not yet used the letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. We need two more distinct, as-yet-unused letters to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s place the known letters first and then pick two new ones.

Option 1: Put O in 1, S in 2, E in 3 → O S E _ _
   Need two new consonants.  Good choices that make a real word: “O” + “S” + “E” + “L” + “D” → O S E L D → “O S E L D” is not a recognized 5-letter word.  
   “O S E L” + “M” → “OSELM” – no.

Option 2: Put S in 1, E in 2, O in 4 → S E _ O _
   Need two new consonants.  A common 5-letter word fitting is S E T O N (“seton” – surgical thread).  That uses T (new) and N (ruled out already), so invalid.

Option 3: Put E in 1, S in 2, O in 5 → E S _ _ O
   Need two new consonants.  A valid word: E S C O T → but that repeats O.  Actually ESCEO, ESBRO, ESPOO – nothing obvious.

Option 4: Put E in 1, O in 4, S in 5 → E _ _ O S
   Need two middle letters.  Real word: E L B O S – no; E L M O S – no; E L V O S – no.  
   “E V O K S” – no.

Option 5: Put S in 1, O in 4, E in 2 → S E _ O _
   Real word: S E C O N – no; S E D O N – no; S E M O N – no.

Option 6: Put S in 1, O in 5, E in 3 → S _ E _ O
   Real word: S P E E D – E is in 3, good, but D is new, P is new; let’s check letters: S, P, E, E, O – double E is possible.  “SPEED” is a valid 5-letter word.  
   Check constraints:
      – Contains S, E, O.
      – Positions: S=1 (allowed), P=new, E=3 (allowed), E=4 (but E cannot be in 4) – fails.

Option 7: Put O in 1, S in 5, E in 3 → O _ E _ S
   Real word: O B E Y S – Y already ruled out.  
   O V E R S – R already ruled out.  
   O P E N S – N already ruled out.  
   O L E G S – G is new, L is new.  “OLEGS” – plural of oleg?  Not standard.  
   But “OLEGS” is not recognized.  “OBEYS” invalid due to Y.

Option 8: Put O in 4, S in 1, E in 2 → S E _ O _
   Same as option 2.

Option 9: Put O in 4, S in 5, E in 1 → E _ _ O S
   Real word: E C H O S – E=1, C=new, H=new, O=4, S=5.  Letters used: E, C, H, O, S.
   Check constraints:
      – No A, R, N, Y.
      – O is in position 4 (allowed: not 2 or 3).
      – S is in position 5 (allowed: not 3 or 4).
      – E is in position 1 (allowed: not 4 or 5).
   “ECHOS” is a standard English word.

So the best next guess is ECHOS.

<guess>ECHOS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOSEY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: ECHOS -> FEEDBACK: E(-) C(-) H(x) O(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me tabulate the constraints so far.

Letters we know are in the target word: O, S, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the target word: A, R, N, Y, H  
Letters we have not tried yet (but may or may not be in the word): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Position constraints for O, S, E

- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from NOSEY, AROSE, ECHOS feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for O: 1 or 5.

- S cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 (from NOSEY, AROSE, ECHOS feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for S: 1 or 2.

- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from ECHOS, AROSE, NOSEY feedback).  
  Remaining possible positions for E: 2 or 3.

So we must place:
- O in 1 or 5  
- S in 1 or 2  
- E in 2 or 3  

In addition we need two more distinct letters chosen from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z}.

Let me enumerate the viable arrangements.

Case 1: O in position 1  
 Case 1a: S in position 2  
  Then E must be in position 3  
  Word so far: O S E _ _  
  We need two new consonants for positions 4 and 5, avoiding all letters already ruled out.  
  Plausible real words:  
  - O S E L D → “OSLED” (valid: past tense of ose)  
  - O S E L M → “OSELM” (not a word)  
  - O S E B D → “OSEBD” (invalid)  
  - O S E T T → invalid  
  “OSLED” is the only recognizable candidate here.

 Case 1b: S in position 1  
  But O is already in position 1 → impossible.

Case 2: O in position 5  
 Case 2a: S in position 1  
  E must be in position 2 or 3  
  2a-i: E in position 2 → S E _ _ O  
   Need two new consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
   Real word: S E P T O → “SEPTO” (a rare combining form) – still valid; letters S,E,P,T,O are all allowed so far.  
  2a-ii: E in position 3 → S _ E _ O  
   Real word: S P E W O → “SPEWO” (slang) – non-standard.  
   Real word: S L E D O → “SLEDO” – non-standard.  
   Real word: S W E D O – no.  
   Not very promising.

 Case 2b: S in position 2  
  Then E must be in position 3  
  Word so far: _ S E _ O  
  Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4.  
  Real words:  
  - B S E C O → “BSECO” (invalid)  
  - D S E T O → “DSETO” (invalid)  
  - L S E T O → “LSETO” (invalid)  
  - B S E T O → “BSETO” (invalid)  
  No common English word seems to fit.

Among all these, the clearest legitimate word is “OSLED” (from Case 1a).  
It satisfies every constraint:
- Contains O, S, E exactly once each.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters A, R, N, Y, H are absent.
- Uses two new consonants L and D.

Therefore the next guess is OSLED.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOSEY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(-) Y(x)

Guess 4: OSLED -> FEEDBACK: O(-) S(-) L(-) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word: O, S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, N, Y, H, D, C, L  
Still-unused/allowed letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Position constraints:

O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 1.  
S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 1.  
E cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → therefore MUST be in position 2.

But both O and S are required to be in position 1, which is impossible in a single 5-letter word.

This contradiction tells us that the earlier assumption of only O, S, E being present must be wrong; one of them must appear twice, or another letter must also be in the word.  However, the feedback has consistently marked each of O, S, E with “-” (present but wrong place) and never “✓”, so each of them must appear exactly once (Wordle / standard rules: a letter only gets one mark per guess).

Since the constraints now lead to a logical impossibility, the only way forward is to backtrack and conclude that our earlier candidate “OSLED” must have mis-positioned the required letters.  Rechecking, we see that the feedback for OSLED gave “-” for every one of O, S, L, E, which confirmed none of them were in their correct spots.  This actually tightens the positional bans further:

After OSLED feedback:
- O cannot be in position 1 → O must be in position 5 (only remaining slot).  
- S cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1 (only remaining slot).  
- E cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 2 (only remaining slot).

So the word must be:

Position 1: S  
Position 2: E  
Position 3: _  
Position 4: _  
Position 5: O  

We now need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 that are:
- Not in {A,R,N,Y,H,D,C,L}  
- Not duplicates of S, E, O.

Still-available letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E _ _ O.

Looking through Scrabble-valid English 5-letter words that fit S E ?? O:

- S E B O O – invalid (double O)  
- S E M P O – invalid  
- S E T O N – but N is banned  
- S E T T O – but T T duplicates, and T is allowed  
- S E T T O – actually “setto” is archaic but valid.  
- S E R V O – R banned  
- S E G U O – no  
- S E G N O – no  
- S E G O ? – no  
- S E P T O – “septo” (prefix) valid  

The cleanest valid word is “SEBRO” but R is banned.  “SEPTO” is valid (as septo-, combining form).  It uses S, E, P, T, O with P and T both allowed.  It fits every constraint.

Therefore the next guess is SEPTO.After carefully re-computing all constraints, the only remaining valid word pattern is S E _ _ O with two new consonants in positions 3-4. The valid English word that fits is:

After the fifth guess (SEPTO) we received:
S(-) E(-) P(x) T(x) O(-)

Key take-aways:
1. The secret word still contains S, E, O (each marked “-”).
2. P and T are NOT in the word at all.
3. The positions that are now ruled out for each required letter are:

   S cannot be in positions: 4 (from AROSE), 3 (NOSEY), 2 (ECHOS), 1 (SEPTO), 5 (SEPTO).  
   → Every position is ruled out → contradiction.

This contradiction can only arise if one of the required letters actually appears twice in the secret word, because the “-” symbol in these rules is only applied once per letter per guess (standard Wordle behaviour).  
Therefore the secret word must contain at least two copies of one of the letters {S, E, O}.

Let’s re-state the minimal set of letters that must appear:
- At least one S, one E, one O, and possibly duplicates.

Re-compute position bans with duplicates allowed:

For S:
- banned positions: 4 (AROSE), 3 (NOSEY), 2 (ECHOS), 1 (SEPTO), 5 (SEPTO)
  → every single position is banned → impossible unless there is a second S.

Same reasoning for E and O: every position is now banned for at least one of them.

Hence, exactly one of S/E/O must appear twice.

Let’s enumerate the only viable pattern that satisfies the feedback:

We need exactly five slots with:
- S once or twice,
- E once or twice,
- O once or twice,
- no P or T,
- all other letters from the still-allowed set {B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}.

After exhaustive elimination, the only arrangement that satisfies every positional ban is:
  S in position 2, E in position 3, O in position 4, plus two new consonants in positions 1 and 5.

A legitimate English word matching that skeleton is:
  B E S O M  (besom – a bundle of twigs used as a broom)

Check:
- Contains S, E, O exactly once each (meets the “-” requirement).  
- B and M are still allowed.  
- Positions: S not in 4, E not in 5, O not in 3, and none of the banned letters appear.  

Therefore “BESOM” satisfies every constraint.
