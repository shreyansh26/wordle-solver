For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good candidates include words like:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, I'll go with STARE because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It has S and T which are extremely common starting letters
3. R is also very common in 5-letter words
4. It gives good coverage across the alphabet

The feedback from STARE shows:
- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- T, A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the word starts with S, and from the eliminated letters, we know it does NOT contain T, A, R, E. 

Next, I need a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Does NOT use T, A, R, E
3. Uses other common consonants/vowels

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to maximize information. Some candidates:
- SPOIL (but has O and I, which are good, but also L - need to check if L is allowed)
- SOUND (but has U and N and D, but O is a vowel)
- SLINK (but L and N and K are good)
- SNICK (but C and K and N are good)
- SHOWN (but H, O, W, N are good)

I think SOUND is good - uses O (vowel), U (vowel), N, D.
SHOWN is also good - uses H, O, W, N.

Between these, SOUND seems better because it tests two new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (N, D).

Another option would be SPOON but that repeats O, which isn't optimal for info.

Let's go with SOUND.

Wait, let me check: SOUND has letters S, O, U, N, D - none of the eliminated letters (T,A,R,E) are used, and it starts with S which we know is correct.

Actually, let's try SPOIL - it uses P, O, I, L which are all new letters.
But SOUND is more common...

I think SOUND is the better choice here.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only I (since A, E, O, U are all out)

Therefore the four remaining letters must come from the non-forbidden set and must include at least one I (the only vowel left). Ideally we pick common letters to maximize information.

Candidate patterns: S _ _ _ I or S _ I _ _ or etc.  
Good consonants to test: B, C, K, L, M, P, S (already used), W, Y

Possible valid words:
- SWIM?  → W and M are allowed, but we only have one I, and that’s fine.  
- SKIP   → K and P allowed.  
- SICK   → C and K allowed.  
- SMITH  → contains T (forbidden) → discard.  
- SLICK  → contains L and C, K.

   ⇒ the word also does NOT contain O, U, N, D.

So we know:
- First letter is S
- Forbidden letters so far: T, A, R, E, O, U, N, D

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only I (since A, E, O, U are all out)

Therefore the four remaining letters must come from the non-forbidden set and must include at least one I (the only vowel left). Ideally we pick common letters to maximize information.

Candidate patterns: S _ _ _ I or S _ I _ _ or etc.  
Good consonants to test: B, C, K, L, M, P, S (already used), W, Y

Possible valid words:
- SWIM?  → W and M are allowed, but we only have one I, and that’s fine.  
- SKIP   → K and P allowed.  
- SICK   → C and K allowed.  
- SMITH  → contains T (forbidden) → discard.  
- SLICK  → contains L and C, K.  
- SCAMP  → M and P allowed.

Among these, SLICK uses three new consonants (L, I, C, K) and the only remaining vowel I. It’s also a common word.

Therefore SLICK is the best next guess.

Summary of all feedback:

1. STARE → S✓ (position 1), T x, A x, R x, E x  
2. SOUND → S✓, O x, U x, N x, D x  
3. SLICK → S✓, L- (letter L is somewhere but not in position 2), I✓ (correct in position 3), C x, K- (letter K is somewhere but not in position 5)

Deduced constraints:
- First letter: S
- Third letter: I
- Letters not present: T, A, R, E, O, U, N, D, C
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, K
- Letters that may appear: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We now need a 5-letter word matching pattern:

S _ I _ _   (first and third positions fixed)

and containing both L and K in the remaining two slots (positions 2,4,5), but:
- L cannot be in position 2 (from SLICK feedback)
- K cannot be in position 5 (from SLICK feedback)

Possible placements:
- K must go in position 2 or 4
- L must go in position 4 or 5

Let’s list the two viable cases:

Case 1: K in position 2 → S K I _ _
   Then L must fit in position 4 or 5, but cannot be in position 2 (already K) and not in position 5 because we have K- implying K is not in 5th but could be in 4th. So word would be S K I L _ . But then position 5 must be one of the allowed letters. However we know K is already placed, and L is only needed once. So SKIL_ . Possible endings: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. The only common word is SKILL, but L would be repeated and we only need one L. So SKILL is possible.

Case 2: K in position 4 → S _ I K _
   Then L must fit in position 2 or 5, but cannot be in position 2 because in SLICK L was not in position 2 (it was in position 2 but marked as - meaning wrong position). So L must be in position 5. Word would be S _ I K L. The only common word is SPIKL? No dictionary word. So impossible. Similarly SMIKL, SKIKL, etc. do not exist.

Case 3: K in position 2, L in position 4: SKIL_
   SKILL is the only candidate.

Case 4: K in position 2, L in position 5: SKI L cannot fit because we need 5 letters.

Hence the only valid candidate is SKILL.
