For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I, D. A good first word should have 5 unique letters from these common ones. Some good candidates are: ARISE, ROATE, RAISE, SLATE, STARE, CRANE. I'll choose ""arise"" because it has A, R, I, S, E which are all very common letters in English words.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- E is correct in position 5.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- E in position 5.
- an A somewhere in positions 1-4 (not position 1 because A was in position 1 in the guess and marked “-” for wrong position).
- no R, I, or S.

Good letters already known: A, E  
Bad letters: R, I, S

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, P, B  
Common vowels (apart from A and E): O, U

I need a word with:
- E in position 5
- A somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
- no R, I, S

Candidate words: “table”, “cable”, “gated”, “dated”, “navel”, “panel”, “camel”, “angel”, “fable”, “hazel”.
I’ll pick “table” because T, B, L are all common and it places A in position 2.

What we know:

1. Last letter is E (✓ both times).  
2. A is in the word and now locked in position 2 (✓ in table).  
   So the pattern is _ A _ _ E.  
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, B.  
4. Letters that exist but are misplaced: T and L have been seen in wrong positions (T at 1, L at 4).

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:  
C, D, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, Y.

We need a word of the form _ A _ _ E, avoiding R, I, S, B and without repeating T or L in their disallowed positions (but T or L could appear in other positions).

Candidate words:  
- CAME (but need 5 letters) → CAMEL clashes L at 4 (already ruled out).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Some good candidates are: ARISE, ROATE, RAISE, SLATE, STARE, CRANE. I'll choose ""arise"" because it has A, R, I, S, E which are all very common letters in English words.

- E is correct in position 5.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- E in position 5.
- an A somewhere in positions 1-4 (not position 1 because A was in position 1 in the guess and marked “-” for wrong position).
- no R, I, or S.

Good letters already known: A, E  
Bad letters: R, I, S

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, P, B  
Common vowels (apart from A and E): O, U

I need a word with:
- E in position 5
- A somewhere in positions 2,3, or 4
- no R, I, S

Candidate words: “table”, “cable”, “gated”, “dated”, “navel”, “panel”, “camel”, “angel”, “fable”, “hazel”.
I’ll pick “table” because T, B, L are all common and it places A in position 2.

What we know:

1. Last letter is E (✓ both times).  
2. A is in the word and now locked in position 2 (✓ in table).  
   So the pattern is _ A _ _ E.  
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, B.  
4. Letters that exist but are misplaced: T and L have been seen in wrong positions (T at 1, L at 4).

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:  
C, D, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, Y.

We need a word of the form _ A _ _ E, avoiding R, I, S, B and without repeating T or L in their disallowed positions (but T or L could appear in other positions).

Candidate words:  
- CAME (but need 5 letters) → CAMEL clashes L at 4 (already ruled out).  
- DANCE – N at 3, C at 4, D at 1 → D A N C E → positions: D(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5).

Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: dance -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) N(x) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Known facts:
1. Pattern: _ A _ _ E   (A locked at 2, E locked at 5)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, I, S, B, D, N, C, T (from their “x” marks)
3. Letters still possible: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any reused letters but all common ones are ruled out or misplaced)

We need a 5-letter word matching _ A _ _ E using only the allowed letters (avoiding the excluded set).

Simple candidates:
- F A _ _ E → FABLE (B is already excluded)
- H A _ _ E → HAZEL (Z okay, L already appeared as misplaced but not excluded, so L could appear in another position)
- L A _ _ E → LADLE (D excluded)
- M A _ _ E → MAPLE (P okay, L could be in position 4)
- G A _ _ E → GABLE (B excluded)
- P A _ _ E → PANEL (N excluded)

MAPLE fits: M(1) A(2) P(3) L(4) E(5)  
– M, P, L not yet excluded.  
– No R, I, S, B, D, N, C, T used.  

So MAPLE is a safe next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:

1. Pattern: _ A _ _ E   (A is fixed at position 2, E at position 5)
2. Letters already ruled out entirely: R, I, S, B, D, N, C, T, M, P
3. Letters that are in the word but not yet placed: L (because it got “-” in position 4, so it must appear somewhere else in the word)
4. Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 3
   - Position 1: cannot be any of the excluded letters above
   - Position 3: cannot be any of the excluded letters above, and must include L somewhere (since L must be in the word once)

Allowed letters (common ones) that have not been ruled out: F, G, H, J, K, O, U, V, W, Y, Z (and L).

L must appear once in the word, and it cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ E with L placed once in position 1 or 3 and no excluded letters:

- L A _ _ E → L(1) A(2) _ _ E → candidate: LANCE (N excluded), LADLE (D excluded), LAPSE (P excluded) – none work.
- _ A L _ E → H A L V E (V okay, H okay) – HALVE
- _ A _ L E → but position 5 is E, so _ A _ L E would need 4th letter L, but L already ruled out for position 4 from feedback.

Thus, the only viable candidate fitting all constraints is HALVE.
Check letters: H, A, L, V, E
- H, V not yet tested, not excluded
- L must appear (and is in position 3, which is allowed)
- No excluded letters used

From the five previous guesses we now know:

1. Pattern: _ A _ _ E   (A fixed in position 2, E fixed in position 5)
2. Letters that must appear once: L (because it has been marked “-” twice, so it is in the word but has not yet been placed correctly).
3. Letters that have been ruled out entirely:
   R, I, S, B, D, N, C, T, M, P, H, V
4. Therefore the only letters still available for positions 1 and 3 are:
   F, G, J, K, O, U, W, Y, Z   plus the letter L which must be used exactly once.

Since L must be used once and may not appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (already occupied or ruled out), the only possible slots for L are positions 1 or 3.

Let us list the valid combinations:

- L A _ _ E  → needs a third letter (position 3) from the remaining pool.
  Possible third letters: F, G, J, K, O, U, W, Y, Z
  Example: L A F _ E → LAF_E → valid 5-letter word: LAF?E – none common.

- _ A L _ E → positions 1 and 3: choose a consonant for position 1 from the pool, and place L at 3.
  Candidates: G A L _ E, F A L _ E, K A L _ E, etc.
  Valid English word: GAL *E → GALOE? No.
  F A L _ E → FALOE? No.
  K A L _ E → KAL?E → Kales? No 5-letter common word.

- _ A _ L E → impossible, because position 4 is already ruled out for L (feedback from table and halve).

Re-examine the list of 5-letter English words ending in “ALE” or fitting _ A _ _ E with the remaining letters.

After filtering, the only remaining plausible candidate is:

G A U Z E → but Z and G are still allowed; let’s check positions:
G (1) A (2) U (3) Z (4) E (5)
- All letters except the known excluded set.
- L has to appear once, but G A U Z E doesn’t contain L → invalid.

We must use L exactly once. The only remaining pattern that works is:

F A L L E → but has two L’s → invalid because L must appear only once.

J A L E _ → need ending E → J A L E E (invalid, double E).

Wait, let’s list remaining consonants that can start the word and still allow a valid word.

Remaining consonants for position 1: F, G, K, W, Y
Remaining for position 3 (where L could go): L

So the word must be:
[ F, G, K, W, Y ]  A  L  ?  E

Only letter left for position 4: from remaining pool (after excluding everything ruled out). We have not yet used: F, G, K, W, Y, O, U, J, Z.

But position 4 letter must be a single consonant followed by E forming a valid ending. The only valid 5-letter English word fitting this is:

F A L K E → F A L K E (F, A, L, K, E)

Check:
- F, A, L, K, E – none have been ruled out (K and F are still allowed).
- Contains L in position 3 (allowed).
- Matches pattern _ A _ _ E.
- No excluded letters.

Hence, F A L K E is the logical next guess.
