For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently used letters in the English language. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (uses R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (a very common vowel)
- N and E (also common consonant and vowel)

This word balances vowel and consonant coverage without repeating letters, making it an efficient first guess to gather information about letter presence and positions.

- A has now been tried in positions 2 and 3 (PLATE and GLOAT) and both times was marked “-” (exists but wrong spot). So A cannot be at 2 or 3. It also cannot be at 3 (per GLOAT) or 5 (E). Therefore A must be at position 1.  
- L has been tried at positions 2 and 3 and both were “-”. So L is in the word but not in spots 2 or 3. It also can’t be 4 (T) or 5 (E), so L must be at position 1.

But A must be at position 1 and L must be at position 1 – impossible. This indicates an inconsistency or misinterpretation.

Let me re-parse:

From PLATE: T(✓) at 4, E(✓) at 5 – so pattern _ _ _ T E.  
From GLOAT again: T at 4 was marked ✓, so GLOAT feedback is G(x) L(-) O(x) A(-) T(-). But T at 4 is ✓ in PLATE, so the “T(-)” in GLOAT is actually T at 4 again (✓), but feedback says “T(-)” meaning T is in word but position is wrong – that contradicts PLATE’s T(✓). Therefore the GLOAT feedback must be read letter-by-letter: G(x), L(-), O(x), A(-), T(-) each at their respective positions in GLOAT.

Wait, the feedback format is per letter in the guess, not absolute position. So:

Guess 3 G L O A T  
Feedback: G(x) L(-) O(x) A(-) T(-)

This means:
- G not in word.
- L is in word but not at position 2.
- O not in word.
- A is in word but not at position 4.
- T is in word but not at position 5.

But from PLATE (P L A T E) we had T(✓) at 4, so T is in position 4. The GLOAT feedback says T(-) at position 5 – that just confirms T is not at 5, which is consistent with T at 4.

So current facts:
- Pattern must be _ _ _ T E (from PLATE’s T(✓) and E(✓))
- A is in word, not at 3 (CRANE), not at 4 (PLATE), not at 4 again (GLOAT) – so A must be at 1 or 2.
- L is in word, not at 2 (PLATE), not at 2 (GLOAT) – so L must be at 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, P, G, O.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ T E, containing A and L, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible positions:
- If A is at 1: A _ _ T E, with L at 3: A _ L T E  
- If A is at 2: _ A _ T E, with L at 1 or 3:
  - L A _ T E – but L at 1 is allowed
  - _ A L T E – but L at 3 is allowed

Let’s list candidate words:
- A _ L T E: ALITE, ALATE – but ALITE has I/E, etc. Valid word might be ALATE but A is duplicated.
- _ A L T E: BALTE? DALTE? No. Valid English words: HALTE is not common, VALET – V, A, L, E, T – but T is at 4 and E at 5, so V A L T E – VALET is valid.

Check VALET:
- V: new letter
- A at 2: allowed
- L at 3: allowed
- T at 4: correct
- E at 5: correct
Letters not forbidden.

So VALET is a good next guess.

- A and L are in the word but their positions are still unknown.

Other constraints:
- A has now been tried in positions 2 and 3 (PLATE and GLOAT) and both times was marked “-” (exists but wrong spot). So A cannot be at 2 or 3. It also cannot be at 3 (per GLOAT) or 5 (E). Therefore A must be at position 1.

Wait, the feedback format is per letter in the guess, not absolute position. So:

This means:

But from PLATE (P L A T E) we had T(✓) at 4, so T is in position 4. The GLOAT feedback says T(-) at position 5 – that just confirms T is not at 5, which is consistent with T at 4.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LATTE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently used letters in the English language. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (uses R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (a very common vowel)
- N and E (also common consonant and vowel)

This word balances vowel and consonant coverage without repeating letters, making it an efficient first guess to gather information about letter presence and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

So we now know:  
- The word ends in E.  
- A appears somewhere else (possible positions 1, 2, 4).  
- No C, R, N.

Next, we want a word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.  
- Places A in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 4).  
- Uses new letters (no repeats of C, R, N).  

A good candidate is ""PLATE"":
P, L, T are new consonants; A is in position 2 (allowed); E is fixed at 5.

<guess>PLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, P  
- Letters confirmed in the word (but positions still being pinned down):  
  – E in position 5 (✓)  
  – A is somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4 because it’s been marked “wrong position” twice)  
  – T in position 4 (✓)  
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 2.

So the pattern looks like:  
_ _ _ T E with A and L also appearing somewhere, and no C/R/N/P.

Plausible remaining positions for A: 1, 2 (cannot be 4 because T is there).  
Plausible positions for L: 1, 2, 3 (but not 2 if we avoid repeating its “wrong position” from PLATE).

A five-letter word satisfying these constraints is “GLOAT”:  
- G, O are new test letters.  
- L is tested in position 3 (still possible).  
- A is tested in position 2 (still possible).  
- T and E are placed correctly.

This keeps all previously learned constraints while introducing fresh consonants G and O to maximize information gain.

- L is in word, not at 2 (PLATE), not at 2 (GLOAT) – so L must be at 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, P, G, O.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ T E, containing A and L, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible positions:

Let's extract the exact constraints from all feedback so far.

Guesses and their exact feedback (position-by-position):

1. CRANE  
   C₍₁₎=x, R₍₂₎=x, A₍₃₎=-, N₍₄₎=x, E₍₅₎=✓

2. PLATE  
   P₍₁₎=x, L₍₂₎=-, A₍₃₎=-, T₍₄₎=✓, E₍₅₎=✓

3. GLOAT  
   G₍₁₎=x, L₍₂₎=-, O₍₃₎=x, A₍₄₎=-, T₍₅₎=-

4. VALET  
   V₍₁₎=x, A₍₂₎=✓, L₍₃₎=-, E₍₄₎=-, T₍₅₎=-

From these four turns we now know:

Letters NOT present anywhere: C, R, N, P, G, O, V.

Letters confirmed present:
- E must be in the word (because E₍₅₎=✓ in CRANE and PLATE).
- A must be in the word (because A appears with “-” in CRANE, PLATE, GLOAT, and finally A₍₂₎=✓ in VALET).
- L must be in the word (because L appears with “-” in PLATE, GLOAT, and VALET).
- T must be in the word (because T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE).

Positions so far locked in:
5 → E (from CRANE and PLATE)

Positions so far locked out:
- A cannot be at 3 (CRANE), 3 (PLATE), 4 (GLOAT). VALET places A at 2 and gets ✓, so A is at 2.
- L cannot be at 2 (PLATE), 2 (GLOAT), 3 (VALET).
- T cannot be at 5 (GLOAT). But T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE, so T is fixed at 4.

Current pattern:
_ A _ T E

Letters still to place: L (must go in position 1 or 3, but not 3 from VALET feedback).  
Therefore L must be at position 1.

So the only remaining unknown is position 3.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form L A _ T E with position 3 filled by a letter that
- has not been used (not among C,R,N,P,G,O,V) and
- has not been ruled out.

Available letters (unused so far and not ruled out):  
B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for “LA _ TE” forms, the only common English 5-letter word is “LATEX”.  
Check its letters: L, A, T, E, X — none are ruled out.  
“LATEX” exactly matches _ A _ T E with L at 1, A at 2, T at 4, E at 5, and X at 3.

Therefore the next logical guess is LATEX.

   V₍₁₎=x, A₍₂₎=✓, L₍₃₎=-, E₍₄₎=-, T₍₅₎=-

From these four turns we now know:

Letters NOT present anywhere: C, R, N, P, G, O, V.

Letters confirmed present:
- E must be in the word (because E₍₅₎=✓ in CRANE and PLATE).
- A must be in the word (because A appears with “-” in CRANE, PLATE, GLOAT, and finally A₍₂₎=✓ in VALET).
- L must be in the word (because L appears with “-” in PLATE, GLOAT, and VALET).
- T must be in the word (because T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE).

Positions so far locked in:
5 → E (from CRANE and PLATE)

Positions so far locked out:
- A cannot be at 3 (CRANE), 3 (PLATE), 4 (GLOAT). VALET places A at 2 and gets ✓, so A is at 2.
- L cannot be at 2 (PLATE), 2 (GLOAT), 3 (VALET).
- T cannot be at 5 (GLOAT). But T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE, so T is fixed at 4.

Current pattern:
_ A _ T E

Letters still to place: L (must go in position 1 or 3, but not 3 from VALET feedback).  
Therefore L must be at position 1.

So the only remaining unknown is position 3.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form L A _ T E with position 3 filled by a letter that
- has not been used (not among C,R,N,P,G,O,V) and
- has not been ruled out.

Available letters (unused so far and not ruled out):  
B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for “LA _ TE” forms, the only common English 5-letter word is “LATEX”.  
Check its letters: L, A, T, E, X — none are ruled out.  
“LATEX” exactly matches _ A _ T E with L at 1, A at 2, T at 4, E at 5, and X at 3.

Therefore the next logical guess is LATEX.",Guess 5: LATEX -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(-) X(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible by testing frequently used letters in the English language. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (uses R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (a very common vowel)
- N and E (also common consonant and vowel)

This word balances vowel and consonant coverage without repeating letters, making it an efficient first guess to gather information about letter presence and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

So we now know:  
- The word ends in E.  
- A appears somewhere else (possible positions 1, 2, 4).  
- No C, R, N.

Next, we want a word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.  
- Places A in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 4).  
- Uses new letters (no repeats of C, R, N).  

A good candidate is ""PLATE"":
P, L, T are new consonants; A is in position 2 (allowed); E is fixed at 5.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, P  
- Letters confirmed in the word (but positions still being pinned down):  
  – E in position 5 (✓)  
  – A is somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4 because it’s been marked “wrong position” twice)  
  – T in position 4 (✓)  
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 2.

So the pattern looks like:  
_ _ _ T E with A and L also appearing somewhere, and no C/R/N/P.

Plausible remaining positions for A: 1, 2 (cannot be 4 because T is there).  
Plausible positions for L: 1, 2, 3 (but not 2 if we avoid repeating its “wrong position” from PLATE).

A five-letter word satisfying these constraints is “GLOAT”:  
- G, O are new test letters.  
- L is tested in position 3 (still possible).  
- A is tested in position 2 (still possible).  
- T and E are placed correctly.

This keeps all previously learned constraints while introducing fresh consonants G and O to maximize information gain.

Guess 3: GLOAT -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(x) A(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far:

Letters **not** in the word: C, R, N, P, G, O  
Known letters **in** the word:  
- E in position 5 (✓)  
- T somewhere (but PLATE had T in 4 and it was ✓, so T is in 4) – wait, PLATE had T(✓) at spot 4, so T is fixed at 4.  
- A and L are in the word but their positions are still unknown.

Other constraints:
- A has now been tried in positions 2 and 3 (PLATE and GLOAT) and both times was marked “-” (exists but wrong spot). So A cannot be at 2 or 3. It also cannot be at 3 (per GLOAT) or 5 (E). Therefore A must be at position 1.  
- L has been tried at positions 2 and 3 and both were “-”. So L is in the word but not in spots 2 or 3. It also can’t be 4 (T) or 5 (E), so L must be at position 1.

But A must be at position 1 and L must be at position 1 – impossible. This indicates an inconsistency or misinterpretation.

Let me re-parse:

From PLATE: T(✓) at 4, E(✓) at 5 – so pattern _ _ _ T E.  
From GLOAT again: T at 4 was marked ✓, so GLOAT feedback is G(x) L(-) O(x) A(-) T(-). But T at 4 is ✓ in PLATE, so the “T(-)” in GLOAT is actually T at 4 again (✓), but feedback says “T(-)” meaning T is in word but position is wrong – that contradicts PLATE’s T(✓). Therefore the GLOAT feedback must be read letter-by-letter: G(x), L(-), O(x), A(-), T(-) each at their respective positions in GLOAT.

Wait, the feedback format is per letter in the guess, not absolute position. So:

Guess 3 G L O A T  
Feedback: G(x) L(-) O(x) A(-) T(-)

This means:
- G not in word.
- L is in word but not at position 2.
- O not in word.
- A is in word but not at position 4.
- T is in word but not at position 5.

But from PLATE (P L A T E) we had T(✓) at 4, so T is in position 4. The GLOAT feedback says T(-) at position 5 – that just confirms T is not at 5, which is consistent with T at 4.

So current facts:
- Pattern must be _ _ _ T E (from PLATE’s T(✓) and E(✓))
- A is in word, not at 3 (CRANE), not at 4 (PLATE), not at 4 again (GLOAT) – so A must be at 1 or 2.
- L is in word, not at 2 (PLATE), not at 2 (GLOAT) – so L must be at 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, P, G, O.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ T E, containing A and L, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible positions:
- If A is at 1: A _ _ T E, with L at 3: A _ L T E  
- If A is at 2: _ A _ T E, with L at 1 or 3:
  - L A _ T E – but L at 1 is allowed
  - _ A L T E – but L at 3 is allowed

Let’s list candidate words:
- A _ L T E: ALITE, ALATE – but ALITE has I/E, etc. Valid word might be ALATE but A is duplicated.
- _ A L T E: BALTE? DALTE? No. Valid English words: HALTE is not common, VALET – V, A, L, E, T – but T is at 4 and E at 5, so V A L T E – VALET is valid.

Check VALET:
- V: new letter
- A at 2: allowed
- L at 3: allowed
- T at 4: correct
- E at 5: correct
Letters not forbidden.

So VALET is a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's extract the exact constraints from all feedback so far.

Guesses and their exact feedback (position-by-position):

1. CRANE  
   C₍₁₎=x, R₍₂₎=x, A₍₃₎=-, N₍₄₎=x, E₍₅₎=✓

2. PLATE  
   P₍₁₎=x, L₍₂₎=-, A₍₃₎=-, T₍₄₎=✓, E₍₅₎=✓

3. GLOAT  
   G₍₁₎=x, L₍₂₎=-, O₍₃₎=x, A₍₄₎=-, T₍₅₎=-

4. VALET  
   V₍₁₎=x, A₍₂₎=✓, L₍₃₎=-, E₍₄₎=-, T₍₅₎=-

From these four turns we now know:

Letters NOT present anywhere: C, R, N, P, G, O, V.

Letters confirmed present:
- E must be in the word (because E₍₅₎=✓ in CRANE and PLATE).
- A must be in the word (because A appears with “-” in CRANE, PLATE, GLOAT, and finally A₍₂₎=✓ in VALET).
- L must be in the word (because L appears with “-” in PLATE, GLOAT, and VALET).
- T must be in the word (because T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE).

Positions so far locked in:
5 → E (from CRANE and PLATE)

Positions so far locked out:
- A cannot be at 3 (CRANE), 3 (PLATE), 4 (GLOAT). VALET places A at 2 and gets ✓, so A is at 2.
- L cannot be at 2 (PLATE), 2 (GLOAT), 3 (VALET).
- T cannot be at 5 (GLOAT). But T₍₄₎=✓ in PLATE, so T is fixed at 4.

Current pattern:
_ A _ T E

Letters still to place: L (must go in position 1 or 3, but not 3 from VALET feedback).  
Therefore L must be at position 1.

So the only remaining unknown is position 3.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form L A _ T E with position 3 filled by a letter that
- has not been used (not among C,R,N,P,G,O,V) and
- has not been ruled out.

Available letters (unused so far and not ruled out):  
B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for “LA _ TE” forms, the only common English 5-letter word is “LATEX”.  
Check its letters: L, A, T, E, X — none are ruled out.  
“LATEX” exactly matches _ A _ T E with L at 1, A at 2, T at 4, E at 5, and X at 3.

Therefore the next logical guess is LATEX.

Current locked-in information after 5 guesses:

- Pattern so far: L A T E _  (positions 1-4 are L, A, T, E respectively)
- Letter at position 5 must be E (from CRANE and PLATE), but LATEX feedback shows E(-) at position 4, which is a contradiction with earlier. Re-examining:
  - CRANE: E✓ at position 5
  - PLATE: E✓ at position 5
  - Therefore E must be at position 5, but LATEX has E at position 4 and gets E(-), meaning E is not at position 4. This is consistent - E is at position 5.

Correct pattern is: L A T _ E (positions 1,2,3,5 known; only position 4 unknown).

Letters already used/ruled out: C,R,N,P,G,O,V,X plus L,A,T,E are confirmed present.

<guess>LATHE</guess>",LATHE,"Current locked-in information after 5 guesses:

- Pattern so far: L A T E _  (positions 1-4 are L, A, T, E respectively)
- Letter at position 5 must be E (from CRANE and PLATE), but LATEX feedback shows E(-) at position 4, which is a contradiction with earlier. Re-examining:
  - CRANE: E✓ at position 5
  - PLATE: E✓ at position 5
  - Therefore E must be at position 5, but LATEX has E at position 4 and gets E(-), meaning E is not at position 4. This is consistent - E is at position 5.

Correct pattern is: L A T _ E (positions 1,2,3,5 known; only position 4 unknown).

Letters already used/ruled out: C,R,N,P,G,O,V,X plus L,A,T,E are confirmed present.

Available letters for position 4 (must not be any of the 7 ruled-out consonants or the 4 confirmed letters): B,D,F,H,I,J,K,M,Q,S,U,W,Y,Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting L A T _ E:
- LATH E → ""LATHE"" (H is available)
- LATK E → ""LATKE"" (K is available)
- LATI E → no common word
- LATC E → no (C is ruled out)
- LATD E → no
- LATF E → no
- LATM E → no
- LATS E → ""LATES"" (S is available)

Best options are LATHE or LATKE. ""LATHE"" is more common.

Check LATHE:
