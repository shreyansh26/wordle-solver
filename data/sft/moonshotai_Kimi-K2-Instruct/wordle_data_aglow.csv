Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (R, A, I, S, E)
- All letters are among the top 10 most common letters
- The letters are spread across the alphabet, increasing chances of hitting correct letters

Feedback recap: RAISE  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2.  
I(x) – I is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

What we now know:
- The word has an A somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters to determine.

Good remaining common consonants: N, T, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: we’ve only placed A, so O and U are still possibilities.

We want a word that:
- Uses A in a new position (not position 2).
- Avoids R, I, S, E.
- Introduces several fresh consonants to narrow the pool.

A strong candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T are all new letters.
- A is not present, but that’s fine—our current information only guarantees A exists; we can probe other letters first.
However, let’s instead pick a word that definitely uses A in a new spot, and still introduces several fresh consonants.

Another strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are new.
- A appears in position 2 again → bad (feedback said A is in word but NOT in position 2).
So shift A to position 3: “CLAPT” – invalid (not common).
“PLANK” – A in position 3: valid; P, L, N, K all new.
But we still haven’t tested O or U. Let’s balance vowels and consonants.

Let’s use “MOUNT”:
- M, O, U, N, T: five new letters, no A used, but it lets us test O and U quickly.
However, we know A is somewhere, so we should probably keep A in the guess.

Try “PLANK”:
- A in position 3.
- P, L, N, K new.
- Meets all constraints.

2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still don’t know:
   - A (was in position 2 and 3, but feedback said “wrong position” both times) → A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - L (was in position 2, feedback said “wrong position”) → L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
3. Remaining unused common letters to test: T, D, B, C, G, M, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains both A and L (known to be in the word);
- Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3;
- Places L somewhere other than position 2;
- Avoids all the ruled-out letters R, I, S, E, P, N, K.

Candidate words:
- LADYB – invalid (not a common word).
- TALON – uses N (eliminated).
- DOULA – uses A in 4 and L in 3 → acceptable positions for both.
- GLOAM – uses M and G; A in 4, L in 2 → L in 2 was already rejected.
- VAULT – uses U, T, L in 3, A in 2 → A in 2 was rejected.
- COBALT – too long.
- GALAX – uses X (rare), but positions are good: A in 2 was rejected.

Best fit: DOULA
- 5 letters, common word.
- Contains A (position 4) and L (position 3), both in previously untested positions.
- Letters used: D, O, U, L, A – none of the rejected letters appear.

Let me extract the new information from Guess 3 (DOULA):

D(x) – D is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word, but not in position 2.  
U(x) – U is not in the word.  
L(-) – L is in the word, but not in position 4 (already knew it wasn’t in position 2).  
A(-) – A is in the word, but not in position 5 (already knew it wasn’t in positions 2 or 3).

So now we know the word must contain: A, L, O (each in still-unknown positions, but with certain exclusions).

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:  
R, I, S, E, P, N, K, D, U.

Remaining common letters to work with:  
B, C, F, G, H, J, M, T, V, W, Y, plus the required A, L, O.

Constraints on the three known letters (A, L, O):

- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 ⇒ A must be in position 1 or 4.  
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4 ⇒ L must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
- O cannot be in position 2 ⇒ O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that uses A, L, O plus two more unused letters (from the remaining pool), while honoring the positional restrictions.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. A _ _ _ _  
   - A at 1.  
   - L could be at 3 or 5.  
   - O could be at 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
   - Let’s try A L O _ _ – but “ALOFT” uses A 1, L 2 (invalid).  
   - How about A _ O L _ – word “ABOIL”? But I is eliminated.  
   - “ALLOY” – uses L twice, but second L would be at position 4 (invalid for L).  
   - “ALLOW” – same problem with second L.  
   - “ALONE” – E eliminated.  
   - “ALOHA” – H acceptable, but second A at 5 contradicts forbidden 5 for A.  
   - “ATOLL” – L at 4 (invalid).  
   - “ACOLY” – C, Y unused; A 1, C 2, O 3, L 4 (invalid for L).  
   - “AFLOAT” – too long.

2. _ _ _ A _  
   - A at 4.  
   - L can be at 1, 3, or 5.  
   - O can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
   - Try _ L O A _ – “BLOAT” – B, T unused; positions: B 1, L 2 (invalid for L).  
   - Try _ _ O A L – “COBAL” – no.  
   - Try _ _ L A _ – “GLOAT” – G, T unused; positions: G 1, L 2 (invalid).  
   - Try “LOCAL” – L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “FOCAL” – F, C unused; positions: F 1, O 2 (invalid for O).  
   - Try “GLOAM” – M unused; G 1, L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “CLOAK” – K eliminated.  
   - Try “FLOAT” – F 1, L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “MOLAR” – R eliminated.  
   - Try “HOAGY” – H, G, Y unused; positions: H 1, O 2 invalid.

3. Let’s look for words where A and L and O are all in allowed positions.

A must be 1 or 4.  
L must be 1, 3, or 5.  
O must be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct:

- A 1, O 3, L 5 → A _ O _ L  
  Valid English word: “APOOL” – no.  
  “ABOLL” – not standard.  
  “ACOOL” – double O, still not a word.  
  “ATOLL” – A 1, T 2, O 3, L 4 (L invalid).  

- A 1, L 3, O 4 → A _ L O _  
  “ALLOW” – O 4 is fine, but second L 4 invalid.  
  Not working.  

- A 4, L 1, O 3 → L _ O A _  
  “LOAT” – too short.  
  “LOATS” – S eliminated.  
  “LOBAR” – R eliminated.  

- A 4, L 3, O 5 → _ _ L A O  
  “CLAMO” – not standard.  
  “BLAMO” – not standard.  
  “FLAMO” – no.  

- A 4, L 5, O 3 → _ _ O A L  
  “GHOAL” – no.  
  “COBAL” – no.  
  “MOHAL” – no.  

Let me think differently: perhaps O is at position 1.

- O 1, A must be 4 (since A can’t be 5), and L must be 3 or 5.  
  - O _ L A _ – “OGLAM” – no.  
  - O _ _ A L – “OCTAL” – C, T unused; positions: O 1, C 2, T 3, A 4, L 5.  
    Check constraints:  
    – A is in word, and we place it at 4 (allowed).  
    – L is in word, we place it at 5 (allowed).  
    – O is in word, we place it at 1 (allowed).  
    – Letters used: O, C, T, A, L – none are in the banned set.  
    – “OCTAL” is a valid 5-letter English word.  

This satisfies every constraint derived so far.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (R, A, I, S, E)
- All letters are among the top 10 most common letters
- The letters are spread across the alphabet, increasing chances of hitting correct letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap: RAISE  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2.  
I(x) – I is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

What we now know:
- The word has an A somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters to determine.

Good remaining common consonants: N, T, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: we’ve only placed A, so O and U are still possibilities.

We want a word that:
- Uses A in a new position (not position 2).
- Avoids R, I, S, E.
- Introduces several fresh consonants to narrow the pool.

A strong candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T are all new letters.
- A is not present, but that’s fine—our current information only guarantees A exists; we can probe other letters first.
However, let’s instead pick a word that definitely uses A in a new spot, and still introduces several fresh consonants.

Another strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are new.
- A appears in position 2 again → bad (feedback said A is in word but NOT in position 2).
So shift A to position 3: “CLAPT” – invalid (not common).
“PLANK” – A in position 3: valid; P, L, N, K all new.
But we still haven’t tested O or U. Let’s balance vowels and consonants.

Let’s use “MOUNT”:
- M, O, U, N, T: five new letters, no A used, but it lets us test O and U quickly.
However, we know A is somewhere, so we should probably keep A in the guess.

Try “PLANK”:
- A in position 3.
- P, L, N, K new.
- Meets all constraints.

But “PLANK” is a good word; let’s go with it.

3. Remaining unused common letters to test: T, D, B, C, G, M, O, U, Y, etc.

   - “ALLOY” – uses L twice, but second L would be at position 4 (invalid for L).  
   - “ALLOW” – same problem with second L.  
   - “ALONE” – E eliminated.  
   - “ALOHA” – H acceptable, but second A at 5 contradicts forbidden 5 for A.  
   - “ATOLL” – L at 4 (invalid).  
   - “ACOLY” – C, Y unused; A 1, C 2, O 3, L 4 (invalid for L).  
   - “AFLOAT” – too long.

2. _ _ _ A _  
   - A at 4.  
   - L can be at 1, 3, or 5.  
   - O can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
   - Try _ L O A _ – “BLOAT” – B, T unused; positions: B 1, L 2 (invalid for L).  
   - Try _ _ O A L – “COBAL” – no.  
   - Try _ _ L A _ – “GLOAT” – G, T unused; positions: G 1, L 2 (invalid).  
   - Try “LOCAL” – L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “FOCAL” – F, C unused; positions: F 1, O 2 (invalid for O).  
   - Try “GLOAM” – M unused; G 1, L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “CLOAK” – K eliminated.  
   - Try “FLOAT” – F 1, L 2 invalid.  
   - Try “MOLAR” – R eliminated.  
   - Try “HOAGY” – H, G, Y unused; positions: H 1, O 2 invalid.

3. Let’s look for words where A and L and O are all in allowed positions.

A must be 1 or 4.  
L must be 1, 3, or 5.  
O must be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct:

- A 1, O 3, L 5 → A _ O _ L  
  Valid English word: “APOOL” – no.  
  “ABOLL” – not standard.  
  “ACOOL” – double O, still not a word.  
  “ATOLL” – A 1, T 2, O 3, L 4 (L invalid).  

- A 1, L 3, O 4 → A _ L O _  
  “ALLOW” – O 4 is fine, but second L 4 invalid.  
  Not working.  

- A 4, L 1, O 3 → L _ O A _  
  “LOAT” – too short.  
  “LOATS” – S eliminated.  
  “LOBAR” – R eliminated.  

- A 4, L 3, O 5 → _ _ L A O  
  “CLAMO” – not standard.  
  “BLAMO” – not standard.  
  “FLAMO” – no.  

- A 4, L 5, O 3 → _ _ O A L  
  “GHOAL” – no.  
  “COBAL” – no.  
  “MOHAL” – no.  

Let me think differently: perhaps O is at position 1.

- O 1, A must be 4 (since A can’t be 5), and L must be 3 or 5.  
  - O _ L A _ – “OGLAM” – no.  
  - O _ _ A L – “OCTAL” – C, T unused; positions: O 1, C 2, T 3, A 4, L 5.  
    Check constraints:  
    – A is in word, and we place it at 4 (allowed).  
    – L is in word, we place it at 5 (allowed).  
    – O is in word, we place it at 1 (allowed).  
    – Letters used: O, C, T, A, L – none are in the banned set.  
    – “OCTAL” is a valid 5-letter English word.  

This satisfies every constraint derived so far.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have PROVEN must appear in the word:
- A (from every guess so far)
- L (from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- O (from guesses 3, 4)

Letters we have PROVEN do NOT appear:
R, I, S, E, P, N, K, D, U, C, T

So the unknown letters must be chosen from the still-unused set:
B, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, Y (plus maybe others, but these are the common ones left).

Positional restrictions we still have:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5  ⇒  A must be in position 1 or 4.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4      ⇒  L must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2            ⇒  O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid English 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters A, L, O plus two **new** letters drawn only from the still-allowed set (B, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, Y).

Let’s enumerate the only remaining legal placements of A, L, O and see which produce a real word.

Case 1 – A in position 1
   A _ _ _ _
   - L must be 3 or 5
   - O must be 3, 4, or 5

        A B F O L – not a word.

        A F O G L – no.
   Sub-case C: A _ L O _  ⇒  need two consonants for positions 2 & 5.
        A B L O H – not a word.
        A G L O W – “AGLOW” is a valid English word.
        Check positions: A1 (allowed), G2 (new letter), L3 (allowed), O4 (allowed), W5 (new letter).
        All constraints satisfied.

Case 2 – A in position 4
   _ _ _ A _

   Possibilities:
