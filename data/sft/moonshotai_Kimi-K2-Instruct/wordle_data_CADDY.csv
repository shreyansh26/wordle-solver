For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and will give me good information about the secret word. A classic starting word for Wordle-like games is ""SLATE"" because it contains several of the most common letters in English (S, L, A, T, E) and can help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S and L and T and E are **not in the word at all** (x).  
- A is present **but in the wrong position** (-).  In SLATE, A was in position 3, so the word contains A but not in that slot.

Therefore the secret word:
- Must contain the letter A.
- Cannot contain S, L, T, or E.
- The A is **not** in position 3, so it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A (not in position 3) and avoids S, L, T, E.

Good candidates:
- ABBOT (but has two B’s – not ideal for info)
- RADIO
- CANDY
- BRAIN
- FAIRY

Among these, “RADIO” introduces three new consonants (R, D, I) plus the already known A, none of which are in excluded list. This seems like a strong next probe.

Now we know:

- A is in the word AND in the correct position 2 (A ✓ in R A _ _ _)
- D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (D - in R A D I O)
- S, L, T, E, R, I, O are not in the word at all (x on those letters)

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _
The known letters: A (fixed at 2), D (somewhere else)
Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, I, O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has D in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Only uses letters not marked x.

Possible consonants left (after excluding the x letters): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ _ with D in one of the remaining slots and no forbidden letters.

Some candidates:
- C A N D Y (D in 4, but Y is allowed)
- F A D E D (but E is forbidden)
- M A D G E (E forbidden)
- B A N D A (letters ok, but A already fixed at 2)
- H A N D Y (Y allowed, no forbidden letters)

""H A N D Y"" seems good:
- A is in position 2 ✓
- D is in position 3, but feedback said D is in word but wrong position (from RADIO where D was 3, it got -). So D cannot be in 3 – therefore H A N D Y is invalid as D appears in 3.

- D in 4 ✓ (allowed, since D just can't be in 3)
- No forbidden letters S, L, T, E, R, I, O in it.

From the latest feedback on CANDY:

- C(✓) – letter C is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- A(✓) – letter A is in the word and in the correct position 2.
- D(✓) – letter D is in the word and in the correct position 4.
- Y(✓) – letter Y is in the word and in the correct position 5.
- N(x) – letter N is NOT in the word.

So far we have:
Position 1: C
Position 2: A
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: D
Position 5: Y

We know the word is C A _ D Y.

We also know from earlier feedback that the following letters are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, N.

So position 3 must be one of the remaining unused letters that haven't been ruled out. Let's list possible consonants allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with C A and ends with D Y, with any one of the above letters in position 3.

Possible candidates:
- C A B D Y → not a valid English word
- C A F D Y → not valid
- C A G D Y → not valid
- C A H D Y → not valid
- C A J D Y → not valid
- C A K D Y → C A K D Y → ""caked"" exists but is spelled C A K E D (with E which we know is forbidden)
- C A M D Y → not valid
- C A P D Y → not valid
- C A Q D Y → not valid
- C A U D Y → ""cau dy"" doesn't exist
- C A V D Y → not valid
- C A W D Y → not valid
- C A X D Y → not valid
- C A Z D Y → not valid

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe position 3 is a vowel? But we know E and I and O are forbidden, and A is already used in position 2. The remaining vowels are U.

So try C A U D Y → ""CAUDY"" isn't a recognized English word.

Wait, let's think of actual English words that fit C A _ D Y. The only common one is:

- C A D D Y (but position 4 is D, so C A D D Y would have two D's, but we know D is only once since it was marked ✓ in position 4 and no indication it's elsewhere)

But C A D D Y has D in positions 3 and 4, but our feedback shows D is correct in position 4, so position 3 can't also be D (since we'd have two D's and feedback would likely indicate that). Also, CADDY wasn't ruled out by previous guesses.

Let me double-check: in CANDY, D was in position 4 and got ✓, meaning D is in that exact spot. So C A _ D Y must have D only in position 4.

The only valid English word fitting C A _ D Y is C A K D Y? Doesn't exist. Actually, the word is likely C A K D Y doesn't exist but C A M D Y doesn't either. 

Wait, the word must be C A B D Y? No. Let me think differently - what 5-letter English words are C A _ D Y?

The correct word is ""CADDY"" but that would require two D's, and we know from CANDY that D is only in position 4 (✓). So CADDY would have D in position 3 and 4, but position 3's D would not be correct (since in CANDY, D was position 4 and ✓, meaning it's only in position 4). So CADDY can't be right.

This suggests the word must be C A _ D Y with a single D in position 4, and position 3 being a letter not yet used. The only possible letter left that forms a valid word is ""C A P D Y"" – but that's not a word.

I think I may have missed something. Let me re-examine possible letters for position 3. Actually, the word ""C A M D Y"" isn't valid, but ""C A R D Y"" is a word (though R is forbidden). 

Wait, the only valid English word with C A _ D Y is ""CADDY"", but that conflicts with the single D in position 4. This implies I might have made an error earlier, or the word is indeed CADDY with D in both positions 3 and 4, but the feedback would have shown D in position 4 as ✓ and position 3 as - if D were elsewhere. 

But in CANDY, D was position 4 and ✓, meaning D is only in position 4. Therefore, position 3 must be a letter that makes a valid word with C A _ D Y, but none seem to exist except CADDY which conflicts.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""CAFDY"" – no. Actually, the word must be ""CADDY"", accepting that the feedback allows for the D in position 4 to be correct, and position 3's D would be extra. But the feedback would have indicated that D is in the word but in wrong position if it were in position 3, but in CANDY, D was position 4 and ✓, so D is only in position 4, no other D's.

This seems to imply no valid word fits, which can't be right. I must have missed a letter. Let me list all possible letters for position 3 that haven't been ruled out: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only one that forms a real word is ""C A M D Y"" – no. ""C A P D Y"" – no. ""C A K D Y"" – no. 

Actually, the word is ""CADDY"" and it seems the feedback must accommodate that. Since in CANDY, D was in position 4 and got ✓, and in RADIO, D was in position 3 and got - (wrong position), this is consistent with D being in position 4 in the actual word. Thus, the word is CADDY, with D in position 4 and also position 3, but the feedback in CANDY didn't mark position 3's N, it marked position 4's D as correct, implying position 3 is not D. This is confusing.

Re-evaluating: the word is C A _ D Y and position 3 must be a letter not yet used that forms a valid word. The only possible valid word is ""CADDY"" with D in position 3 and 4, but since position 4's D is correct, position 3's D would have to be wrong, but we have no other options. 

Upon reflection, the correct word fitting all constraints is indeed CADDY, accepting that the feedback implies D is in position 4 (✓) and position 3 is another letter, but no other letter fits. This suggests the word must be CADDY despite the apparent inconsistency. 

However, looking back, in CANDY:
- C(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- N(x) – so N not in word
- D(✓) position 4
- Y(✓) position 5

Thus the word is C A _ D Y with position 3 not N and not any previously excluded letters. The only valid English word is CADDY, implying position 3 is D, but that would mean two D's. Since D was ✓ in position 4, and - in position 3 of RADIO (meaning D is in word but not position 3), this is consistent with D being only in position 4. 

This seems impossible - no valid word fits C A _ D Y with D only in position 4. Realizing the oversight: the word is actually CADDY, and the feedback is consistent because in CANDY, position 3's N was marked x, not D. The word must be CADDY.

Therefore, the correct next guess is CADDY.

Based on the feedback:

- C A _ D Y is confirmed with C, A, D, Y fixed in positions 1,2,4,5 respectively.
