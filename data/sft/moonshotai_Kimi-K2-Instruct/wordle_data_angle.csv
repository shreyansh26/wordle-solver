2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. The most common letters in English are ETAOIN SHRDLU. A good first word uses a mix of these. 

Some top contenders are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - covers 5 of the top 10 most common letters
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - similar coverage
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - good consonant/vowel mix
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - heavy on vowels but misses common consonants

I'll choose STARE because it includes S (very common), T (very common), A (most common vowel), R (very common), and E (most common letter overall). This gives us great coverage to gather information efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- A is IN the word but in the wrong position (-). It is NOT in position 3.
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- E is IN the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or R.

Good vowel-heavy words starting with A could be useful since A is likely in position 1, 2, or 4. Common consonants left to try include N, L, C, M, D, etc. A word like PLANE has P, L, N, A, E and fits the constraints (A not in position 3, E in position 5), and uses common consonants P, L, N. Another option is CLAVE, but V is less common. PLANE seems safer to test more common letters.

Let me verify PLANE:
- P - new letter
- L - new letter
- A - in the word, but can't be in position 3 (currently position 3, so this is bad - A would be marked ✓ or -, but position 3 is invalid for A). So PLANE is invalid for A position.

Better option: CLEAN
- C - new letter
- L - new letter
- E - already confirmed in position 5 (matches)
- A - in position 4 (not 3, so allowed)
- N - new letter

This tests C, L, N and confirms A position 4.

CLEAN  
C(x)  → C is NOT in the word  
L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 3 → contradicts nothing, we already know E is in position 5 (✓)  
A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 4  
N(-)  → N is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So the updated set of facts is:
- Letters known to be present: A, E, L, N  
- Letters known to be absent: S, T, R, C  
- E is fixed in position 5  
- A cannot be in position 3 or 4  
- L cannot be in position 2  
- N cannot be in position 5  

Because A, L, E, N are all confirmed present and we have 5 positions, the remaining unknown letter must be one we haven’t tested yet.  
Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 must hold A, L, N and one new letter, with constraints:
- A must be in 1 or 2  
- L cannot be in 2  
- N can be anywhere except 5  

Let’s try A in position 1 and L in position 3 (allowed), N in position 2 (allowed), and choose a common consonant we haven’t used for position 4. Common unused consonants include D, M, P, B, G, etc.

A good candidate: A N L D E  
Check ANLDE – not a valid word. Try ANGLE:  
A N G L E  
- A (position 1) – fits A must be present and allowed in 1  
- N (position 2) – fits N must be present and allowed in 2  
- G – new letter, good coverage  
- L (position 4) – fits L must be present and allowed in 4  
- E (position 5) – already fixed
