For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in the English language. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common.

Looking at this list, a word like ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- A(-): A is in the word but in a wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in a wrong position.
- E(-): E is in the word but in a wrong position.

So we know:
- Must contain: A, S, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Must NOT contain: R or O.
- Positions 2 and 3 are still unknown.

The word pattern so far: _ _ _ _ _ with constraints.

Because A is in the word but not in position 1, possible positions for A are 2,3,4,5.
Because S is in the word but not in position 4, possible positions for S are 1,2,3,5.
Because E is in the word but not in position 5, possible positions for E are 1,2,3,4.

Also, we cannot use R or O.

A common word that fits these constraints: ""EASILY"" is too long, ""EAST"" is too short. ""EASY"" is 4 letters. ""LEASE"" is 5 letters and uses L, E, A, S, E which fits constraints:
- L (new common letter to test)
- E must be in word (from feedback), position 1 is allowed since E was not in position 5
- A is in word, position 2 is allowed
- S is in word, position 3 is allowed (wasn't in position 4)
- E is in word, position 5 was excluded so position 4 is allowed

Wait, actually position 5 was excluded for E, so E can be in 1-4. ""LEASE"" has E in positions 1 and 4, but we don't know if E is doubled. A better word might be ""EASY"" but that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""STEAL"" - but has S in position 1 (allowed), T (new), E (allowed in 2), A (allowed in 3), L (new). This seems good.

""STEAL"":
- S in position 1 (was not in 4, so 1 is allowed)
- T (new common letter)
- E in position 2 (was not in 5, so 2 is allowed)
- A in position 3 (was not in 1, so 3 is allowed)
- L (new common letter)

This tests new letters T and L while keeping known letters A, S, E in new positions.
