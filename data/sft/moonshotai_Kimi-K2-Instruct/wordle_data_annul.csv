For the first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word would contain several of these.

Looking at 5-letter words that use common letters:
- ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E (5 very common letters)
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E (5 very common letters)
- ""STARE"" contains S, T, A, R, E (5 very common letters)

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. R is the 3rd most common letter
2. A is 1st
3. I is 9th
4. S is 7th
5. E is 1st (tied with A)

This gives us good coverage of vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

Current information:

- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we don’t yet fully know:
  – A (position 1 is locked)
  – U (somewhere, but not position 2)
  – N (position 3 is locked)

So we must place U somewhere other than position 2 and fill the remaining slots with still-allowed letters.

Allowed letters left:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word would contain several of these.

Looking at 5-letter words that use common letters:
- ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E (5 very common letters)
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E (5 very common letters)
- ""STARE"" contains S, T, A, R, E (5 very common letters)

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. R is the 3rd most common letter
2. A is 1st
3. I is 9th
4. S is 7th
5. E is 1st (tied with A)

This gives us good coverage of vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- R(x)  → R is not in the word at all.  
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- I(x), S(x), E(x) → I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in slot 2).  
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.  

We need a new word that:
- Uses A somewhere other than position 2.  
- Avoids R, I, S, E.  
- Uses common remaining consonants and remaining vowels (O, U, T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good candidate would be a word like “ADOPT” (but it has an O and a P).  
Let’s try “ADOPT”:  
- A is in slot 1 (allowed, since A can be anywhere except slot 2).  
- D, O, P, T are all allowed consonants/vowels not ruled out.  

Another quick check: “ADOPT” has no R, I, S, E, and A is allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, D, O, P, T (from the x-feedback).
2. Letter A is in the word and is in position 1 (because A(✓) in ADOPT).

Therefore the word looks like: A _ _ _ _

We still need four more letters, none of which can be R, I, S, E, D, O, P, T.

Remaining consonants that are common and still allowed:  
B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, Y, W, V, etc.

Remaining vowels:  
Only U is left (A is already used and in position 1, and E, I, O are ruled out).

So the word must be of the form A _ _ _ _ with the remaining letters chosen from {B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, Y, W, V, etc.}.

A good next step is to include the only remaining vowel U and some common consonants like L and N or C and H. For example:

- AUNCH: uses U, N, C, H (all allowed).
- BLANK: but N and K are allowed, B is allowed, L is allowed, but there's no U here, and we might want to test U.

From feedback so far:

- Fixed letters:
  A _ N _ _  (A at 1, N at 3)

- Status of other letters:
  L: in word but not at position 2  
  U: in word but not at positions 2,4,5 (from U(-) in guesses 3 and 4) – so U must be at position 3.  
  But position 3 is already taken by N.  
  Therefore this is impossible: we have a contradiction.

The only resolution is that U must have been meant to go at a position that is still open.  
Rechecking:

- U(-) in UNCH (guess 3) means U not at 2.  
- U(-) in ALGNU (guess 4) means U not at 5.  
So U must be at position 4.

Thus pattern is now:
A _ N U _

Required letters so far: A, N, U, and we also know L is somewhere but not at 2.  
The only remaining slot for L is 5.

Thus the word must be:

From remaining common letters, M is still allowed.

Therefore one plausible word is:

Try the only dictionary-valid word that fits:
A L N U L – also invalid.  
A K N U L – invalid.

Real dictionary check: the only valid English word that is A _ N U L is ""ANNUL"".

""ANNUL"" → A N N U L.

Let’s test:  
Positions: 1:A (✓), 2:N (untested so far), 3:N (but N is already locked at 3, so this would duplicate).  
Feedback would show N at 3 already.  

""ANNUL"" has N at 2 and 3.

A _ N U L

The blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out and not yet placed.  
Looking at allowed consonants (excluding R,I,S,E,D,O,P,T,C,H,G,B,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z).  
From remaining common letters, M is still allowed.

Therefore one plausible word is:
A M N U L  → ""AMNUL"" – but that isn’t an English word.  
Try the only dictionary-valid word that fits:
A L N U L – also invalid.  
A K N U L – invalid.

Real dictionary check: the only valid English word that is A _ N U L is ""ANNUL"".  
But N is already at position 3, so position 2 cannot be N again (unless double N).  
""ANNUL"" → A N N U L.

Let’s test:  
Positions: 1:A (✓), 2:N (untested so far), 3:N (but N is already locked at 3, so this would duplicate).  
Feedback would show N at 3 already.  

""ANNUL"" has N at 2 and 3.  
But our feedback already placed N at 3, so N at 2 would show up as N(-) (correct letter, wrong place).  
Let’s try ""ANNUL"".

<guess>ANNUL</guess>",Guess 5: ANNUL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) U(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
