For the first guess in Wordle, it's ideal to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting some feedback. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some common strong first words are SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, or STARE. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about what letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter E.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
3. The E cannot be in the 5th position (since that’s where it was in SLATE).

I need a 5-letter word without S, L, A, T, but including E somewhere other than the last position. Good consonants left to try include R, N, D, C, M, P, etc. 

A strong second guess is “MERRY”:
- Contains E (twice) and common letters M, R, Y.
- No S, L, A, T.
- The E is in a new position (3rd and 4th letters).

From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (crossed out):  
S L A T M R Y  

Letters that ARE in the word, but not yet in correct positions:  
E  

So the secret word must:
- contain E at least once (and E is not in position 2 or 5, since it appeared in those spots with the “wrong-position” mark).
- use only letters from the remaining alphabet pool:  
  B C D F G H I J K N O P Q U V W X Z  
  (plus the already-confirmed E).

Five-letter words that fit:
- must include E, but E cannot be 2nd or 5th letter.
- must use only the allowed letters.

Good candidate letters to include: C, D, N, I, O, U, K, B, etc.

One strong word that satisfies these constraints is “CHIDE”:
- C, H, I, D, E are all allowed.
- E is in position 5, which has NOT been ruled out yet (only position 2 and 5 were tested previously; position 5 was ruled out for the E in SLATE, but not for CHIDE because that was a different trial).  
Wait: actually SLATE had E in position 5 with “-” feedback, so E definitely cannot be in position 5.  
Let’s pick E in position 3 or 4 instead.

A better choice: “DUNCE”  
- D, U, N, C, E all allowed.  
- E is in position 5, again ruled out.

Next choice: “NICHE”

From all feedback so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, M, R, Y, W, O, K, N
- The only letter we know IS in the word, but whose exact position is unknown, is E
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (based on it being “wrong position” in MERRY, WOKEN, and SLATE respectively).

So E must sit in position 1 or 3.

Remaining usable letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z  
+ the confirmed letter E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E exactly once (no repeated letters help us here).
2. Places E in position 1 or 3.
3. Uses only the remaining letters above.

Candidates fitting these rules:
- E (1st): no standard 5-letter words start with E and avoid all the banned letters (e.g. EJECT has J and C available, but J is allowed; let’s check EJECT – J is allowed, C and T are allowed but T is ruled out).  
  EJECT contains J, E, C, T – T is banned ⇒ no.
- E (3rd):  
  – BIBLE? B, I, B, L, E – L is banned ⇒ no.  
  – FENCE? F, E, N, C, E – N is banned ⇒ no.  
  – CEDED? C, E, D, E, D – double E ⇒ redundant feedback, but valid letters.  
  – VEXED? V, E, X, E, D – double E ⇒ again redundant.  
  – FIQUE? F, I, Q, U, E – letters all allowed and E in 5th (ruled out).  
  – PIQUE? P, I, Q, U, E – same issue with E in 5th.  
  – EQUIP? E, Q, U, I, P – letters all allowed, E in 1st position, no banned letters.  
     EQUIP satisfies every constraint:
     - Uses only P, I, Q, U, E (all allowed).  
     - Contains E in position 1 (not yet ruled out).  
     - All other positions use fresh letters.

Therefore, EQUIP is the best next guess.
