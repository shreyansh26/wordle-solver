For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters, especially vowels and frequently used consonants, to maximize information gained. Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - covering three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good mix to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""AROSE"":
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked -).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S in any position.

To maximize information, choose a word with new common consonants that haven’t been tried yet, plus the known E. Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A solid option that fits these constraints is ""UNTIE"":
- Includes E (not at the end).
- Uses new consonants N, T, I (vowel), and U (vowel) we haven’t tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

This will help narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

From the two guesses and their feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S
   – Letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 1-5 (because every position of E in AROSE and UNTIE is marked -).

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   – Letters not in the word: N, I
   – Letters U and T are in the word but NOT in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   – E still must appear somewhere, but we now know it’s not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from UNTIE) and also not in position 5 (from AROSE). The only remaining slot for E is position 1.

So far we know:
- The word has the letters E, U, T (each at least once).
- E must be in position 1.
- U is NOT in position 1.
- T is NOT in position 3.
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, N, I.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-known U and T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E.
- Contains U and T somewhere in positions 2-5, with T not in position 3.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

A straightforward candidate is “ELUTE”:
- E in position 1 (required).
- L (new letter) in position 2.
- U in position 3.
- T in position 4.
- E in position 5.

Let’s check:
– Letters used: E, L, U, T, E – all allowed, no forbidden letters.
– T is in position 4 (not 3) – satisfies the positional constraint.
– U is in position 3 (not 1) – satisfies its positional constraint.

From the combined feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – Excluded letters: A, R, O, S
   – E is in the word but was “-” in every position tried so far (positions 1,2,3,5).

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   – Excluded letters: N, I
   – U is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1
   – T is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3
   – E is still marked “-” (so E is NOT in positions 2,3,4,5).

3. ELUTE → E(✓) L(-) U(✓) T(-) E(-)
   – E is now confirmed at position 1 (✓).
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   – U is confirmed in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it was marked ✓ at position 3, so no conflict—actually it is confirmed at position 3, so ignore earlier “-” on U).
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Let’s re-summarize:

- Fixed: 1st letter = E.
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, N, I.
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus E, U, T, L.
- U is in the word; currently known position 3 but since it was marked ✓ there, it must be exactly at position 3.
- T is in the word but NOT at position 4 (and earlier not at position 3).
- L is in the word but NOT at position 2.

Word structure so far:
E _ U _ _

We know T and L must appear somewhere in the remaining two slots (positions 2 and 5), but:
- T cannot be in position 4 (but 4 is U here, so T can be in position 2 or 5)
- L cannot be in position 2, so L must be in position 5, and T in position 2.

So the pattern must be:
E T U _ L

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits E T U _ L. The missing letter (position 4) must be from the allowed set. Trying consonants:
- ETUCL, ETUFL, ETUGL… “ETUDL” doesn’t work.
- Only one common word fits: E T U _ L → “E T U D L” → “ETUDL” is invalid.
- Wait, try “ETUDE” – but that would conflict with E at position 5.
- Actually, the only dictionary word matching E T U _ L is “ETUDL” which isn’t valid. Recheck: the missing letter must be a consonant we haven’t excluded. Let’s list possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

“ETUDL” is not a word. Next valid word: “ETU _ L” – “ETUPL” no, “ETUFL” no… Actually, “ETUDE” is 5 letters but E at 5 is excluded. Realizing there’s no valid English word E T U _ L, so pattern must be wrong. 

Wait: in step 3 feedback, U was marked ✓ at position 3, so U is at position 3. Thus structure is:
E _ U _ _

T must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 4 because it was “-” there).
L must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 2 because it was “-” there), so L must be at 5. Thus T must be at 2.

So the word must be: E T U _ L. The blank must be a consonant (allowed). Valid word: “ETUDL” – invalid. Thus no such word. Rechecking: perhaps position 4 can be a vowel? But E and U already used, and A, O, I excluded. Remaining vowels: none. So consonant only.

Realizing now: the only possible valid word matching E _ U _ L with T at 2 is “ETUDL” – invalid. Thus my earlier deduction is flawed. Actually, the feedback on L says L is in word but NOT at position 2, so L can be at 4 or 5. Similarly, T is in word but NOT at 4 (and earlier not at 3), so T can be at 2 or 5. Let’s re-approach.

We know:
E _ U _ _
Letters to place: T, L
Constraints:
- L not at 2
- T not at 4
Thus possible positions:
- L at 4 or 5
- T at 2 or 5
And we cannot have both at 5. So two possibilities:
1. T at 2, L at 4 or 5
   – E T U L _ → “ETUL_” – missing 5th letter, must be consonant, e.g., “ETULB” (invalid)
   – E T U _ L → “ETU _ L” – missing 4th letter: “ETUDL” invalid
2. T at 5, L at 4
   – E _ U L T → word: “E _ U L T” – missing 2nd letter: “E B U L T” → “EBULT” invalid, “EDULT” invalid, “EHULT” invalid…
   – Actually, “EXULT” fits: E X U L T. Check letters: X is allowed (not excluded). Is “EXULT” valid? Yes, it means to show elation.

Thus “EXULT” is a valid candidate:
- E fixed at 1
- U at 3 (✓)
- X (new consonant) at 2
- L at 4
- T at 5

All constraints satisfied.
