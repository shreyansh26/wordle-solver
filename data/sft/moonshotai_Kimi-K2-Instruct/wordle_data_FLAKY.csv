For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll create a word using as many of these as possible.

One excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This should help me quickly identify which of these important letters are in the secret word and give me good information to narrow down possibilities for my next guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must appear later).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Next I want to test other common letters while also placing A in a new spot. Good remaining common consonants are: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Good vowels left are I and U (since A is already confirmed).

I’ll form a word that avoids the forbidden letters (R,O,S,E), uses A in a new position, and introduces several other fresh common letters.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- U, N, T, I, L are all new letters.
- The letter A is not used, but that’s fine because we already know A exists and we can place it later once we have more constraints.
- UNTIL tests five new common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: only Y is left as a pseudo-vowel, since A is already placed and E, I, O, U are out

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available pool, ensuring we make valid 5-letter words.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same pool
- Position 5: same pool

Some good candidates to test:
1. BLADY - but Y at end might be less common
2. FLANK - K is still available
3. GLADE - but E is ruled out
4. BLAND - D is available
5. CLAV? - but C is out

Let me try BLAND:
- B, N, D are new letters
- N was in UNTIL and ruled out (got x), so N is out - can't use BLAND

FLANK:
- F, K are new
- N is out (from UNTIL)
- So FLANK is invalid

GLADY:
- G, D, Y are new
- This uses known L and A correctly

Actually, let me check B-y-l-a-? No, structure is _ L A _ _

BLAZY: uses Z which is possible
B L A Z Y

But is BLAZY a valid word? Yes, it means ""burning fiercely"" or can describe something obvious.

Another option: GLAZY - but starts with G
G L A Z Y

But we need to test letters efficiently. Between B and G, B is more common.

I'll go with BLAZY as it tests B, Z, Y in new positions.

Wait, looking back at the ruled out letters: I don't see Y listed as tested. Let me verify:
- Previous guesses: AROSE, UNTIL, CLAMP
- Letters in these: A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,I,L,C,M,P
- So Y is indeed still available

BLAZY seems like a strong test.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll create a word using as many of these as possible.

One excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This should help me quickly identify which of these important letters are in the secret word and give me good information to narrow down possibilities for my next guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must appear later).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Next I want to test other common letters while also placing A in a new spot. Good remaining common consonants are: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Good vowels left are I and U (since A is already confirmed).

I’ll form a word that avoids the forbidden letters (R,O,S,E), uses A in a new position, and introduces several other fresh common letters.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- U, N, T, I, L are all new letters.
- The letter A is not used, but that’s fine because we already know A exists and we can place it later once we have more constraints.
- UNTIL tests five new common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: A and L (both were marked “-”, so each appears somewhere but not where we placed them).

Since A was first and now L was fifth, we need to place them in different positions.  
Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out include: D, C, M, P, G, B, Y, K, H, F, V, W, etc.  
Vowels still left: none except A (since U, O, I, E are all out).

Let’s construct a word that:
1. Uses both known letters A and L,
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1,
3. Places L somewhere other than position 5,
4. Introduces three completely new letters from the pool of still-possible consonants.

Candidate word: CLAMP
- C, M, P are new.
- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- L is in position 3 (not 5).
