For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering this, ""AROSE"" is a good initial guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps quickly identify or eliminate vowels.
2. It has common consonants R and S which are frequently in English words.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the information from 5 unique letters.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A, O, S, E are not in their guessed positions; A and O could still be elsewhere in the word, while S and E are completely ruled out.

So we know:
- The pattern is _ R _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: S, E
- We keep A and O in mind as possible letters elsewhere, but not in 1st or 3rd positions.
- Try to introduce new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: T, I, N, L, D, M, etc.

A strong next word is ""TRIUM"" – it uses T, I, U, M while keeping the R fixed in 2nd place. But ""TRIUM"" isn't a valid 5-letter English word. Instead, ""TRIUM"" is misspelled; ""TRIUN"" is also invalid. 

Better valid options: 
- ""TRICK"" – uses T, I, C, K with R in place. But C and K are both consonants and might not give vowel info.
- ""TRAIN"" – uses T, A, I, N. A is already known not to be in 1st position, but could be elsewhere.
- ""DRINK"" – introduces D, I, N, K.

""DRINK"" is good because:
- Keeps R in 2nd place.
- Introduces D, I, N, K – none used before.
- Covers new vowel I and common consonants D, N, K.

Alternative: ""FRUIT"" – but F and T are less common, and U wasn't tested yet. ""DRINK"" seems more balanced.

I choose ""DRINK"".

Summary of what we know so far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, D, I, N, K, O  (so far 8 distinct letters are out)
- R is confirmed in position 2.

We still need to test some common vowels (U has not appeared yet, Y could also be a vowel here) and consonants (T, L, B, M, H, G, C, F, P, V, etc.).

Because we’ve ruled out so many letters, we should pick a word that:
1. Keeps R in place.
2. Introduces as many *new* untested common letters as possible.
3. Avoids any of the 8 eliminated letters.

A quick scan of the remaining alphabet yields letters like B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

A strong next guess would use five of these, with at least one vowel (U or Y).  
Possible candidates:
- “TRUMP” – but P hasn’t been ruled out, and U gives us a new vowel.  
- “GRUMY” – but Y is sometimes counted as a vowel here; also “GRUMY” isn’t a valid dictionary word.  
- “TRULY” – uses T, U, L, Y and keeps R in position 2. It’s valid and introduces four fresh letters.

I’ll pick “TRULY” because:
- T, U, L, Y are all new and common.
- It doesn’t repeat any eliminated letters.
- It gives us a second vowel test (U) and the sometimes-vowel Y.

We now know:

- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- R is locked in position 2.
- Letters ruled out so far (from all guesses):
  A, S, E, D, I, N, K, O, T, U, L, Y  (12 distinct letters).
- Remaining common letters that have not appeared yet:
  B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, and the vowel (or sometimes-vowel) combinations that are still possible.

Given the small remaining set of untested letters, we should choose a word that:
1. Keeps R in the second position.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Introduces as many new, common letters as possible to maximize information.

Looking at the remaining alphabet and valid English 5-letter words, the best candidate seems to be “CRUMB”:
- C, U, M, B are all new (U was tested in TRULY and ruled out, so strike that).  
Wait, U was already marked “x” in TRULY, so U is out.  
Next candidates: “CRAMP” – but A is out. “PROM” – too short. “FRUMP” – U is out.  
“GRUMP” – U is out. “CHARM” – A is out. “BRAVO” – A, O out.  

Realizing the remaining letters are:
- Vowels still possible: none left (A, E, I, O, U, Y all eliminated) except… actually all standard vowels are out. That implies the word must use Y again (but Y was eliminated), or…. wait, this must be an oversight.

Double-check:
From feedback:
- AROSE: A(-) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
- DRINK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)
- TRULY: T(x) R(✓) U(x) L(x) Y(x)

So vowels eliminated: A, E, I, O, U, Y.  
Consonants eliminated: S, D, N, K, T, L.  
Still available consonants: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, X, Z, but we need to form a 5-letter word with R in 2nd place and no vowels… impossible, as English 5-letter words must contain at least one vowel.

This contradiction means either:
1. I misread the feedback, or
2. The hidden word uses a vowel that was marked “-” (present but wrong position) rather than “x”.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In AROSE: A(-) means A exists but not in 1st position.
- O(-) means O exists but not in 3rd position.
- S(x), E(x) means S and E do not appear at all.
- In DRINK: I(x) means I does not appear at all. N(x), K(x), D(x) ruled out.
- In TRULY: U(x), L(x), T(x), Y(x) ruled out.

So vowels still alive:
- A (exists somewhere not 1st)
- O (exists somewhere not 3rd)

Consonants still alive (not ruled out):
- B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, plus R (locked in 2nd).

Thus valid pattern: _ R _ _ _ with A and/or O somewhere, plus remaining consonants.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ R _ _ _, using only letters from the allowed set, with at least one of A or O in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- B R A V O (but O is allowed only not in 3rd; here it’s in 5th, so ok) – but we don’t know if both A and O are present, or just one.
- C R O W D (but D ruled out)
- F R O S T (S ruled out)
- C R A B S (S ruled out)
- P R A Y S (Y, S ruled out)
- B R O A D (D ruled out)
- F R A M E (E ruled out)
- G R A P E (E ruled out)
- V R O O M (V, R, O, O, M – but O appears twice, and 2nd O is in 4th, allowed, but is “VROOM” valid? Yes.)
- C R O A K (K ruled out)
- P R O W L (L ruled out)
- B R O W N (N ruled out)
- C R O C K (K, C repeated)
- G R O U P (U ruled out)
- C R A Z E (Z allowed, E ruled out)
- B R A V E (E ruled out)
- C R A Z Y (Y ruled out)

So the best remaining candidate with the most new letters is “BROAD”:
- B, R, O, A, D – but D is ruled out (from DRINK).  
Next: “CROAK” – K out.  
“GROAN” – N out.  
“GROAT” – T out.  
“GROMA” – not a word.  
“CRAMP” – A out (position 3 ok, but M, P ok).  

Actually, “CRAMP”:
- C, R, A, M, P  
- A is allowed (not in 1st), R in 2nd.  
- All letters are fresh except A (marked “-” in 1st guess, so A exists somewhere).  

But does “CRAMP” fit the pattern? Yes: _ R A M P.  
But wait, A was ruled out of 1st position, but can be anywhere else.  

However, “CRAMP” might be valid in dictionary, but we need to confirm if it’s a standard Wordle word.  

Another candidate: “GRAMP” – same issue.  

Realizing “BRAID” – B, R, A, I, D – I and D out.  
“BRAVO” – O in 5th ok, A in 3rd: B R A V O. All letters fresh except A (allowed).  

“BRAVO”:
- B, R, A, V, O  
- R is 2nd.  
- A allowed (not 1st), O allowed (not 3rd).  
- All letters new except A and O (marked “-” earlier, so they belong somewhere).  

“BRAVO” seems solid.
