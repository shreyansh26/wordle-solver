2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather maximum information about the secret word. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

I'll choose **CRANE** because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters to test.

So far we know:

A ✓ (correct at position 3)  
N x (not in the word)  
E x (not in the word)

Letters ruled out: N, E

Letters still unknown: positions 4 and 5.

To probe the remaining letters efficiently, I want a word that:
- Keeps the three fixed letters (C, R, A) in place.
- Uses new, common letters for positions 4 and 5 while avoiding N and E.

Good candidate consonants for those last two spots: S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

Testing CRA_S would be nice; let’s pick CRAZY (Z is less common, but Y is common and still tells us a lot) or CRAMP (P is common).  
Another safe, informative choice is CRASH (S and H are both common).

I’ll go with CRASH.

Current knowledge:

- Positions 1-3 are locked in as C R A.
- Letters already eliminated: N, E, S, H.
- So we need two new, unused letters for positions 4-5, preferably common ones.

The remaining consonants not yet tried and still common include: T, L, D, M, B, G, K.

Vowels left to test: I, O, U, Y (but Y is sometimes a vowel).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern CRA?? and only introduces two new letters that haven’t been marked ✗ yet.

Candidate endings:
- CRACK (K is new, C is already known but okay to reuse here)
- CRAM?  → CRAMP (P is new)
- CRAG?  → CRAGS (but S is out)
- CRATE → CRATL (invalid)
- CRAFT (F & T both untested)

Actually, CRAFT uses F and T, both unused so far, and both relatively common. It also forms a valid English word.

Second choice: CRAGY (G and Y), but Y is less common and possibly duplicative.

Third choice: CRAMP (P and M), but P and M are both good.

I’ll pick CRAFT because F and T are high-frequency letters in English and give us new information.
