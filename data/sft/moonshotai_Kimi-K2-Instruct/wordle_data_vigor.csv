For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) have been marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates:
- Vowels: A, E  
- Consonants: S, L, T  

So the remaining vowels to test are I, O, U and the remaining common consonants include R, N, C, H, D, M, etc.  
A good next step is to probe an entirely new set of high-frequency letters.  
Among the common starter words that avoid the forbidden letters, “CRONY” uses:
- C, R (common consonants)
- O (a vowel we still need to check)
- N, Y (additional consonants)

This gives us a fresh group of five letters to see which ones are present.

From the two guesses so far:

- SLATE: every letter (S, L, A, T, E) is absent.
- CRONY: C, N, Y are absent; R and O are somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So we now know:
- The word contains R and O.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: D, H, I, K, P, U, M, G, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need:
- A 5-letter word that includes R and O, places R NOT in position 2, and places O NOT in position 3, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “GROUP”:
- G, R, O, U, P
- R is in position 2 (but CRONY feedback says R cannot be in position 2), so “GROUP” is bad.

Next candidate: “BROAD” – but A is forbidden.

Another: “CHORD” – C and D? C is forbidden.

Next: “DRUID” – D, R, U, I, D. Contains D twice, which is acceptable, and R in position 2 again – same problem.

Try “FROST” – F, R, O, S, T – S and T are forbidden.

“FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T – T forbidden.

“PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O. 
- R is in position 2 (again forbidden).

“AFOUL” – A forbidden.

“BROIL” – L forbidden.

“DROOP” – P twice, but O is in position 3 – O can’t be in position 3.

“ORBIT” – B, R, O, I, T – T forbidden.

“PROUD” – P, R, O, U, D. 
- R in position 2 – again, CRONY said R is in the word but not in position 2, so this is invalid.

“GOURD” – G, O, U, R, D. 
- R is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), and none of the forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

So far we’ve ruled out every letter that has ever appeared in any of the three guesses:

Forbidden:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, G, U, D

Letters we **know** are present:  
R and O (from CRONY and GOURD feedback)

From GOURD we also learned:  
- G is not in the word.  
- O is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
- U is not in the word.  
- R is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- D is not in the word.

So R and O must appear somewhere, and their allowed positions are:

R: allowed in positions 1, 3, 5 (not 2 or 4)  
O: allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)

Remaining letters to choose from (common English letters not yet forbidden):  
B, F, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word containing R and O, using only allowed letters, with R and O in their allowed spots.

A systematic way: list possible placements of R and O, then fill the rest with safe letters.

Possible patterns (underscore = free slot):

Case 1: R at 1
- R _ _ _ _  
  – O can be at 2, 4, or 5  
  – e.g., R O _ _ _  (O at 2 allowed)  
    → need 3 more letters from {B,F,H,I,K,M,P,V,W,...}

Example: R O M P H → ROMPH (valid, no forbidden letters)

Case 2: R at 3
- _ _ R _ _  
  – O can be at 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)  
  – e.g., _ O _ R _  
    → positions 1 and 5 free  
    Example: F O I R K → FOIRK (valid)

Case 3: R at 5
- _ _ _ _ R  
  – O can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 3 from CRONY? Wait CRONY said O is in word but not position 3 **in CRONY**, but doesn’t restrict other positions unless forbidden later; GOURD showed O not in position 2, so O allowed 1,3,4,5 but 5 is R, so 1,3,4)  
  – e.g., _ _ _ O R  
    Example: B I M O R → BIMOR

All three examples are valid; I’ll pick one that uses common letters and spreads coverage.

Let’s go with **FROTH** but T is forbidden.  
**FRISK** – S forbidden.  
**FROWN** – N forbidden.  
**PORCH** – C forbidden.  
**WORRY** – Y forbidden.  
**MORPH** – H allowed, letters M,O,R,P,H all safe.

So **MORPH**:
- M (safe)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- P, H (safe)

It satisfies all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,vigor,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) have been marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates:
- Vowels: A, E  
- Consonants: S, L, T  

So the remaining vowels to test are I, O, U and the remaining common consonants include R, N, C, H, D, M, etc.  
A good next step is to probe an entirely new set of high-frequency letters.  
Among the common starter words that avoid the forbidden letters, “CRONY” uses:
- C, R (common consonants)
- O (a vowel we still need to check)
- N, Y (additional consonants)

This gives us a fresh group of five letters to see which ones are present.

<guess>CRONY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

- SLATE: every letter (S, L, A, T, E) is absent.
- CRONY: C, N, Y are absent; R and O are somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So we now know:
- The word contains R and O.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: D, H, I, K, P, U, M, G, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need:
- A 5-letter word that includes R and O, places R NOT in position 2, and places O NOT in position 3, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “GROUP”:
- G, R, O, U, P
- R is in position 2 (but CRONY feedback says R cannot be in position 2), so “GROUP” is bad.

Next candidate: “BROAD” – but A is forbidden.

Another: “CHORD” – C and D? C is forbidden.

Next: “DRUID” – D, R, U, I, D. Contains D twice, which is acceptable, and R in position 2 again – same problem.

Try “FROST” – F, R, O, S, T – S and T are forbidden.

“FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T – T forbidden.

“PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O. 
- R is in position 2 (again forbidden).

“AFOUL” – A forbidden.

“BROIL” – L forbidden.

“DROOP” – P twice, but O is in position 3 – O can’t be in position 3.

“ORBIT” – B, R, O, I, T – T forbidden.

“PROUD” – P, R, O, U, D. 
- R in position 2 – again, CRONY said R is in the word but not in position 2, so this is invalid.

“GOURD” – G, O, U, R, D. 
- R is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), and none of the forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

So I will guess GOURD.

  – O can be at 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)  
  – e.g., _ O _ R _  
    → positions 1 and 5 free  
    Example: F O I R K → FOIRK (valid)

Case 3: R at 5
- _ _ _ _ R  
  – O can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 3 from CRONY? Wait CRONY said O is in word but not position 3 **in CRONY**, but doesn’t restrict other positions unless forbidden later; GOURD showed O not in position 2, so O allowed 1,3,4,5 but 5 is R, so 1,3,4)  
  – e.g., _ _ _ O R  
    Example: B I M O R → BIMOR

All three examples are valid; I’ll pick one that uses common letters and spreads coverage.

Let’s go with **FROTH** but T is forbidden.  
**FRISK** – S forbidden.  
**FROWN** – N forbidden.  
**PORCH** – C forbidden.  
**WORRY** – Y forbidden.  
**MORPH** – H allowed, letters M,O,R,P,H all safe.

So **MORPH**:
- M (safe)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- P, H (safe)

It satisfies all constraints.

From all four guesses we know:

Forbidden letters so far:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, G, U, D, M, P, H

Letters confirmed present and their remaining possible positions:  
- R somewhere, but NOT positions 2, 4 (from CRONY and GOURD).  
- O somewhere, but NOT positions 2 (from GOURD) and NOT 3 (from CRONY).

Thus:
- R may occupy positions 1, 3, 5.  
- O may occupy positions 1, 4, 5.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, I, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that uses R, O and three of those safe letters, while respecting the positional rules.

Quick scan of the remaining alphabet against a mental word list:

1. R at 1, O at 4 → R _ _ O _ → “RIGOR” has two R’s (invalid), “RIVOT” has T, “RIBOF” is only 5 letters with B,I,F safe → **RIBOF** (valid, no forbidden letters).

2. R at 1, O at 5 → R _ _ _ O → “RIFFO” (fake), “RIFKO” (fake). No common word.

3. R at 3, O at 1 → O _ R _ _ → “OBRIK” (fake), “OWRID” (fake).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) have been marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates:
- Vowels: A, E  
- Consonants: S, L, T  

So the remaining vowels to test are I, O, U and the remaining common consonants include R, N, C, H, D, M, etc.  
A good next step is to probe an entirely new set of high-frequency letters.  
Among the common starter words that avoid the forbidden letters, “CRONY” uses:
- C, R (common consonants)
- O (a vowel we still need to check)
- N, Y (additional consonants)

This gives us a fresh group of five letters to see which ones are present.

<guess>CRONY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

- SLATE: every letter (S, L, A, T, E) is absent.
- CRONY: C, N, Y are absent; R and O are somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

So we now know:
- The word contains R and O.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: D, H, I, K, P, U, M, G, B, F, V, W, etc.

We need:
- A 5-letter word that includes R and O, places R NOT in position 2, and places O NOT in position 3, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “GROUP”:
- G, R, O, U, P
- R is in position 2 (but CRONY feedback says R cannot be in position 2), so “GROUP” is bad.

Next candidate: “BROAD” – but A is forbidden.

Another: “CHORD” – C and D? C is forbidden.

Next: “DRUID” – D, R, U, I, D. Contains D twice, which is acceptable, and R in position 2 again – same problem.

Try “FROST” – F, R, O, S, T – S and T are forbidden.

“FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T – T forbidden.

“PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O. 
- R is in position 2 (again forbidden).

“AFOUL” – A forbidden.

“BROIL” – L forbidden.

“DROOP” – P twice, but O is in position 3 – O can’t be in position 3.

“ORBIT” – B, R, O, I, T – T forbidden.

“PROUD” – P, R, O, U, D. 
- R in position 2 – again, CRONY said R is in the word but not in position 2, so this is invalid.

“GOURD” – G, O, U, R, D. 
- R is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), and none of the forbidden letters appear. This seems valid.

So I will guess GOURD.

<guess>GOURD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: GOURD -> FEEDBACK: G(-) O(-) U(x) R(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we’ve ruled out every letter that has ever appeared in any of the three guesses:

Forbidden:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, G, U, D

Letters we **know** are present:  
R and O (from CRONY and GOURD feedback)

From GOURD we also learned:  
- G is not in the word.  
- O is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
- U is not in the word.  
- R is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- D is not in the word.

So R and O must appear somewhere, and their allowed positions are:

R: allowed in positions 1, 3, 5 (not 2 or 4)  
O: allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)

Remaining letters to choose from (common English letters not yet forbidden):  
B, F, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word containing R and O, using only allowed letters, with R and O in their allowed spots.

A systematic way: list possible placements of R and O, then fill the rest with safe letters.

Possible patterns (underscore = free slot):

Case 1: R at 1
- R _ _ _ _  
  – O can be at 2, 4, or 5  
  – e.g., R O _ _ _  (O at 2 allowed)  
    → need 3 more letters from {B,F,H,I,K,M,P,V,W,...}

Example: R O M P H → ROMPH (valid, no forbidden letters)

Case 2: R at 3
- _ _ R _ _  
  – O can be at 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)  
  – e.g., _ O _ R _  
    → positions 1 and 5 free  
    Example: F O I R K → FOIRK (valid)

Case 3: R at 5
- _ _ _ _ R  
  – O can be at 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 3 from CRONY? Wait CRONY said O is in word but not position 3 **in CRONY**, but doesn’t restrict other positions unless forbidden later; GOURD showed O not in position 2, so O allowed 1,3,4,5 but 5 is R, so 1,3,4)  
  – e.g., _ _ _ O R  
    Example: B I M O R → BIMOR

All three examples are valid; I’ll pick one that uses common letters and spreads coverage.

Let’s go with **FROTH** but T is forbidden.  
**FRISK** – S forbidden.  
**FROWN** – N forbidden.  
**PORCH** – C forbidden.  
**WORRY** – Y forbidden.  
**MORPH** – H allowed, letters M,O,R,P,H all safe.

So **MORPH**:
- M (safe)  
- O in position 2 (allowed)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- P, H (safe)

It satisfies all constraints.

From the five guesses we now have:

Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y, G, U, D, M, P, H, B, F  
Confirmed letters:  
- I is in the word and in position 2 (from RIBOF).  
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from CRONY, GOURD).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from CRONY, GOURD).

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 2 is already I).

Pattern so far: _ I _ _ _

R can be in 1, 3, or 5.  
O can be in 1, 4, or 5 (but cannot collide with R).

Safe remaining letters (none used so far and not forbidden): V, W, K, X, Z – basically only V, W, K are common enough.

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1 – R at 1, O at 4 or 5  
- R I _ O _  – needs one more safe letter in position 3.  
  Only K, V, W are safe.  
  “RIKOV” (fake), “RIVO_” (no common fill).  
- R I _ _ O – same issue.

Case 2 – R at 3  
- _ I R _ _  
  O must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - O I R _ _ – only positions 4 and 5 left, need two distinct safe letters.  
    Possible word: O I R K W – but “OIRKW” is not a real word.  
  - _ I R O _ – needs position 1 and 5.  
    W I R O K – “WIROK” (fake).  
    V I R O K – “VIROK” (fake).  
  - _ I R _ O – same problem.

Case 3 – R at 5  
- _ I _ _ R  
  O must be at 1 or 4.  
  - O I _ _ R – needs positions 3 and 4.  
    O I K W R – “OIKWR” (fake).  
  - _ I _ O R – needs positions 1 and 3.  
    V I K O R – “VIKOR” (fake).  
    W I K O R – “WIKOR” (fake).  

What real 5-letter English words are left that use only the allowed letters and satisfy the rigid placement rules?

Scanning a mental list:

- VIKOR – not in common usage.  
- WIKOR – same.  
- KIROV – K is allowed, but we need I in position 2, so “KIROV” would be K-I-R-O-V, placing I correctly and R in position 3 (allowed), O in position 4 (allowed).  
  And all letters K, I, R, O, V are not forbidden.

“KIROV” is a recognized surname and city name, and it fits the patterns.

Therefore the only logical remaining guess is **KIROV**.
