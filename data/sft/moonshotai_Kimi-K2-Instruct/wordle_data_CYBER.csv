### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- R: a very common consonant
- A: a very common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: a very common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the right or wrong positions, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Feedback recap:
- R is in the word but is NOT in position 1.
- A is NOT in the word at all.
- I is NOT in the word at all.
- S is NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but is NOT in position 5.

So the mystery word:
- Contains R (but not in slot 1) and E (but not in slot 5).
- Does NOT contain A, I, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that satisfies those constraints.  
Good consonants to try next include T, N, L, D, C, while the only vowel we know is E.  
A common pattern that fits is “_ E R _ _” with R moving to slot 3 or 4, or “_ _ E R _”, etc.  
The word “TOWER” uses:
- T (new letter)
- O (new vowel)
- W (new letter)
- E (known to be in word, and putting it in slot 3 is new)
- R (known to be in word, and putting it in slot 5 is new)

This placement respects:
- R is not in slot 1 (it’s in slot 5) ✔  
- E is not in slot 5 (it’s in slot 3) ✔  
- Avoids A, I, S entirely. ✔

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters still possible (from alphabet minus eliminated ones):
- Eliminated so far: A, I, S, T, O, W
- Confirmed present: E (position 4), R (position 5)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E R

Slots 1-3 cannot contain any eliminated letters (A, I, S, T, O, W) and must each be one of:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a real 5-letter English word ending in “ER” with E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
Popular endings after E are limited, but let’s try a common consonant cluster: “N” for position 3, “U” or “L” for position 2, etc.

A quick mental scan of common words ending “_ _ _ ER”:
- LEVER (E already used in 4)
- FEVER (E already used in 4)
- NEVER (N, E, V all still allowed)
- BAKER (A is out)
- CIDER (I is out)
- CYBER (Y, B allowed)

NEVER has N, E, V, E, R – but we know E must be in slot 4 only, and R in slot 5 only. So the word is _ _ _ E R. NEVER actually has E in slot 2 and slot 4, but slot 2 can’t have E because E must be only in slot 4 (confirmed from TOWER feedback). So NEVER is invalid.

CYBER seems to fit:
- C (allowed)
- Y (allowed)
- B (allowed)
- E (must be slot 4) ✔
- R (must be slot 5) ✔

And we haven’t eliminated C, Y, B.
