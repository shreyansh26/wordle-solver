For the first guess, the goal is to gain as much information as possible about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that cover a wide range of possibilities to maximize the feedback received. Common starting words include those with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, and E. This combination provides a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. It can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the target word has:
- An A in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Does not use any of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next are common ones not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong second guess is one that also uses common letters, so I’ll use C, R, H, M, etc. A word that fits is “CHARM”:
- A is 3rd ✓
- Uses C, H, R, M (none of S, L, T, E)

- Include C somewhere other than position 1.
- Only use letters NOT in the excluded list.

1. Position 3 is A (fixed).
   Word pattern: _ _ A _ _

2. Letters confirmed absent:
   S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N

3. Letters confirmed present but placed wrongly:
   - C: must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT at position 1 or 2 (because in CABIN it was at position 1 and got “-” feedback).
   - A: appears somewhere, but we already know it’s fixed at position 3, so the “-” on A in CABIN is irrelevant for our purposes (it just tells us A isn’t also at position 2).

So C must go in position 4 or 5.

4. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
   C, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

5. Need a 5-letter word with:
   - _ _ A _ _
   - Contains C in position 4 or 5.
   - Only uses letters from the allowed set.

Candidate positions for C:
   Either _ _ A C _  or _ _ A _ C

Scanning common words fitting these rules:
   _ _ A C _ : e.g., “VACAY” (Y allowed) but Y not ruled out, but V is okay.
   _ _ A _ C : e.g., “PODAC” is not a word.

“VACAY” is common (slang for vacation) and fits the pattern:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to gain as much information as possible about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that cover a wide range of possibilities to maximize the feedback received. Common starting words include those with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, and E. This combination provides a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. It can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the target word has:
- An A in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Does not use any of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next are common ones not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong second guess is one that also uses common letters, so I’ll use C, R, H, M, etc. A word that fits is “CHARM”:
- A is 3rd ✓
- Uses C, H, R, M (none of S, L, T, E)

<guess>CHARM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHARM -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 3 and none of {S, L, T, E} appear anywhere in the word.

2. CHARM → C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)  
   ⇒ C is in the word but not in first position.  
   ⇒ H, R, M are not in the word at all.

So constraints so far:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters not used: {S, L, T, E, H, R, M}
- Letter known to be present: C (not in position 1)

Next word must:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Include C somewhere other than position 1.
- Only use letters NOT in the excluded list.

Good still-available letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

A word that satisfies these: BIANCA uses too many letters. We need five letters exactly.

Try “CABIN”:
- A in 3 ✓
- C is present and not in position 1 ✓
- B, I, N are still allowed ✓

Check exclusions: none of {S, L, T, E, H, R, M} appear in CABIN. ✓

Let’s list all the hard facts we now have.

Known pattern: _ _ A _ _   (A locked in position 3)

Letters **excluded** from the word (they have all received “x” or are ruled out by placement):
- From SLATE: S, L, T, E  
- From CHARM: H, R, M  
- From CABIN: B, I, N  
- From VACAY: V, Y  

Therefore the remaining alphabet is:
C, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z

Letters **confirmed present** but **mis-placed**:
- C (from CHARM and CABIN and VACAY: each time a “-”) – so C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (those spots have already been tried).  
  The only position still open for C is position 5.

Therefore the pattern is now: _ _ A _ C

We must pick two more letters from the still-allowed set {D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z} for positions 1 and 2.

Choosing common English consonant pairs, one good candidate is:

F, O → FO_A_C → F O A D C (FOADC is not a word)  
D, O → D O A _ C → D O A D C (also invalid)  
G, O → G O A _ C → G O A D C (invalid)  
K, O → K O A _ C → K O A D C (invalid)  
P, O → P O A _ C → P O A D C (invalid)  
D, U → D U A _ C → D U A D C (invalid)  
P, U → P U A _ C → P U A D C (invalid)  
F, U → F U A _ C → F U A D C (invalid)  
J, U → J U A _ C → J U A D C (invalid)

Wait, let’s rethink.  We have only these letters allowed in positions 1 and 2: D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z.  
We need a **real 5-letter English word** of the form * * A * C that uses only those letters.

Scanning possibilities:
- PODAC – not a word  
- GODAC – not a word  
- DUADC – not a word  
- KODAC – not a word  
- JUADC – not a word  
- **KUDAC** – not a word  
- **GODAC** – still not a word  
- **FUDAC** – not a word  

Hold on: let’s search systematically for real words * * A * C with letters from {D,F,G,J,K,O,P,U,W,Z} in positions 1 and 2.

Real English words ending in “AC” (with A in 3rd) are rare.  
But **QUACK** and **SHACK** are invalid (Q not allowed, S not allowed).  
Another ending is “O A _ C”: nothing.  
Wait – **KOJAC**? (fictional character) – but J is allowed and we have K, O, J, A, C.  However KOJAC is 5 letters and fits the pattern.  But is it a valid Scrabble/Wordle word?  Many lists include it.

A safer, dictionary-listed word is **KODAC**? No.  
Another look: **KUDAC**? No.

Let’s try **GODAC**? Again not valid.  

Real word check: **KOCAC** – no.  
**GOCAC** – no.  
**DOCAC** – no.

Wait – the only remaining legitimate word I can see is **KODAC**? Not valid.

Let me step back.  We have C forced to the 5th slot, so the word ends “…A_C”.

Actually, try **FOCAC** – not a word.

Another scan: **GODAC**? No.

Real word list small: the only actual English 5-letter word that ends in “A_C” with A in the 3rd slot is **KOJAC** (proper noun, detective from 70s TV).  Some wordlists accept it.

Alternatively, **KODAC** is not valid.  **GOJAC** no.  **POJAC** no.

Taking a more systematic approach: among 5-letter words ending *a_c* with A in 3rd:

- FLAC — not 5 letters  
- QUACK — Q disallowed  
- KNACK — K, N, A, C, K — N not allowed  
- SMACK — S not allowed  
- WHACK — W, H, A, C, K — H not allowed  
- CRACK — C, R, A, C, K — R not allowed  
- BLACK — B, L, A, C, K — B and L excluded  
- JACKS — S not allowed  
- KOJAC — K, O, J, A, C — all letters still allowed and not excluded.

KOJAC is therefore the only remaining plausible candidate from the allowed letters that fits the pattern _ _ A _ C and uses only still-allowed letters in positions 1 & 2.

Hence, next guess:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,knack,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to gain as much information as possible about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that cover a wide range of possibilities to maximize the feedback received. Common starting words include those with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, and E. This combination provides a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. It can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the target word has:
- An A in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Does not use any of S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next are common ones not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong second guess is one that also uses common letters, so I’ll use C, R, H, M, etc. A word that fits is “CHARM”:
- A is 3rd ✓
- Uses C, H, R, M (none of S, L, T, E)

<guess>CHARM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHARM -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 3 and none of {S, L, T, E} appear anywhere in the word.

2. CHARM → C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)  
   ⇒ C is in the word but not in first position.  
   ⇒ H, R, M are not in the word at all.

So constraints so far:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters not used: {S, L, T, E, H, R, M}
- Letter known to be present: C (not in position 1)

Next word must:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Include C somewhere other than position 1.
- Only use letters NOT in the excluded list.

Good still-available letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

A word that satisfies these: BIANCA uses too many letters. We need five letters exactly.

Try “CABIN”:
- A in 3 ✓
- C is present and not in position 1 ✓
- B, I, N are still allowed ✓

Check exclusions: none of {S, L, T, E, H, R, M} appear in CABIN. ✓

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHARM -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)
Guess 3: CABIN -> FEEDBACK: C(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s distill what we now know.

1. Position 3 is A (fixed).
   Word pattern: _ _ A _ _

2. Letters confirmed absent:
   S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N

3. Letters confirmed present but placed wrongly:
   - C: must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT at position 1 or 2 (because in CABIN it was at position 1 and got “-” feedback).
   - A: appears somewhere, but we already know it’s fixed at position 3, so the “-” on A in CABIN is irrelevant for our purposes (it just tells us A isn’t also at position 2).

So C must go in position 4 or 5.

4. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
   C, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

5. Need a 5-letter word with:
   - _ _ A _ _
   - Contains C in position 4 or 5.
   - Only uses letters from the allowed set.

Candidate positions for C:
   Either _ _ A C _  or _ _ A _ C

Scanning common words fitting these rules:
   _ _ A C _ : e.g., “VACAY” (Y allowed) but Y not ruled out, but V is okay.
   _ _ A _ C : e.g., “PODAC” is not a word.

“VACAY” is common (slang for vacation) and fits the pattern:
   V (allowed), A (pos 3 ✓), C (pos 4 ✓), Y (allowed), and all other letters allowed.

<guess>VACAY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHARM -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) M(x)
Guess 3: CABIN -> FEEDBACK: C(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) N(-)
Guess 4: VACAY -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(-) C(-) A(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list all the hard facts we now have.

Known pattern: _ _ A _ _   (A locked in position 3)

Letters **excluded** from the word (they have all received “x” or are ruled out by placement):
- From SLATE: S, L, T, E  
- From CHARM: H, R, M  
- From CABIN: B, I, N  
- From VACAY: V, Y  

Therefore the remaining alphabet is:
C, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z

Letters **confirmed present** but **mis-placed**:
- C (from CHARM and CABIN and VACAY: each time a “-”) – so C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (those spots have already been tried).  
  The only position still open for C is position 5.

Therefore the pattern is now: _ _ A _ C

We must pick two more letters from the still-allowed set {D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z} for positions 1 and 2.

Choosing common English consonant pairs, one good candidate is:

F, O → FO_A_C → F O A D C (FOADC is not a word)  
D, O → D O A _ C → D O A D C (also invalid)  
G, O → G O A _ C → G O A D C (invalid)  
K, O → K O A _ C → K O A D C (invalid)  
P, O → P O A _ C → P O A D C (invalid)  
D, U → D U A _ C → D U A D C (invalid)  
P, U → P U A _ C → P U A D C (invalid)  
F, U → F U A _ C → F U A D C (invalid)  
J, U → J U A _ C → J U A D C (invalid)

Wait, let’s rethink.  We have only these letters allowed in positions 1 and 2: D, F, G, J, K, O, P, U, W, Z.  
We need a **real 5-letter English word** of the form * * A * C that uses only those letters.

Scanning possibilities:
- PODAC – not a word  
- GODAC – not a word  
- DUADC – not a word  
- KODAC – not a word  
- JUADC – not a word  
- **KUDAC** – not a word  
- **GODAC** – still not a word  
- **FUDAC** – not a word  

Hold on: let’s search systematically for real words * * A * C with letters from {D,F,G,J,K,O,P,U,W,Z} in positions 1 and 2.

Real English words ending in “AC” (with A in 3rd) are rare.  
But **QUACK** and **SHACK** are invalid (Q not allowed, S not allowed).  
Another ending is “O A _ C”: nothing.  
Wait – **KOJAC**? (fictional character) – but J is allowed and we have K, O, J, A, C.  However KOJAC is 5 letters and fits the pattern.  But is it a valid Scrabble/Wordle word?  Many lists include it.

A safer, dictionary-listed word is **KODAC**? No.  
Another look: **KUDAC**? No.

Let’s try **GODAC**? Again not valid.  

Real word check: **KOCAC** – no.  
**GOCAC** – no.  
**DOCAC** – no.

Wait – the only remaining legitimate word I can see is **KODAC**? Not valid.

Let me step back.  We have C forced to the 5th slot, so the word ends “…A_C”.

Actually, try **FOCAC** – not a word.

Another scan: **GODAC**? No.

Real word list small: the only actual English 5-letter word that ends in “A_C” with A in the 3rd slot is **KOJAC** (proper noun, detective from 70s TV).  Some wordlists accept it.

Alternatively, **KODAC** is not valid.  **GOJAC** no.  **POJAC** no.

Taking a more systematic approach: among 5-letter words ending *a_c* with A in 3rd:

- FLAC — not 5 letters  
- QUACK — Q disallowed  
- KNACK — K, N, A, C, K — N not allowed  
- SMACK — S not allowed  
- WHACK — W, H, A, C, K — H not allowed  
- CRACK — C, R, A, C, K — R not allowed  
- BLACK — B, L, A, C, K — B and L excluded  
- JACKS — S not allowed  
- KOJAC — K, O, J, A, C — all letters still allowed and not excluded.

KOJAC is therefore the only remaining plausible candidate from the allowed letters that fits the pattern _ _ A _ C and uses only still-allowed letters in positions 1 & 2.

Hence, next guess:

Let’s update our constraints from every previous guess.

1. Known pattern: _ _ A _ _  (A fixed in position 3)

2. Letters permanently excluded (x feedback or impossible placement):
   S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N, V, Y, O, J, C

3. From KOJAC feedback:
   - K(✓) – K is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
   - J(x) – J is NOT in the word (already listed above).
   - A(-) – already fixed in position 3, so this simply confirms it’s not elsewhere.
   - C(-) – C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already excluded positions 1,2,3,4), so the only remaining possibility is position 5. However, now C is also excluded from position 5 (feedback C(-) in position 5), so C **cannot** be anywhere in the word. This means C is actually excluded.

4. Recalculating exclusions:
   All letters now excluded: S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N, V, Y, O, J, C
   Remaining available letters: A (already fixed at 3), D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Z

5. Current pattern after KOJAC feedback:
   - Position 1: K (✓)
   - Position 3: A (✓)
   - Positions 2, 4, 5: must be selected from remaining allowed letters {D, F, G, P, U, W, Z}, without repeats.

6. We need a 5-letter English word matching:
   K _ A _ _
   with letters chosen only from {D, F, G, P, U, W, Z} for positions 2,4,5.

7. Scanning possible combinations:
   - K D A D _ → invalid (repeat D)
   - K D A F _ → KDAFD (non-word)
   - K D A U _ → KDAFU (non-word)
   - K D A G _ → KDAG_ (non-word)

   - K Z A F _ → KZAF_ (non-word)
   - K Z A G _ → KZAG_ (non-word)

8. Real English word check:
   We need a word starting with K, second letter from {D,F,G,P,U,W,Z}, A in 3rd, and 4th and 5th letters from the same set.

   Real words that fit:
   - KNAVE → N excluded
   - KRAFT → R excluded
   - KAPUT → P, U allowed, but A already fixed in 3rd, so not KAPUT.
   - KADIS → S excluded
   - KEDGE → E excluded
   - KAGAN → G allowed, but N excluded
   - KARAT → R excluded
   - KABAR → B excluded
   - KABOB → B excluded
   - KADIS → D, I, S excluded
   - KAURI → U, R, I excluded
   - KAIFU → F, U allowed, but I excluded
   - KAGOU → G, O, U allowed, but O excluded
   - KAPOK → P, O, K allowed, but O excluded
   - KAPPA → P, P, A allowed, but double P is allowed, so KAPPA could fit if P is allowed. However P is in our allowed set {D,F,G,P,U,W,Z}.
   - KAPPA is a valid word.

   KAPPA: letters K, A, P, P, A.
   - K is at position 1 ✓
   - A is at position 3 ✓
   - P is allowed in positions 2,4,5
   - No excluded letters used.

   Another candidate: KOPPA (Greek letter), but O is excluded.
   Another: KAPUT, but position 4 U, 5 T – T excluded.
   KAPOK: position 4 O – excluded.
   KAPPA seems to be the only valid word remaining.

Therefore, the next guess is KAPPA.

<guess>KAPPA</guess>",KAPPA,"Let’s update our constraints from every previous guess.

1. Known pattern: _ _ A _ _  (A fixed in position 3)

2. Letters permanently excluded (x feedback or impossible placement):
   S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N, V, Y, O, J, C

3. From KOJAC feedback:
   - K(✓) – K is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
   - J(x) – J is NOT in the word (already listed above).
   - A(-) – already fixed in position 3, so this simply confirms it’s not elsewhere.
   - C(-) – C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already excluded positions 1,2,3,4), so the only remaining possibility is position 5. However, now C is also excluded from position 5 (feedback C(-) in position 5), so C **cannot** be anywhere in the word. This means C is actually excluded.

4. Recalculating exclusions:
   All letters now excluded: S, L, T, E, H, R, M, B, I, N, V, Y, O, J, C
   Remaining available letters: A (already fixed at 3), D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Z

5. Current pattern after KOJAC feedback:
   - Position 1: K (✓)
   - Position 3: A (✓)
   - Positions 2, 4, 5: must be selected from remaining allowed letters {D, F, G, P, U, W, Z}, without repeats.

6. We need a 5-letter English word matching:
   K _ A _ _
   with letters chosen only from {D, F, G, P, U, W, Z} for positions 2,4,5.

7. Scanning possible combinations:
   - K D A D _ → invalid (repeat D)
   - K D A F _ → KDAFD (non-word)
   - K D A U _ → KDAFU (non-word)
   - K D A G _ → KDAG_ (non-word)
   - K F A D _ → KFAD_ (non-word)
   - K F A G _ → KFAG_ (non-word)
   - K G A D _ → KGAD_ (non-word)
   - K G A F _ → KGAF_ (non-word)
   - K P A D _ → KPAD_ (non-word)
   - K P A G _ → KPAG_ (non-word)
   - K U A D _ → KUAD_ (non-word)
   - K U A F _ → KUAF_ (non-word)
   - K U A G _ → KUAG_ (non-word)
   - K W A D _ → KWAD_ (non-word)
   - K W A F _ → KWAF_ (non-word)
   - K W A G _ → KWAG_ (non-word)
   - K Z A D _ → KZAD_ (non-word)
   - K Z A F _ → KZAF_ (non-word)
   - K Z A G _ → KZAG_ (non-word)

8. Real English word check:
   We need a word starting with K, second letter from {D,F,G,P,U,W,Z}, A in 3rd, and 4th and 5th letters from the same set.

   Real words that fit:
   - KNAVE → N excluded
   - KRAFT → R excluded
   - KAPUT → P, U allowed, but A already fixed in 3rd, so not KAPUT.
   - KADIS → S excluded
   - KEDGE → E excluded
   - KAGAN → G allowed, but N excluded
   - KARAT → R excluded
   - KABAR → B excluded
   - KABOB → B excluded
   - KADIS → D, I, S excluded
   - KAURI → U, R, I excluded
   - KAIFU → F, U allowed, but I excluded
   - KAGOU → G, O, U allowed, but O excluded
   - KAPOK → P, O, K allowed, but O excluded
   - KAPPA → P, P, A allowed, but double P is allowed, so KAPPA could fit if P is allowed. However P is in our allowed set {D,F,G,P,U,W,Z}.
   - KAPPA is a valid word.

   KAPPA: letters K, A, P, P, A.
   - K is at position 1 ✓
   - A is at position 3 ✓
   - P is allowed in positions 2,4,5
   - No excluded letters used.

   Another candidate: KOPPA (Greek letter), but O is excluded.
   Another: KAPUT, but position 4 U, 5 T – T excluded.
   KAPOK: position 4 O – excluded.
   KAPPA seems to be the only valid word remaining.

Therefore, the next guess is KAPPA.",Guess 6: KAPPA -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) A(-) P(x) P(x) A(-),FAIL
