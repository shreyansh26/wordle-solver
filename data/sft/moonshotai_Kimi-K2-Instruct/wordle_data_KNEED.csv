For the first guess, I want to use a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information gained. The most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these without repeating letters. 

Possible good first guesses include:
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) without any repeats.

3. Thus, any remaining candidate must have E in the 4th spot and only use letters that have not yet been ruled out.

– Second position: same set as above  
– Third position: same set as above

A few high-frequency consonants not yet used: N, D, C, H, K, B, G, F, P.  
We need a valid English word of the form ▢ ▢ ▢ E ▢ using only these letters.

Candidate words that fit:

- BERRY – B, E, R, R, Y … but R is ruled out
- PENCE – P, E, N, C, E … double E again

- BEDGE – not a valid word
- FENCE – F, E, N, C, E … double E

3. Thus, any remaining candidate must have E in the 4th spot and only use letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Letters still allowed (and common):  
– First position: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
– Second position: same set as above  
– Third position: same set as above  
– Fifth position: same set as above  

We have not yet tried **N** or **D** or **C**, for example.  
A few high-frequency consonants not yet used: N, D, C, H, K, B, G, F, P.  
We need a valid English word of the form ▢ ▢ ▢ E ▢ using only these letters.

Candidate words that fit:
- NEEDY – uses N, E, E, D, Y (but double E, and we don’t know if double letters are allowed; also Y is still allowed)
- BERRY – B, E, R, R, Y … but R is ruled out
- PENCE – P, E, N, C, E … double E again
- CREEK – C, R, E, E, K … has R
- GEESE – G, E, E, S, E … has S
- PENNE – P, E, N, N, E … double N and double E
- BEDGE – not a valid word
- FENCE – F, E, N, C, E … double E
- WEDGE – W, E, D, G, E … double E
- HENCE – H, E, N, C, E … double E

Looking for single-E words with E strictly in 4th place:
- CUBED – but U, B, D – U and B never tested yet; D is allowed; but word has D in position 4? no, D is 4th? Wait: C U B E D – E is 4th. Ruled‐out letters: none of C, U, B, D are in {R,A,I,S,M,O,T,L}. Seems valid.
- HUNKE – not a word
- PUKED – P, U, K, E, D — all letters allowed (none ruled out except already excluded set); valid word
- BUSED – B, U, S, E, D … has S
- LUVED – not a word
- NUKED – N, U, K, E, D – valid word, no ruled-out letters

“NUKED” seems strong: N, U, K, E, D – all letters still legal, E in 4th position.

Let’s parse the new feedback for NUKED:

N(-)  – N is in the word but NOT in 1st position.  
U(x)  – U is NOT in the word.  
K(-)  – K is in the word but NOT in 3rd position.  
E(✓) – E is in the 4th position (already known).  
D(✓) – D is in the 5th position (new, exact match).

Current constraints:

1. Word pattern: ▢ ▢ ▢ E D   (E fixed at 4th, D fixed at 5th)
2. Must contain N (but not 1st) and K (but not 3rd).
3. Cannot contain: R, A, I, S, M, O, T, L, U.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-placed E and D).

So we need a 5-letter English word ending in ED, with E in 4th and D in 5th, containing N somewhere among positions 2–5 (but not 1st) and containing K somewhere among positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4th is E, 5th is D, so K must be in 1st or 2nd).

Also, no ruled-out letters may appear.

We already have:

1st letter: allowed set (no R,A,I,S,M,O,T,L,U)  
2nd letter: same set  
3rd letter: same set  
4th: E (fixed)  
5th: D (fixed)

Candidate words:

- KN…ED: KN is common start, but “KN” followed by a single letter and “ED” – e.g., KNEED – but that has E twice, and we only know one E exists at 4th position. “KNEED” is a valid English word meaning “to kneel”.

Check letters in KNEED:

K  – allowed, and must be present (✓)  
N  – must be present, and here it’s at 2nd (allowed)  
E  – already required at 4th (✓)  
E  – another E at 5th. But we only have confirmation of one E (at 4th). The feedback never stated how many Es exist. Since double letters are allowed, KNEED is a possibility.

Another candidate: CK is not useful; we don’t have C confirmed.

Actually, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words ending “ED” that contain both N and K, avoid ruled-out letters:

- KNEED (K N E E D) — has two Es; letters: K,N,E,D — all allowed, no forbidden letters.  
- KNAVE – doesn’t fit pattern.  
- KNEEL – doesn’t end ED.  
- KNEED is the only obvious one.

So KNEED is the only likely candidate satisfying all constraints.

But note: the feedback for NUKED only confirmed one E (at 4th position); having a second E in 5th is acceptable unless future feedback rules it out. Thus, KNEED is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be:
