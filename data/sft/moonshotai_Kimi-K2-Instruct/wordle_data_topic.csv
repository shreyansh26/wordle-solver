For the first guess in Wordle, it's generally best to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting hits. Common starting words often include vowels like A, E, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word that has a mix of these common letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.

A strong second guess that meets these criteria is “TORCH”:

Common starting words often include vowels like A, E, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word that has a mix of these common letters without repeating any. \n\nOne of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.\n- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word contains a T somewhere other than position 4 and contains none of S, L, A, or E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains T (somewhere other than position 4)\n2. Excludes S, L, A, E\n3. Uses only valid 5-letter English words\n\nGood consonants and vowels left: R, N, I, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.\n\nA strong second guess that meets these criteria is “TORCH”:\n- T is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 4)\n- O, R, C, H are all allowed letters\n- Uses common letters and two new vowels (O) plus high-frequency consonants (R, C, H)\n\n<guess>TORCH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: TORCH -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) R(x) C(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on TORCH:\n\n- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct position 1.\n- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position 2.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.\n- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 4.\n- H(x) – H is not in the word at all.\n\nSo far we know:\n1.

Current known facts (after 3 guesses):
1. The word starts with T O _ _ _.
2. C is in position 5 (from TONIC feedback: C(✓)).
3. I is in position 4 (from TONIC feedback: I(✓)).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, R, H, N.
5. So the pattern is now locked to: T O _ I C.

We only need to find a single letter for position 3. Allowed letters exclude all the ones listed above plus any already used in the locked positions. Remaining common consonants: D, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Scanning the pattern T O _ I C:
- T O D I C – ""TODIC"" isn’t a valid English word.
- T O G I C – ""TOGIC"" isn’t a valid English word.
- T O K I C – ""TOKIC"" isn’t a valid English word.
- T O M I C – ""TOMIC"" isn’t a standard word.
- T O P I C – ""TOPIC"" is a valid English word.
- T O U I C – invalid.
- T O V I C – invalid.
- T O W I C – invalid.
- T O Y I C – invalid.

Only ""TOPIC"" meets all constraints.
