For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word uses five different common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. Based on English letter frequency, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Another good option is ""RAISE"" which includes R, A, I, S, E. 

I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better because it includes the very common E and S at the end, and R at the start covers another frequent letter. Also, having I in the middle tests another vowel.

Let me go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
   Eliminates: R, A, I, S  
   E exists somewhere but **not** in position 5.

2. TONEY → T(x) O(-) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)  
   Eliminates: T, Y  
   Confirms: E is in position 4 and **correct** there.  
   Also tells us O and N are in the word but in wrong positions (positions 2 and 3 in TONEY).

So far we know:
- Word is _ _ _ E _ (E fixed in position 4).
- Must include O and N somewhere other than positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Must not include any of R, A, I, S, T, Y.

Letters still allowed (excluding the six eliminated): B, C, D, E (fixed), F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N (must be used), O (must be used), P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have to place O and N somewhere in the first three positions (since position 4 is E and position 5 is still open). Example pattern:  
Position choices:  
1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   ? ? ? E ?  
with O and N occupying two of positions 1,2,3.

A high-information next guess would test new consonants while placing O and N in fresh spots.  
Example: putting O in 1 and N in 3 gives O _ N E _. We need to pick a consonant for position 2 and 5 that hasn’t been used. G and L are common and unused. Let’s try:

O G N E L – but G and L seem reasonable, and both positions 2 and 5 are untested for these letters.

Another quick check: “L” is common in position 5. “G” hasn’t been tested. So O G N E L seems safe.

Therefore, I’ll choose OGNEL – wait, that’s “OGNEL” which is not a valid English word. I need to pick an actual word.

Better option: “CONED” – but D is okay, yet that would put O in 2 (already ruled out via TONEY feedback).  
Next idea: “PONED” – P is fine, O in 1, N in 3. “PONED” is valid.  
Or “BONED” – same logic. “BONED” is a common word.

Both “BONED” and “PONED” fit. I’ll pick “BONED” because B is very common to test.

Positions:
1: B (new letter)
2: O (must be somewhere, placed here)
3: N (must be somewhere, placed here)

Summary of all clues so far:

1. Letters eliminated: R, A, I, S, T, Y, B
2. E is confirmed in position 4 (✓).
3. O and N are both in the word but **must** be in positions 1 or 5 (because in TONEY they were in 2 & 3 [wrong positions], and in BONED they were again in 2 & 3 [still wrong]).  
   Therefore:  
   – O is either in 1 or 5.  
   – N is either in 1 or 5.  
   – They cannot both be in 1, so one is in 1 and the other in 5.

So the pattern must be:  
( O or N )  _  _  E  ( N or O )

We need a common English word of the form:
C1 _ _ E C5
with {C1, C5} = {O, N} in some order, and the middle letters drawn only from the still-untested, non-eliminated set:
{C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z}

Trying the two possible arrangements:

- If 1st = O and 5th = N → O _ _ E N  
  Fill positions 2 & 3 from the legal pool.  
  Candidate: O + C + H + E + N → OCHEN – not valid.  
  O + G + L + E + N → OGLEN – not valid.  
  O + D + D + E + N – repeat D and invalid.  
  O + P + E + E + N – invalid.  
  Closest real word: OLDEN (but L is fine, O-L-D-E-N).  
  OLDEN: check letters: O, L, D, E, N – all allowed.

- If 1st = N and 5th = O → N _ _ E O  
  Candidate: N + U + D + E + O → NUDEO – not valid.  
  N + I + C + E + O – I eliminated.  
  N + E + W + E + O – repeat E.  
  N + U + L + E + O – not a word.  
  N + E + V + E + O – repeat E.  
  Real word: NEWEL – but W and L okay, but NEWEL is valid, but let’s verify.  
  NEWEL – letters N, E, W, E, L – repeated E is fine (E is known), but it has E in position 2 which is allowed.

However, OLDEN seems more straightforward, uses all-new middle letters, and is a common word.

Check OLDEN:
O in 1 (new position), L and D in 2 & 3 (new letters), E in 4 (correct), N in 5 (new position).  
No eliminated letters are used.  
OLDEN is a valid English word (archaic/poetic for “to make old,” or adjective).

Therefore OLDEN is a good fourth guess.
