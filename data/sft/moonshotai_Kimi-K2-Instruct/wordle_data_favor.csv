For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally cover letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess because it includes:
- C: a common consonant
- R: another common consonant
- A: a common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination should help identify several key letters or their positions early on.

The feedback tells us:

- R – in the word, but not in position 2 (-)  
- A – in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- N – not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Must contain R and A somewhere (not in the positions we used).
2. Cannot contain C, N, or E.
3. Has five letters.

We need a new word that re-uses R and A in new positions, avoids C/N/E, and ideally tests other common consonants/vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include S, T, L, O, I, U.

A good next guess should test several of these while placing R and A in fresh positions. “STARL” or “RATIO” come to mind, but “STARL” repeats none of the eliminated letters and keeps R and A in new spots. However, “RATIO” lets us test T and I/O as well. Between the two, “RATIO” gives us slightly broader coverage of common vowels/consonants and moves R to the front and A to position 2 (both new spots).

Therefore, I’ll go with RATIO.

4. We have not yet tested the common consonants S, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc., and the vowel U remains untested.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _  (A fixed in position 2).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: A (locked at 2) and R.
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, N, E, T, I, O, B, D, S.
4. R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because in CRANE and BARDS it was “-” in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and in RATIO it was “-” in position 1).

Remaining common consonants to test: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U  (only U is left; A is used)

We want a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has R once in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters NOT yet eliminated.
- Introduces new common letters quickly.

Possible candidates:
- FARMY  – but Y not yet tested and M is ok.
- GARUM  – but U is new, G and M ok.
- HARPY  – P and Y new, H ok.
- LARKY  – K new, L ok.
- MURGA  – but A already fixed at 2, and this has A twice which is unlikely.

The best balance is HARPY:
- H (new), A (fixed), R (must be in word), P (new), Y (new).
- R is in position 3, which we haven’t tested for R yet.

Hence, HARPY is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally cover letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess because it includes:
- C: a common consonant
- R: another common consonant
- A: a common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination should help identify several key letters or their positions early on.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- C – not in the word at all (x)
- R – in the word, but not in position 2 (-)  
- A – in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- N – not in the word at all (x)
- E – not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Must contain R and A somewhere (not in the positions we used).
2. Cannot contain C, N, or E.
3. Has five letters.

We need a new word that re-uses R and A in new positions, avoids C/N/E, and ideally tests other common consonants/vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include S, T, L, O, I, U.

A good next guess should test several of these while placing R and A in fresh positions. “STARL” or “RATIO” come to mind, but “STARL” repeats none of the eliminated letters and keeps R and A in new spots. However, “RATIO” lets us test T and I/O as well. Between the two, “RATIO” gives us slightly broader coverage of common vowels/consonants and moves R to the front and A to position 2 (both new spots).

Therefore, I’ll go with RATIO.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues we now have:

1. The letters we know are **in** the word:
   - R (but not in positions 2 or 1)
   - A (and we now know A is in position 2, because A(✓) in RATIO)

2. Letters we know are **not** in the word:
   C, N, E, T, I (all “x”)
   Also, the letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 of RATIO (R, T, I, O) gave only A(✓), so:
   - Position 1 ≠ R
   - Position 3 ≠ T
   - Position 4 ≠ I
   - Position 5 ≠ O

3. Therefore, the secret word must look like: _ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2), and it contains R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

4. We have not yet tested the common consonants S, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc., and the vowel U remains untested.

A word that satisfies:
- A is in position 2.
- R appears once, in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Uses only still-allowed letters.

One such word is “BARDS”:
- B, A, R, D, S – none are in the forbidden list.
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 3 (a new location).

Therefore BARDS is a valid next guess.

1. Confirmed facts  
   - The word is of the form _ A _ _ _ (A locked at position 2).  
   - R is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, BARDS, HARPY).  
     Therefore R must be in position 5: _ A _ _ R  
   - Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, T, I, O, B, D, S, H, P, Y.  

2. Still-legal letters  
   Consonants: F, G, K, L, M, V, W …  
   Vowels: only U is still allowed besides the fixed A.  
   (We need three more letters for slots 1, 3, 4.)

3. Building a candidate  
   - Position 1: pick a common remaining consonant → F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   - Position 3: another consonant  
   - Position 4: U (the only unused vowel) is attractive because it quickly tests the last vowel.  

   Trying L A M U R → LAMUR (not a standard English word)  
   Trying G A M U R → GAMUR (no)  
   Trying F A M U R → FAMUR (no)  
   Trying V A L U R → VALUR (no)  
   Trying M A L U R → MALUR (no)  
   Trying F A L U R → FALUR (no)  
   Trying K A L U R → KALUR (no)  
   Trying W A L U R → WALUR (no)  

   Instead, use two consonants in positions 1 & 3 and let position 4 be U:  
   F A K U R → FAKUR (no)  
   M A K U R → MAKUR (no)  
   F A G U R → FAGUR (no)  
   L A G U R → LAGUR (no)  
   G A L U R → GALUR (no)  

   The only common English word that fits _ A _ _ R with remaining letters is **FUMAR** (a variant spelling of “fumer” root, but not listed in most standard word lists).  
   The standard dictionary word that actually fits is **KUMAR** (a surname, not a common noun), but Wordle word lists usually restrict to common nouns/adjectives.  

   Hence, scan again with U in position 3:  
   _ A U _ R  
   Possible consonants for slots 1 & 4: F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   L A U G R → LAUGR (no)  
   F A U L R → FAULR (no)  
   M A U L R → MAULR (no)  
   G A U L R → GAULR (no)  

   Next best: try two consonants without U in the middle:  
   _ A L M R → ALMR? no  
   _ A L V R → ALVR? no  

   Re-examine remaining letters carefully: the only actual valid Wordle word that uses the allowed set is **FAVOR** (letters F, A, V, O, R).  
   But O has already been eliminated (RATIO feedback: O(-) means O is not in the word).  

   Re-list of **still-allowed letters**:  
   A R plus any of F G K L M V W (no U forced).  
   We need three letters from {F,G,K,L,M,V,W}.  
   Forming legal 5-letter English words ending in R with A in position 2:

   - F A K E R – E is out  
   - G A M E R – E is out  
   - L A V E R – E is out  
   - M A L E R – E is out  
   - M A L A R – A twice, okay, but A already fixed at 2 → M A L A R  
     (MALAR is a medical term—unlikely in Wordle solution list)  
   - M A G O R – O out  
   - V A L O R – O out  
   - K A L A R – uncommon  
   - K A M A R – uncommon  
   - G A L A R – uncommon  

   After scanning, the **only common 5-letter English word** that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters is **MAFAR**? No, not standard.  

   Actually, the **correct** remaining candidate that **is** in the Wordle accepted list is **MAFRA**? No, not ending in R.  

   Rechecking:  
   With pattern _ A _ _ R and allowed letters {A, F, G, K, L, M, R, V, W} (plus U), the **only** valid Wordle word is **MAFUR**? No.  

   Finally, the valid word appears to be **MAFIA**, but it ends in A, not R.  

   The oversight: I forgot to test **K** with U in position 4.  
   The correct candidate that **is** in the Wordle list: **MANOR**? But O is out.  

   After exhaustive check, the only **common English word** that fits the pattern _ A _ _ R using only still-allowed letters is **MAFIA**? No.  

   Re-scan the official Wordle answer list quickly:  
   - **MAFIA** – ends in A  
   - **MAJOR** – O out  
   - **MAKAR** – archaic  
   - **MAFIC** – C out  
   - **MARKS** – S out  
   - **MAKER** – E out  

   Now realize: we are left with **G** and **U**.  
   The word **G A M U R** is not a standard word.  

   Actually the **correct** and common word that fits is **FUGAR**? No.  

   Let me list every remaining possible pattern:

   _ A _ _ R  
   Slot 1: F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   Slot 3: same pool  
   Slot 4: same pool (or U)  

   Valid English word: **VAMAR**? No.  

   **KALAR**? No.  

   **MALAR** – exists but obscure.  

   The **only remaining common Wordle word** that actually appears in the official list is **MAJOR**, but O is forbidden.  

   Realization: I must have missed the word **MAFIA** but it doesn’t fit pattern.  

   After careful recheck, the **correct word** that fits _ A _ _ R with allowed letters is **FAVOR**, but O is out.  

   Therefore, the mistake must be in earlier elimination.  
   Reread RATIO feedback: O(-) meant O was in the word but wrong position, **NOT** that it is absent.  
   (O(-) in Wordle feedback means “letter is in word but not in this position”.)  

   Re-interpretation:
   - O(-) in Guess 2 (RATIO) means O is **present** but not in position 5.  
   - Therefore O **is** in the word, just not at the end.  
   - This changes everything: O is allowed and must appear somewhere in slots 1,3,4.

   Revised constraints:
   - Pattern _ A _ _ R (R must be at 5)  
   - Must contain O somewhere in 1,3,4  
   - Cannot use C,N,E,T,I,B,D,S,H,P,Y  

   Allowed letters: A, R, O, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, U  

   Candidate words:
   - F A O _ R → F A O _ R – need consonant for slot 4.  
     F A O L R – not a word  
   - G A O _ R – need consonant; G A O K R – no  
   - M A O _ R – M A O L R – no  
   - F A M O R – but O must be in 1,3,4; here O in 4 → F A M O R  

   The word **FAMOR**? No.  

   **GAMOR**? No.  

   **VALOR** – yes!  
   Letters: V, A, L, O, R  
   - A at 2 ✓  
   - R at 5 ✓  
   - O at 4 ✓  
   - All letters are still allowed (V, L not yet ruled out).  

   Therefore the correct next guess is **VALOR**.
</think>

<guess>VALOR</guess>",VALOR,"1. Confirmed facts  
   - The word is of the form _ A _ _ _ (A locked at position 2).  
   - R is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, BARDS, HARPY).  
     Therefore R must be in position 5: _ A _ _ R  
   - Letters already ruled out: C, N, E, T, I, O, B, D, S, H, P, Y.  

2. Still-legal letters  
   Consonants: F, G, K, L, M, V, W …  
   Vowels: only U is still allowed besides the fixed A.  
   (We need three more letters for slots 1, 3, 4.)

3. Building a candidate  
   - Position 1: pick a common remaining consonant → F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   - Position 3: another consonant  
   - Position 4: U (the only unused vowel) is attractive because it quickly tests the last vowel.  

   Trying L A M U R → LAMUR (not a standard English word)  
   Trying G A M U R → GAMUR (no)  
   Trying F A M U R → FAMUR (no)  
   Trying V A L U R → VALUR (no)  
   Trying M A L U R → MALUR (no)  
   Trying F A L U R → FALUR (no)  
   Trying K A L U R → KALUR (no)  
   Trying W A L U R → WALUR (no)  

   Instead, use two consonants in positions 1 & 3 and let position 4 be U:  
   F A K U R → FAKUR (no)  
   M A K U R → MAKUR (no)  
   F A G U R → FAGUR (no)  
   L A G U R → LAGUR (no)  
   G A L U R → GALUR (no)  

   The only common English word that fits _ A _ _ R with remaining letters is **FUMAR** (a variant spelling of “fumer” root, but not listed in most standard word lists).  
   The standard dictionary word that actually fits is **KUMAR** (a surname, not a common noun), but Wordle word lists usually restrict to common nouns/adjectives.  

   Hence, scan again with U in position 3:  
   _ A U _ R  
   Possible consonants for slots 1 & 4: F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   L A U G R → LAUGR (no)  
   F A U L R → FAULR (no)  
   M A U L R → MAULR (no)  
   G A U L R → GAULR (no)  

   Next best: try two consonants without U in the middle:  
   _ A L M R → ALMR? no  
   _ A L V R → ALVR? no  

   Re-examine remaining letters carefully: the only actual valid Wordle word that uses the allowed set is **FAVOR** (letters F, A, V, O, R).  
   But O has already been eliminated (RATIO feedback: O(-) means O is not in the word).  

   Re-list of **still-allowed letters**:  
   A R plus any of F G K L M V W (no U forced).  
   We need three letters from {F,G,K,L,M,V,W}.  
   Forming legal 5-letter English words ending in R with A in position 2:

   - F A K E R – E is out  
   - G A M E R – E is out  
   - L A V E R – E is out  
   - M A L E R – E is out  
   - M A L A R – A twice, okay, but A already fixed at 2 → M A L A R  
     (MALAR is a medical term—unlikely in Wordle solution list)  
   - M A G O R – O out  
   - V A L O R – O out  
   - K A L A R – uncommon  
   - K A M A R – uncommon  
   - G A L A R – uncommon  

   After scanning, the **only common 5-letter English word** that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters is **MAFAR**? No, not standard.  

   Actually, the **correct** remaining candidate that **is** in the Wordle accepted list is **MAFRA**? No, not ending in R.  

   Rechecking:  
   With pattern _ A _ _ R and allowed letters {A, F, G, K, L, M, R, V, W} (plus U), the **only** valid Wordle word is **MAFUR**? No.  

   Finally, the valid word appears to be **MAFIA**, but it ends in A, not R.  

   The oversight: I forgot to test **K** with U in position 4.  
   The correct candidate that **is** in the Wordle list: **MANOR**? But O is out.  

   After exhaustive check, the only **common English word** that fits the pattern _ A _ _ R using only still-allowed letters is **MAFIA**? No.  

   Re-scan the official Wordle answer list quickly:  
   - **MAFIA** – ends in A  
   - **MAJOR** – O out  
   - **MAKAR** – archaic  
   - **MAFIC** – C out  
   - **MARKS** – S out  
   - **MAKER** – E out  

   Now realize: we are left with **G** and **U**.  
   The word **G A M U R** is not a standard word.  

   Actually the **correct** and common word that fits is **FUGAR**? No.  

   Let me list every remaining possible pattern:

   _ A _ _ R  
   Slot 1: F, G, K, L, M, V, W  
   Slot 3: same pool  
   Slot 4: same pool (or U)  

   Valid English word: **VAMAR**? No.  

   **KALAR**? No.  

   **MALAR** – exists but obscure.  

   The **only remaining common Wordle word** that actually appears in the official list is **MAJOR**, but O is forbidden.  

   Realization: I must have missed the word **MAFIA** but it doesn’t fit pattern.  

   After careful recheck, the **correct word** that fits _ A _ _ R with allowed letters is **FAVOR**, but O is out.  

   Therefore, the mistake must be in earlier elimination.  
   Reread RATIO feedback: O(-) meant O was in the word but wrong position, **NOT** that it is absent.  
   (O(-) in Wordle feedback means “letter is in word but not in this position”.)  

   Re-interpretation:
   - O(-) in Guess 2 (RATIO) means O is **present** but not in position 5.  
   - Therefore O **is** in the word, just not at the end.  
   - This changes everything: O is allowed and must appear somewhere in slots 1,3,4.

   Revised constraints:
   - Pattern _ A _ _ R (R must be at 5)  
   - Must contain O somewhere in 1,3,4  
   - Cannot use C,N,E,T,I,B,D,S,H,P,Y  

   Allowed letters: A, R, O, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, U  

   Candidate words:
   - F A O _ R → F A O _ R – need consonant for slot 4.  
     F A O L R – not a word  
   - G A O _ R – need consonant; G A O K R – no  
   - M A O _ R – M A O L R – no  
   - F A M O R – but O must be in 1,3,4; here O in 4 → F A M O R  

   The word **FAMOR**? No.  

   **GAMOR**? No.  

   **VALOR** – yes!  
   Letters: V, A, L, O, R  
   - A at 2 ✓  
   - R at 5 ✓  
   - O at 4 ✓  
   - All letters are still allowed (V, L not yet ruled out).  

   Therefore the correct next guess is **VALOR**.",Guess 5: VALOR -> FEEDBACK: V(-) A(✓) L(x) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally cover letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess because it includes:
- C: a common consonant
- R: another common consonant
- A: a common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination should help identify several key letters or their positions early on.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- C – not in the word at all (x)
- R – in the word, but not in position 2 (-)  
- A – in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- N – not in the word at all (x)
- E – not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
1. Must contain R and A somewhere (not in the positions we used).
2. Cannot contain C, N, or E.
3. Has five letters.

We need a new word that re-uses R and A in new positions, avoids C/N/E, and ideally tests other common consonants/vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include S, T, L, O, I, U.

A good next guess should test several of these while placing R and A in fresh positions. “STARL” or “RATIO” come to mind, but “STARL” repeats none of the eliminated letters and keeps R and A in new spots. However, “RATIO” lets us test T and I/O as well. Between the two, “RATIO” gives us slightly broader coverage of common vowels/consonants and moves R to the front and A to position 2 (both new spots).

Therefore, I’ll go with RATIO.

<guess>RATIO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues we now have:

1. The letters we know are **in** the word:
   - R (but not in positions 2 or 1)
   - A (and we now know A is in position 2, because A(✓) in RATIO)

2. Letters we know are **not** in the word:
   C, N, E, T, I (all “x”)
   Also, the letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 of RATIO (R, T, I, O) gave only A(✓), so:
   - Position 1 ≠ R
   - Position 3 ≠ T
   - Position 4 ≠ I
   - Position 5 ≠ O

3. Therefore, the secret word must look like: _ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2), and it contains R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

4. We have not yet tested the common consonants S, L, D, G, B, M, P, etc., and the vowel U remains untested.

A word that satisfies:
- A is in position 2.
- R appears once, in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (C, N, E, T, I, O).
- Uses only still-allowed letters.

One such word is “BARDS”:
- B, A, R, D, S – none are in the forbidden list.
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 3 (a new location).

Therefore BARDS is a valid next guess.

<guess>BARDS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: BARDS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(-) D(x) S(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _  (A fixed in position 2).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: A (locked at 2) and R.
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, N, E, T, I, O, B, D, S.
4. R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because in CRANE and BARDS it was “-” in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and in RATIO it was “-” in position 1).

Remaining common consonants to test: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U  (only U is left; A is used)

We want a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has R once in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters NOT yet eliminated.
- Introduces new common letters quickly.

Possible candidates:
- FARMY  – but Y not yet tested and M is ok.
- GARUM  – but U is new, G and M ok.
- HARPY  – P and Y new, H ok.
- LARKY  – K new, L ok.
- MURGA  – but A already fixed at 2, and this has A twice which is unlikely.

The best balance is HARPY:
- H (new), A (fixed), R (must be in word), P (new), Y (new).
- R is in position 3, which we haven’t tested for R yet.

Hence, HARPY is a good next guess.

3. Building a candidate  
   - Position 1: pick a common remaining consonant → F, G, K, L, M, V, W

Let’s extract what we now know:

1. Fixed letters
   - Position 2 = A (given ✓ in every guess since Guess 2)
   - Position 4 = O (given ✓ in VALOR)
   - Position 5 = R (given ✓ in VALOR)

   So the pattern is: _ A _ O R

2. Letters still unused / un-eliminated
   - Must contain R (already placed at 5) and O (already placed at 4)
   - Still-allowable letters:  
     Consonants: F, G, K, M, W (all others are now ruled out)  
     Vowels: U (all others are now ruled out)

   Therefore the only missing slot is position 1 (first letter) and position 3.  
   The letters we can still use are F, G, K, M, W, U.

3. Building words that fit _ A _ O R with the remaining letters
   - Position 1 and 3 must be chosen from {F, G, K, M, W, U}, with no repeats and no conflicts.
   - Possible combinations:
     – F A G O R  (FAGOR – not a common English word)
     – F A M O R  (FAMOR – not a word)
     – G A F O R  (GAFOR – no)
     – G A M O R  (GAMOR – no)
     – K A M O R  (KAMOR – no)
     – M A K O R  (MAKOR – no)
     – M A W O R  (MAWOR – no)
     – W A G O R  (WAGOR – no)
     – W A M O R  (WAMOR – no)
     – U is a vowel; placing it in position 1 or 3:
        – U A G O R  (UAGOR – no)
        – G A U O R  (GAUOR – no)
        – M A U O R  (MAUOR – no)
        – F A U O R  (FAUOR – no)

   The only remaining **actual English word** from the Wordle dictionary that fits the pattern and letters is **MAJOR**:
   – M-A-J-O-R
   – J was not tested yet, but none of J, Z, X, Q has been explicitly eliminated.  
   – Checking J against past feedback: it never appeared, so it is still possible.

   However, “J” was never ruled out by previous “x” marks.  
   But “J” is not in the previously eliminated list.

   Yet, we have to stay within the still-allowed set we derived: F, G, K, M, W, U.  
   There is no J in that set.

   Re-examine the still-allowed letters carefully:
   From all feedback, every letter not yet given an “x” is still possible.  
   We have NOT received an “x” for J, so J is still allowed.

   Therefore, **MAJOR** is a valid candidate.

   Let’s double-check:
   – M: never appeared before → allowed  
   – A: ✓ fixed at 2  
   – J: never tested → allowed  
   – O: ✓ fixed at 4  
   – R: ✓ fixed at 5  

   No conflicts.  
   MAJOR is a real 5-letter English word.

So the next (and almost certainly final) guess is MAJOR.
