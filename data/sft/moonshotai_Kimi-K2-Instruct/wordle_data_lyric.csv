### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It covers multiple vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- It has no repeating letters, giving us 5 distinct letters to test
- This will help identify which letters are present/absent and their possible positions

- R is not in positions 2 or 4

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s choose a word that:
1. Places C and R into new candidate positions.
2. Introduces several common untested letters (e.g., L, I, D, U).

A good candidate is “DRULC” but I don’t think that’s a valid English word.

From the new feedback:

1. C(-) – C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
2. U(x) – U is not in the word at all.
3. R(✓) – R is in the word and is correctly placed in position 3.
4. L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position.
5. Y(-) – Y is in the word but in the wrong position.

Updated constraints:
- Word must be of the form: _ _ R _ _
- Must contain C, L, Y (but C not in 1, L not in 4, Y not in 5)
- Cannot contain A, E, N, S, P, O, T, U
- Letters left to test/place: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need:
- Position 1: any letter except C, R, (already fixed), and the banned ones
- Position 2: must be one of C, L, Y (since they are in the word but misplaced)
- Position 3: R (locked)
- Position 4: must be one of C, L, Y
- Position 5: must be one of C, L, Y

Possible pattern:
- Position 2, 4, 5 must be filled with C, L, Y in some order, with no repeats.

Let’s try placing C in position 2, L in position 4, Y in position 5:
Form: _ C R L Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends with RLY and starts with a consonant. A valid word is ""CRILY"" – but that’s not a valid English word. Another possibility: ""FCRLY"" – no.

Let’s try C in position 5, L in position 2, Y in position 4:
Form: _ L R Y C – ""FLRYC"" – no.

Next: L in position 2, C in position 4, Y in position 5:
Form: _ L R C Y – ""BLRCY"" – no.

Next: Y in position 2, L in position 4, C in position 5:
Form: _ Y R L C – ""BYRLC"" – no.

Next: Y in position 2, C in position 4, L in position 5:
Form: _ Y R C L – ""FYRCL"" – no.

Next: C in position 2, Y in position 4, L in position 5:
Form: _ C R Y L – ""BCRYL"" – no.

Next: L in position 2, Y in position 4, C in position 5:
Form: _ L R Y C – ""FLRYC"" – no.

Hmm, none of these combinations with just C, L, Y seem to form a valid word. We need to introduce new letters.

Since we have to place C, L, Y in positions 1,2,4,5 (excluding position 3 which is R), and position 1 cannot be C, we need to use new consonants in some positions.

Let’s try placing C in position 4 (since it can't be 1 or 3), L in position 2, and Y in position 5:
Form: _ L R C Y – ""GLRCY"" – no.

Wait, let's think of real words that fit _ _ R _ _ with C, L, Y in the remaining positions.

Possible word: ""DURLY"" – but U is banned.
""FIRLY"" – I is allowed, but not sure if ""FIRLY"" is a word.
""GIRLY"" – is a valid word, let's check:
G I R L Y
- G: new letter, allowed
- I: new letter, allowed
- R: in position 3 (correct)
- L: in position 4 - but feedback says L is in the word but wrong position. In CURLY, L was in position 4, and feedback was L(-) meaning it's in the word but not position 4. So position 4 is wrong for L, meaning position 4 is okay for other letters.
- Y: in position 5 - but feedback says Y is in the word but not position 5 (from CURLY where Y was in 5 and got Y(-)). So position 5 is wrong for Y.

Thus ""GIRLY"" cannot have Y in position 5.

Next idea: ""LYRIC"" – but C must be in word, and in LYRIC C is in position 5, which is allowed (C not forbidden in 5). Also:
L Y R I C
- L is in position 1: allowed (was in 4 before, now in 1)
- Y is in position 2: allowed (was in 5 before, now in 2)
- R is in 3 (correct)
- I is new and allowed
- C is in 5: allowed (was in 1 before, now in 5)

""LYRIC"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Contains C, L, Y, R
- R is in position 3 (correct)
- C not in 1 (it's in 5) – satisfies C(-) from guess 3
- L not in 4 (it's in 1) – satisfies L(-) from guess 3
- Y not in 5 (it's in 2) – satisfies Y(-) from guess 3
- No banned letters
