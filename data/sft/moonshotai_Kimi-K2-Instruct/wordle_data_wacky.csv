For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which covers most common vowels
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are unique, maximizing information gain
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good initial information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S, and E are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The letter A appears somewhere in the word, but not in the first position.
- R, O, S, and E do not appear at all.

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Contains A in a different position (and only once, since we don’t know if A is doubled).
2. Introduces new consonants and vowels not yet tested (like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

I’ll choose a word that includes some high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet: B, I, N, T, U. The word ""UNTIL"" fits:
- It has U and I (new vowels).
- It has N, T, L (new consonants).
- It places A nowhere (since A is not in this word), but the feedback will help confirm if the other letters are present.
  
However, since we know A is in the word (from the feedback), we must include A in the next guess. Let’s instead pick a word that includes A in a different position and tests new letters.

A good word is ""AINTB""? No, that’s not valid. How about ""FAINT""? 
- Contains A in position 2 (not 1).
- Tests F, I, N, T (all new).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

This seems optimal for gathering the next set of clues.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).\n\nThe word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:\n1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which covers most common vowels\n2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)\n3. All letters are unique, maximizing information gain\n4. It\'s a valid 5-letter English word\n\nThis should give us good initial information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- R, O, S, and E are NOT in the word (x).\n\nSo far we know:\n- The letter A appears somewhere in the word, but not in the first position.\n- R, O, S, and E do not appear at all.\n\nNext, I want to pick a word that:\n1. Contains A in a different position (and only once, since we don’t know if A is doubled).\n2. Introduces new consonants and vowels not yet tested (like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, etc.).\n3. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.\n\nI’ll choose a word that includes some high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet: B, I, N, T, U. The word ""UNTIL"" fits:\n- It has U and I (new vowels).\n- It has N, T, L (new consonants).\n- It places A nowhere (since A is not in this word), but the feedback will help confirm if the other letters are present.\n  \nHowever, since we know A is in the word (from the feedback), we must include A in the next guess. Let’s instead pick a word that includes A in a different position and tests new letters.\n\nA good word is ""AINTB""? No, that’s not valid. How about ""FAINT""? \n- Contains A in position 2 (not 1).\n- Tests F, I, N, T (all new).\n- Avoids R, O, S, E.\n\nThis seems optimal for gathering the next set of clues.\n\n<guess>FAINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary of what we now know:\n\n1.

So far we know:
1. Pattern: _ A _ _ _  (A is fixed in position 2).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, F, I, N, T, B, L, D.
3. Letters still allowed: C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and vowels U (since A is already used and E,I,O are out).

We also just learned Y is in the word, but we don’t know where yet. Because Y appeared as ‘-’ in BALDY, it must be in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is really: _ A _ _ _ with Y somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a new word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Uses Y in a different position (1, 3, or 4) to test where it fits.
- Introduces as many new, still-allowed letters as possible.

Among the remaining consonants, C, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W are good candidates.

Let’s try “YACHT”:
- Y in position 1 (new test for Y).
- A in position 2 (matches requirement).
- C, H, T – but T is already excluded, so this won’t work.

Next option: “CAMPY” – but P is fine, but Y is in position 5, which we know is wrong.

Then “GAMBY” – but B is excluded.

Next choice: “HAPPY” – but P is fine, Y is in 5 (invalid).

Next: “MANGY” – but N is excluded.

Next: “PAGLY” – not a valid word.

Next: “VAMPY” – not valid.

Next: “WACKY” – W, C, K, Y are all allowed, A is fixed, and Y is in position 4 (new position to test).

This seems valid and fits all constraints.
