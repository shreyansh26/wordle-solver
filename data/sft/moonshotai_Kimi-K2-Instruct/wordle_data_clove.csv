Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word that contains many frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- Common vowels: A, I, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

An alternative could be ""ADIEU"" for more vowels, but I prefer ""RAISE"" as it balances vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all NOT in the word (x).  
- Only E is present and is in the correct (fifth) position (✓).

So the target word ends in E and cannot contain R, A, I, or S.  
My next guess should introduce new consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, M …  
Good vowels left: O, U …

Choosing a word that uses several of these unused letters while keeping the known “_ _ _ _ E” pattern is best.  
“TOWER” is short and provides T, O, W plus the known E.  
Other candidates like “BLOKE” or “DUNGE” would also work, but “TOWER” feels solid for an early guess.

So far we know:

1. E is in the word and is in the final position (from RAISE).
2. O is in the word but NOT in the second position (from TOWER).
3. R, A, I, S, T, W are NOT in the word at all (x in both guesses).

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, and must contain O somewhere in positions 1-4.

I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Gives me as many new consonants as possible to narrow things down.

Good candidates:
- ""OZONE"" – but repeats O and Z is less common.
- ""HOMIE"" – uses H, M, I (but I is already ruled out).
- ""POCHE"" – uses P, C, H.
- ""PHONE"" – uses P, H, N.
- ""MOLVE"" – but V and M are okay, but ""MOLVE"" isn't a valid word.
- ""BONCE"" – uses B, N, C, and has O in position 2.

""BONCE"" seems like a good choice because it tests B, N, C, and O in a new position (position 2).

So O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
And C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but position 5 is E), so C must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, O (but we already know O is in the word).

We need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O (positions 1, 3, or 4 allowed).
- Contains C in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Some possible candidates:
- COBLE (C, O, B, L, E) – B is ruled out.
- COMBE – B is ruled out.
- CHOKE – C, H, O, K, E. This looks valid: C is allowed in spot 1. O is allowed in spot 3. H and K are new letters.
- CLOVE – L, O, V, E – C is in spot 1, O in spot 2 but O cannot be in spot 2 (from BONCE feedback), so this is invalid.
- POKEE – P, O, K, E, E – repeats E and has no C.
- DOZEN – D, O, Z, E, N – N is ruled out.
- HOMER – R is ruled out.

""CHOKE"" seems to satisfy all constraints:
- C is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (allowed).
- Uses new letters H and K.
- Ends with E.
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore, CHOKE is the next logical guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,clove,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word that contains many frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- Common vowels: A, I, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

An alternative could be ""ADIEU"" for more vowels, but I prefer ""RAISE"" as it balances vowels and consonants well.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all NOT in the word (x).  
- Only E is present and is in the correct (fifth) position (✓).

So the target word ends in E and cannot contain R, A, I, or S.  
My next guess should introduce new consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, M …  
Good vowels left: O, U …

Choosing a word that uses several of these unused letters while keeping the known “_ _ _ _ E” pattern is best.  
“TOWER” is short and provides T, O, W plus the known E.  
Other candidates like “BLOKE” or “DUNGE” would also work, but “TOWER” feels solid for an early guess.

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

1. E is in the word and is in the final position (from RAISE).
2. O is in the word but NOT in the second position (from TOWER).
3. R, A, I, S, T, W are NOT in the word at all (x in both guesses).

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, and must contain O somewhere in positions 1-4.

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B C D F G H J K L M N P Q U V X Y Z.

I want a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Gives me as many new consonants as possible to narrow things down.

Good candidates:
- ""OZONE"" – but repeats O and Z is less common.
- ""HOMIE"" – uses H, M, I (but I is already ruled out).
- ""POCHE"" – uses P, C, H.
- ""PHONE"" – uses P, H, N.
- ""MOLVE"" – but V and M are okay, but ""MOLVE"" isn't a valid word.
- ""BONCE"" – uses B, N, C, and has O in position 2.

""BONCE"" seems like a good choice because it tests B, N, C, and O in a new position (position 2).

Let me check validity: ""BONCE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (British slang for ""head"").
