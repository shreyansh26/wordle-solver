For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses most vowels but lacks consonants)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It uses 3 of the 5 most common vowels (A, I, E)
2. It includes two very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words
4. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z

This should help efficiently narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

All the letters in RAISE – R, A, I, S, E – were rejected except that the feedback for R is “-”.  
“-” means the letter R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1.

- R is in the word (not in position 1)
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all

Therefore the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, E
- DOES contain R somewhere in positions 2-5
- Has 4 other letters different from A, I, S, E

For a second guess, I want:
1. To place R in a new spot (not position 1) to test its correct position.
2. To include new, common consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out.
3. To avoid A, I, S, E entirely.

Let's re-assemble all the facts:

1. From ROUND feedback:
   - R(-)  → R is still in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - O(-)  → O is still in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - N(-)  → N is still in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - U(x) and D(x) → U and D are NOT in the word at all.

2. From earlier rounds:
   - Letters already eliminated: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D  
   - Letters confirmed present: R, O, N (each with restrictions on where they can sit).

3. Known positions and restrictions:
   - R cannot be in position 1 (R(-) in ROUND).
   - R is confirmed to be in position 2 in FRONT, so contradiction here? Wait…

Wait, there’s a contradiction or misinterpretation. Let me re-read the feedback chain carefully.

- Guess 1 (RAISE) → R(-) means R exists but not in pos 1.  
- Guess 2 (FRONT) → R(✓) means R is in position 2.  
- Guess 3 (ROUND) → R(-) means R exists but not in position 1.  

These three statements are consistent: R is in the word and is confirmed to be in position 2 (from FRONT), and the (-) in ROUND is simply reiterating it’s not in position 1 (which we already know from RAISE). So position 2 is locked to R.

Similarly:
- O is present.
   - In FRONT, O is in position 3 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 3.
   - In ROUND, O is in position 2 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 2.
   So valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5.

- N is present.
   - In FRONT, N is in position 4 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 4.
   - In ROUND, N is in position 5 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 5.
   So valid positions for N: 1, 2, 3. But position 2 is taken by R, so N must be in 1 or 3.

4. Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (position 2 is R).

We need to fill:
   - Position 1: N or other (but N could be here)
   - Position 3: N or other
   - Position 4: O or other
   - Position 5: O or other

Letters allowed: any not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y. Vowels left: only O is confirmed; any others? We've eliminated A, I, E, U, so only O is confirmed. Y could be a vowel.

Let's try to place N and O and see what forms a valid word.

Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 4.  
Pattern: N R _ O _  
Third letter (position 3) and fifth letter (position 5) must be consonants from remaining set.

Let’s try N R C O M → NRCOM (not a word), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R M O B → NRM OB (no), etc.

Option 2: N in position 3, O in position 1.  
Pattern: O R N _ _  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Possible: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

Option 3: N in position 3, O in position 5.  
Pattern: _ R N _ O  
First letter and fourth letter to fill.  
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N G O → CRNGO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), P R N G O → PRNGO (no), H R N G O → HRNGO (no), M R N G O → MRNGO (no), L R N G O → LRNGO (no), etc.

Option 4: N in position 1, O in position 5.  
Pattern: N R _ _ O  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Example: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B H O → NRBHO (no), etc.

Hmm, these aren’t yielding valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a different consonant, and N is in position 3.

Let’s list possible words with R in position 2, N in 1 or 3, O in 1, 4, or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

Looking for valid English 5-letter words:
- R is in position 2.
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- If N is in 1, O can be in 4 or 5:
   - N R O C K → NROCK (valid word)
   - N R C O W → NRCOW (no), N R M O W → NRMOW (no), etc.
   - N R O M P → NROMP (no), etc.
- If N is in 3, O must be in 1 or 4 or 5:
   - C R N O W → CRNOW (no)
   - B R O N G → BRONG (no)
   - P R O N G → PRONG (valid word: P R O N G)

""PRONG"" and ""NROCK"" both fit. But NROCK is less common; PRONG is a solid English word meaning a pointed part of a fork, etc.

Let’s verify PRONG against constraints:
- P: new, allowed.
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3. But O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → O cannot be in position 3. So PRONG is invalid because it places O in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Next: NROCK:
- N: position 1. Allowed (N can be in 1 or 3).
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 → but O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → same issue, invalid.

Oops, both PRONG and NROCK place O in position 3, which is forbidden.

Next possibility: place O in position 4 or 5, N in 1 or 3.

Try N in 1, O in 4:
N R _ O _
Need letters for 3 and 5 from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
Example: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R C O G → NRCOG (no), etc.

N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R C O H → NRCOH (no), etc.

N R M O C → NRMOC (no), etc.

Seems no valid word here.

Try N in 3, O in 5:
_ R N _ O
First letter and fourth letter to fill.
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), etc.

B R O N G → BRONG (no), etc.

Hmm, let’s try C R O N Y → CRONY (valid word), but O is position 3 → forbidden.

M R O N G → MRONG (no), etc.

Next: L R O N G → LRONG (no), etc.

Next: C R O N G → CRONG (no), etc.

Next: B R O N Y → BRONY (no), etc.

Next: N in 3, O in 1:
O R N _ _
Need 4 and 5:
O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), etc.

This path isn’t yielding. Let me re-examine.

Perhaps N is in 1, O in 5:
N R _ _ O
Need 3 and 4:
N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R Y C O → NRYCO (no), etc.

N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.

N R B G O → NRBGO (no), etc.

No valid words here.

Wait, let’s re-examine positions more carefully.

We have:
- Position 2: R
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from remaining set. Valid word: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc. No valid.
2. O in 4, N in 1: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: need consonants. Possible: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R C O K → NRCOK (no), N R B O K → NRBO K (no), etc.
3. O in 4, N in 3: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: consonants. Possible: B R N O K → BRNOK (no), C R N O K → CRNOK (no), G R N O K → GRNOK (no), P R N O K → PRNOK (no), etc.
4. O in 5, N in 1: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: consonants. Possible: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
5. O in 5, N in 3: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: consonants. Possible: C R N B O → CRNBO (no), B R N C O → BRNCO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Still nothing. Let me list all valid 5-letter words with R in position 2, and check which fit constraints.

Valid English words with R in position 2:
- BRAIN (invalid: A, I)
- BRAND (invalid: A, D)
- BRAWN (invalid: A, W not tested but A is out)
- BREED (invalid: E, D)
- BRICK (invalid: I, C, K)
- BRONC (invalid: O in pos 3, C)
- BRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- BROOD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- BROOK (invalid: O in pos 3, K)
- BROOM (invalid: O in pos 3, M)
- CRANE (invalid: A, E)
- CRANK (invalid: A, K)
- CRONY (invalid: O in pos 3, Y)
- CROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- DRONE (invalid: D, E)
- GROAN (invalid: O in pos 3, A)
- GROIN (invalid: O in pos 3, I)
- GROPE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, P)
- GROSS (invalid: O in pos 3, S)
- GROVE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, V)
- GROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- PROBE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, B)
- PRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- PROUD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- PROWL (invalid: O in pos 3, L)
- PROXY (invalid: O in pos 3, X, Y)
- TRUNK (invalid: T, U)
- TRUCK (invalid: T, U, C)
- etc.

None satisfy the constraints. The key issue is that O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and N in 1 or 3, while R is fixed in 2.

Let me try constructing explicitly:

Possible patterns:
- N R _ O _ (N1, R2, O4): need 3 and 5 consonants. Possible letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O H → NR COH (no)
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no)
   - N R G O Y → NRGOY (no)
   - N R B O Y → NRBOY (no)
   - N R M O Y → NRMOY (no)
- N R _ _ O (N1, R2, O5): need 3 and 4 consonants.
   - N R B C O → NRBCO (no)
   - N R C B O → NRCBO (no)
   - N R C G O → NRGCO (no)
   - N R C H O → NRCHO (no)
   - N R C M O → NRMCO (no)
- _ R N O _ (N3, R2, O4): need 1 and 5 consonants.
   - C R N O B → CRNOB (no)
   - B R N O C → BRNOC (no)
   - G R N O C → GRNOC (no)
   - P R N O C → PRNOC (no)
- O R N _ _ (O1, R2, N3): need 4 and 5 consonants.
   - O R N C H → ORNCH (no)
   - O R N C K → ORNCK (no)
   - O R N B C → ORNBC (no)
   - O R N G Y → ORNGY (no)
- _ R _ N O (N4, O5): but N cannot be in 4 (from FRONT N(-) in 4), so invalid.
- _ R _ O N (O4, N5): but N cannot be in 5 (from ROUND N(-) in 5), so invalid.

This exhaustive check suggests no valid English word fits under these constraints. This implies an inconsistency or oversight. Rechecking:

Wait, in FRONT, N was in position 4 and got (-), so N cannot be in 4.
In ROUND, N was in position 5 and got (-), so N cannot be in 5.
Thus N can only be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, O:
- In FRONT, O was in position 3 and got (-), so O cannot be in 3.
- In ROUND, O was in position 2 and got (-), so O cannot be in 2.
Thus O can be in 1, 4, or 5.

R is confirmed in position 2 from FRONT (R(✓)).

Thus possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from allowed set (B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y).
   Possible: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), O R N C Y → ORNCY (no), O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N B C → ORNBC (no), etc. No valid word.
2. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: e.g., N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), etc.
3. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Same as case 1.
5. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
6. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits these constraints is ""BRONC"" (short for bronco), but:
- BRONC: B, R, O, N, C
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → but O cannot be in 3 (from FRONT), so invalid.

Similarly, ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""PRONG"":
- P, R, O, N, G
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""GROIN"":
- G, R, O, I, N → I is out.

""GROAN"":
- G, R, O, A, N → A is out.

""GRONK"":
- G, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONK"":
- C, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""BRONK"":
- B, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E → E is out.

It appears no standard 5-letter English word satisfies all constraints. However, upon rechecking, I realize I missed a simpler possibility: ""CRONY"" was invalid due to O in 3, but let’s think of words where O is in 1 or 4 or 5 and N in 1 or 3.

Possible valid word: ""BROWN"" – but O in 3 → invalid.

Wait, let me think of ""HORNY"":
- H, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → but R must be in 2 → invalid.

""CORNY"":
- C, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""CORNY"" is invalid for R position.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - N in 1, O in 2, R in 3 → R must be in 2 → invalid.

""NORMS"":
- N, O, R, M, S → S is out.

""NORIA"":
- A is out.

""NORTH"":
- T is out.

""NORMA"":
- A is out.

""NORGE"":
- E is out.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""NORCO"":
- C, O → but O in 3 → invalid.

""NORMS"" → S out.

""NORRY"":
- R in 2, O in 3 → invalid.

""NORGY"":
- R in 3 → invalid.

""NORGE"":
- E out.

""NORCO"":
- O in 3 → invalid.

It seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

- R is in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓)).
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- N must be in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D.

Thus possible patterns:
1. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Need 3 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R G O Y → NRGOY (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O H → NR COH (no), N R C O M → NR COM (no), etc.
2. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Need 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.
3. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Need 4 and 5: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Need 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
5. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Need 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

After exhaustive search, the only plausible valid word fitting all constraints is ""BROCH"", but it's not standard. Realizing this, I must have missed a word.

Upon deeper reflection, the word ""BROCH"" is not recognized, but ""BROCK"" is (a name). However, ""BROCK"":
- B, R, O, C, K
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid (cannot be in 3).

Similarly, ""CROCK"":
- C, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""GROCK"":
- G, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""MROCK"":
- Not valid.

Realizing the constraints are very tight, the only remaining possible word that fits is ""CRONY"", but O is in 3 → invalid.

This suggests the constraints may have been misinterpreted. Rechecking FRONT and ROUND feedback:

- FRONT: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)
   - R(✓) → R is in position 2. This is definitive.
   - O(✓) → O is in position 3. This contradicts the earlier assumption that O was (-) in FRONT.

Wait, the feedback for FRONT is:
F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)

This means:
- R is in position 2 ✓
- O is in position 3 ✓
- N is in word but not in position 4 (-)

Thus the word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N somewhere in 1, 3, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1 or 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ _ or _ R _ _ N or N R O _ _

But from ROUND feedback:
R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - R(-) → R is not in position 1 (but we know from FRONT it's in 2, so this is redundant)
   - O(-) → O is not in position 2 (but it's in 3 from FRONT, so redundant)
   - N(-) → N is not in position 4
   - U and D are out.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N in 1 or 4 or 5 (but not 3 since O is there, and not 4 from ROUND)
   - So N must be in 1 or 5.
- Other letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.

Possible patterns:
1. N in 1: N R O _ _
   Need 4 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   Valid word: N R O C K → NROCK (valid, though uncommon)
2. N in 5: _ R O _ N
   Need 1 and 4: consonants.
   Valid word: B R O C N → BROCN (no), C R O B N → CROBN (no), G R O C N → GROCN (no), etc.
   Or: B R O W N → BROWN (valid):
      - B, R, O, W, N
      - R in 2 ✓
      - O in 3 ✓
      - N in 5 ✓
      - W is new and allowed (not forbidden)
      - Other letters: B allowed, W allowed.

""BROWN"" fits perfectly:
- B: new, allowed
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 ✓
- W: new, allowed
- N: position 5 ✓

No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D) are present.

Thus the correct next guess is ""BROWN"".

</think>

After re-evaluating the feedback carefully, the word must have:
- R in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓))
- O in position 3 (from FRONT O(✓))
- N somewhere in the word but not in position 4 (from FRONT N(-) and ROUND N(-))
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

The only valid English word that fits is ""BROWN"".

<guess>BROWN</guess>",BROWN,"Let's re-assemble all the facts:

1. From ROUND feedback:
   - R(-)  → R is still in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - O(-)  → O is still in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - N(-)  → N is still in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - U(x) and D(x) → U and D are NOT in the word at all.

2. From earlier rounds:
   - Letters already eliminated: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D  
   - Letters confirmed present: R, O, N (each with restrictions on where they can sit).

3. Known positions and restrictions:
   - R cannot be in position 1 (R(-) in ROUND).
   - R is confirmed to be in position 2 in FRONT, so contradiction here? Wait…

Wait, there’s a contradiction or misinterpretation. Let me re-read the feedback chain carefully.

- Guess 1 (RAISE) → R(-) means R exists but not in pos 1.  
- Guess 2 (FRONT) → R(✓) means R is in position 2.  
- Guess 3 (ROUND) → R(-) means R exists but not in position 1.  

These three statements are consistent: R is in the word and is confirmed to be in position 2 (from FRONT), and the (-) in ROUND is simply reiterating it’s not in position 1 (which we already know from RAISE). So position 2 is locked to R.

Similarly:
- O is present.
   - In FRONT, O is in position 3 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 3.
   - In ROUND, O is in position 2 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 2.
   So valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5.

- N is present.
   - In FRONT, N is in position 4 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 4.
   - In ROUND, N is in position 5 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 5.
   So valid positions for N: 1, 2, 3. But position 2 is taken by R, so N must be in 1 or 3.

4. Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (position 2 is R).

We need to fill:
   - Position 1: N or other (but N could be here)
   - Position 3: N or other
   - Position 4: O or other
   - Position 5: O or other

Letters allowed: any not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y. Vowels left: only O is confirmed; any others? We've eliminated A, I, E, U, so only O is confirmed. Y could be a vowel.

Let's try to place N and O and see what forms a valid word.

Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 4.  
Pattern: N R _ O _  
Third letter (position 3) and fifth letter (position 5) must be consonants from remaining set.

Let’s try N R C O M → NRCOM (not a word), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R M O B → NRM OB (no), etc.

Option 2: N in position 3, O in position 1.  
Pattern: O R N _ _  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Possible: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

Option 3: N in position 3, O in position 5.  
Pattern: _ R N _ O  
First letter and fourth letter to fill.  
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N G O → CRNGO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), P R N G O → PRNGO (no), H R N G O → HRNGO (no), M R N G O → MRNGO (no), L R N G O → LRNGO (no), etc.

Option 4: N in position 1, O in position 5.  
Pattern: N R _ _ O  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Example: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B H O → NRBHO (no), etc.

Hmm, these aren’t yielding valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a different consonant, and N is in position 3.

Let’s list possible words with R in position 2, N in 1 or 3, O in 1, 4, or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

Looking for valid English 5-letter words:
- R is in position 2.
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- If N is in 1, O can be in 4 or 5:
   - N R O C K → NROCK (valid word)
   - N R C O W → NRCOW (no), N R M O W → NRMOW (no), etc.
   - N R O M P → NROMP (no), etc.
- If N is in 3, O must be in 1 or 4 or 5:
   - C R N O W → CRNOW (no)
   - B R O N G → BRONG (no)
   - P R O N G → PRONG (valid word: P R O N G)

""PRONG"" and ""NROCK"" both fit. But NROCK is less common; PRONG is a solid English word meaning a pointed part of a fork, etc.

Let’s verify PRONG against constraints:
- P: new, allowed.
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3. But O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → O cannot be in position 3. So PRONG is invalid because it places O in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Next: NROCK:
- N: position 1. Allowed (N can be in 1 or 3).
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 → but O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → same issue, invalid.

Oops, both PRONG and NROCK place O in position 3, which is forbidden.

Next possibility: place O in position 4 or 5, N in 1 or 3.

Try N in 1, O in 4:
N R _ O _
Need letters for 3 and 5 from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
Example: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R C O G → NRCOG (no), etc.

N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R C O H → NRCOH (no), etc.

N R M O C → NRMOC (no), etc.

Seems no valid word here.

Try N in 3, O in 5:
_ R N _ O
First letter and fourth letter to fill.
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), etc.

B R O N G → BRONG (no), etc.

Hmm, let’s try C R O N Y → CRONY (valid word), but O is position 3 → forbidden.

M R O N G → MRONG (no), etc.

Next: L R O N G → LRONG (no), etc.

Next: C R O N G → CRONG (no), etc.

Next: B R O N Y → BRONY (no), etc.

Next: N in 3, O in 1:
O R N _ _
Need 4 and 5:
O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), etc.

This path isn’t yielding. Let me re-examine.

Perhaps N is in 1, O in 5:
N R _ _ O
Need 3 and 4:
N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R Y C O → NRYCO (no), etc.

N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.

N R B G O → NRBGO (no), etc.

No valid words here.

Wait, let’s re-examine positions more carefully.

We have:
- Position 2: R
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from remaining set. Valid word: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc. No valid.
2. O in 4, N in 1: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: need consonants. Possible: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R C O K → NRCOK (no), N R B O K → NRBO K (no), etc.
3. O in 4, N in 3: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: consonants. Possible: B R N O K → BRNOK (no), C R N O K → CRNOK (no), G R N O K → GRNOK (no), P R N O K → PRNOK (no), etc.
4. O in 5, N in 1: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: consonants. Possible: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
5. O in 5, N in 3: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: consonants. Possible: C R N B O → CRNBO (no), B R N C O → BRNCO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Still nothing. Let me list all valid 5-letter words with R in position 2, and check which fit constraints.

Valid English words with R in position 2:
- BRAIN (invalid: A, I)
- BRAND (invalid: A, D)
- BRAWN (invalid: A, W not tested but A is out)
- BREED (invalid: E, D)
- BRICK (invalid: I, C, K)
- BRONC (invalid: O in pos 3, C)
- BRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- BROOD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- BROOK (invalid: O in pos 3, K)
- BROOM (invalid: O in pos 3, M)
- CRANE (invalid: A, E)
- CRANK (invalid: A, K)
- CRONY (invalid: O in pos 3, Y)
- CROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- DRONE (invalid: D, E)
- GROAN (invalid: O in pos 3, A)
- GROIN (invalid: O in pos 3, I)
- GROPE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, P)
- GROSS (invalid: O in pos 3, S)
- GROVE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, V)
- GROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- PROBE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, B)
- PRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- PROUD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- PROWL (invalid: O in pos 3, L)
- PROXY (invalid: O in pos 3, X, Y)
- TRUNK (invalid: T, U)
- TRUCK (invalid: T, U, C)
- etc.

None satisfy the constraints. The key issue is that O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and N in 1 or 3, while R is fixed in 2.

Let me try constructing explicitly:

Possible patterns:
- N R _ O _ (N1, R2, O4): need 3 and 5 consonants. Possible letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O H → NR COH (no)
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no)
   - N R G O Y → NRGOY (no)
   - N R B O Y → NRBOY (no)
   - N R M O Y → NRMOY (no)
- N R _ _ O (N1, R2, O5): need 3 and 4 consonants.
   - N R B C O → NRBCO (no)
   - N R C B O → NRCBO (no)
   - N R C G O → NRGCO (no)
   - N R C H O → NRCHO (no)
   - N R C M O → NRMCO (no)
- _ R N O _ (N3, R2, O4): need 1 and 5 consonants.
   - C R N O B → CRNOB (no)
   - B R N O C → BRNOC (no)
   - G R N O C → GRNOC (no)
   - P R N O C → PRNOC (no)
- O R N _ _ (O1, R2, N3): need 4 and 5 consonants.
   - O R N C H → ORNCH (no)
   - O R N C K → ORNCK (no)
   - O R N B C → ORNBC (no)
   - O R N G Y → ORNGY (no)
- _ R _ N O (N4, O5): but N cannot be in 4 (from FRONT N(-) in 4), so invalid.
- _ R _ O N (O4, N5): but N cannot be in 5 (from ROUND N(-) in 5), so invalid.

This exhaustive check suggests no valid English word fits under these constraints. This implies an inconsistency or oversight. Rechecking:

Wait, in FRONT, N was in position 4 and got (-), so N cannot be in 4.
In ROUND, N was in position 5 and got (-), so N cannot be in 5.
Thus N can only be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, O:
- In FRONT, O was in position 3 and got (-), so O cannot be in 3.
- In ROUND, O was in position 2 and got (-), so O cannot be in 2.
Thus O can be in 1, 4, or 5.

R is confirmed in position 2 from FRONT (R(✓)).

Thus possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from allowed set (B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y).
   Possible: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), O R N C Y → ORNCY (no), O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N B C → ORNBC (no), etc. No valid word.
2. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: e.g., N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), etc.
3. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Same as case 1.
5. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
6. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits these constraints is ""BRONC"" (short for bronco), but:
- BRONC: B, R, O, N, C
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → but O cannot be in 3 (from FRONT), so invalid.

Similarly, ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""PRONG"":
- P, R, O, N, G
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""GROIN"":
- G, R, O, I, N → I is out.

""GROAN"":
- G, R, O, A, N → A is out.

""GRONK"":
- G, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONK"":
- C, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""BRONK"":
- B, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E → E is out.

It appears no standard 5-letter English word satisfies all constraints. However, upon rechecking, I realize I missed a simpler possibility: ""CRONY"" was invalid due to O in 3, but let’s think of words where O is in 1 or 4 or 5 and N in 1 or 3.

Possible valid word: ""BROWN"" – but O in 3 → invalid.

Wait, let me think of ""HORNY"":
- H, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → but R must be in 2 → invalid.

""CORNY"":
- C, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""CORNY"" is invalid for R position.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - N in 1, O in 2, R in 3 → R must be in 2 → invalid.

""NORMS"":
- N, O, R, M, S → S is out.

""NORIA"":
- A is out.

""NORTH"":
- T is out.

""NORMA"":
- A is out.

""NORGE"":
- E is out.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""NORCO"":
- C, O → but O in 3 → invalid.

""NORMS"" → S out.

""NORRY"":
- R in 2, O in 3 → invalid.

""NORGY"":
- R in 3 → invalid.

""NORGE"":
- E out.

""NORCO"":
- O in 3 → invalid.

It seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

- R is in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓)).
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- N must be in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D.

Thus possible patterns:
1. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Need 3 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R G O Y → NRGOY (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O H → NR COH (no), N R C O M → NR COM (no), etc.
2. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Need 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.
3. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Need 4 and 5: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Need 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
5. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Need 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

After exhaustive search, the only plausible valid word fitting all constraints is ""BROCH"", but it's not standard. Realizing this, I must have missed a word.

Upon deeper reflection, the word ""BROCH"" is not recognized, but ""BROCK"" is (a name). However, ""BROCK"":
- B, R, O, C, K
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid (cannot be in 3).

Similarly, ""CROCK"":
- C, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""GROCK"":
- G, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""MROCK"":
- Not valid.

Realizing the constraints are very tight, the only remaining possible word that fits is ""CRONY"", but O is in 3 → invalid.

This suggests the constraints may have been misinterpreted. Rechecking FRONT and ROUND feedback:

- FRONT: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)
   - R(✓) → R is in position 2. This is definitive.
   - O(✓) → O is in position 3. This contradicts the earlier assumption that O was (-) in FRONT.

Wait, the feedback for FRONT is:
F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)

This means:
- R is in position 2 ✓
- O is in position 3 ✓
- N is in word but not in position 4 (-)

Thus the word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N somewhere in 1, 3, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1 or 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ _ or _ R _ _ N or N R O _ _

But from ROUND feedback:
R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - R(-) → R is not in position 1 (but we know from FRONT it's in 2, so this is redundant)
   - O(-) → O is not in position 2 (but it's in 3 from FRONT, so redundant)
   - N(-) → N is not in position 4
   - U and D are out.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N in 1 or 4 or 5 (but not 3 since O is there, and not 4 from ROUND)
   - So N must be in 1 or 5.
- Other letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.

Possible patterns:
1. N in 1: N R O _ _
   Need 4 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   Valid word: N R O C K → NROCK (valid, though uncommon)
2. N in 5: _ R O _ N
   Need 1 and 4: consonants.
   Valid word: B R O C N → BROCN (no), C R O B N → CROBN (no), G R O C N → GROCN (no), etc.
   Or: B R O W N → BROWN (valid):
      - B, R, O, W, N
      - R in 2 ✓
      - O in 3 ✓
      - N in 5 ✓
      - W is new and allowed (not forbidden)
      - Other letters: B allowed, W allowed.

""BROWN"" fits perfectly:
- B: new, allowed
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 ✓
- W: new, allowed
- N: position 5 ✓

No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D) are present.

Thus the correct next guess is ""BROWN"".After re-evaluating the feedback carefully, the word must have:
- R in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓))
- O in position 3 (from FRONT O(✓))
- N somewhere in the word but not in position 4 (from FRONT N(-) and ROUND N(-))
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

The only valid English word that fits is ""BROWN"".",Guess 4: BROWN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,crown,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses most vowels but lacks consonants)

Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It uses 3 of the 5 most common vowels (A, I, E)
2. It includes two very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words
4. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z

This should help efficiently narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All the letters in RAISE – R, A, I, S, E – were rejected except that the feedback for R is “-”.  
“-” means the letter R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1.

So now I know:
- R is in the word (not in position 1)
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all

Therefore the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, E
- DOES contain R somewhere in positions 2-5
- Has 4 other letters different from A, I, S, E

For a second guess, I want:
1. To place R in a new spot (not position 1) to test its correct position.
2. To include new, common consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out.
3. To avoid A, I, S, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants/vowels: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, H, etc.

A balanced word that uses several new letters and places R in position 2 is “FRONT”:
- F, O, N, T have not been tested yet.
- R is moved to position 2.

If I get feedback on R’s position or any hits on the new letters, I can narrow further.

<guess>FRONT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)):
- R is present but NOT in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

From Guess 2 (FRONT → F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)):
- R is now confirmed in position 2.
- O is present but NOT in position 3.
- N is present but NOT in position 4.
- F and T are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
- Known letters and their positions: R at position 2.
- Known letters but unknown positions: O and N (but O ≠ 3, N ≠ 4).
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T.
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We need three more letters, none of which are A, I, S, E, F, T. Common remaining consonants/vowels: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y.
We also need to place O and N somewhere other than positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Possible placements:
- O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- N could be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let's try placing O and N and pick a fifth letter. A good strategy is to test new common letters. Let's try placing O in position 1 and N in position 5, and use a common consonant like D in position 3 and U in position 4.

This gives us the word ""ROUND"":
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- O is in position 1 (new placement).
- U is a new vowel.
- N is in position 5 (new placement).
- D is a new consonant.

This tests new letters and positions for O and N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's re-assemble all the facts:

1. From ROUND feedback:
   - R(-)  → R is still in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - O(-)  → O is still in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - N(-)  → N is still in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - U(x) and D(x) → U and D are NOT in the word at all.

2. From earlier rounds:
   - Letters already eliminated: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D  
   - Letters confirmed present: R, O, N (each with restrictions on where they can sit).

3. Known positions and restrictions:
   - R cannot be in position 1 (R(-) in ROUND).
   - R is confirmed to be in position 2 in FRONT, so contradiction here? Wait…

Wait, there’s a contradiction or misinterpretation. Let me re-read the feedback chain carefully.

- Guess 1 (RAISE) → R(-) means R exists but not in pos 1.  
- Guess 2 (FRONT) → R(✓) means R is in position 2.  
- Guess 3 (ROUND) → R(-) means R exists but not in position 1.  

These three statements are consistent: R is in the word and is confirmed to be in position 2 (from FRONT), and the (-) in ROUND is simply reiterating it’s not in position 1 (which we already know from RAISE). So position 2 is locked to R.

Similarly:
- O is present.
   - In FRONT, O is in position 3 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 3.
   - In ROUND, O is in position 2 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 2.
   So valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5.

- N is present.
   - In FRONT, N is in position 4 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 4.
   - In ROUND, N is in position 5 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 5.
   So valid positions for N: 1, 2, 3. But position 2 is taken by R, so N must be in 1 or 3.

4. Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (position 2 is R).

We need to fill:
   - Position 1: N or other (but N could be here)
   - Position 3: N or other
   - Position 4: O or other
   - Position 5: O or other

Letters allowed: any not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y. Vowels left: only O is confirmed; any others? We've eliminated A, I, E, U, so only O is confirmed. Y could be a vowel.

Let's try to place N and O and see what forms a valid word.

Option 1: N in position 1, O in position 4.  
Pattern: N R _ O _  
Third letter (position 3) and fifth letter (position 5) must be consonants from remaining set.

Let’s try N R C O M → NRCOM (not a word), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R M O B → NRM OB (no), etc.

Option 2: N in position 3, O in position 1.  
Pattern: O R N _ _  
Need letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Possible: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

Option 3: N in position 3, O in position 5.  
Pattern: _ R N _ O  
First letter and fourth letter to fill.  
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N G O → CRNGO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), P R N G O → PRNGO (no), H R N G O → HRNGO (no), M R N G O → MRNGO (no), L R N G O → LRNGO (no), etc.

Option 4: N in position 1, O in position 5.  
Pattern: N R _ _ O  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Example: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B H O → NRBHO (no), etc.

Hmm, these aren’t yielding valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a different consonant, and N is in position 3.

Let’s list possible words with R in position 2, N in 1 or 3, O in 1, 4, or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

Looking for valid English 5-letter words:
- R is in position 2.
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- If N is in 1, O can be in 4 or 5:
   - N R O C K → NROCK (valid word)
   - N R C O W → NRCOW (no), N R M O W → NRMOW (no), etc.
   - N R O M P → NROMP (no), etc.
- If N is in 3, O must be in 1 or 4 or 5:
   - C R N O W → CRNOW (no)
   - B R O N G → BRONG (no)
   - P R O N G → PRONG (valid word: P R O N G)

""PRONG"" and ""NROCK"" both fit. But NROCK is less common; PRONG is a solid English word meaning a pointed part of a fork, etc.

Let’s verify PRONG against constraints:
- P: new, allowed.
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3. But O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → O cannot be in position 3. So PRONG is invalid because it places O in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Next: NROCK:
- N: position 1. Allowed (N can be in 1 or 3).
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 → but O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → same issue, invalid.

Oops, both PRONG and NROCK place O in position 3, which is forbidden.

Next possibility: place O in position 4 or 5, N in 1 or 3.

Try N in 1, O in 4:
N R _ O _
Need letters for 3 and 5 from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
Example: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R C O G → NRCOG (no), etc.

N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R C O H → NRCOH (no), etc.

N R M O C → NRMOC (no), etc.

Seems no valid word here.

Try N in 3, O in 5:
_ R N _ O
First letter and fourth letter to fill.
Example: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), etc.

B R O N G → BRONG (no), etc.

Hmm, let’s try C R O N Y → CRONY (valid word), but O is position 3 → forbidden.

M R O N G → MRONG (no), etc.

Next: L R O N G → LRONG (no), etc.

Next: C R O N G → CRONG (no), etc.

Next: B R O N Y → BRONY (no), etc.

Next: N in 3, O in 1:
O R N _ _
Need 4 and 5:
O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.

O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), etc.

This path isn’t yielding. Let me re-examine.

Perhaps N is in 1, O in 5:
N R _ _ O
Need 3 and 4:
N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R Y C O → NRYCO (no), etc.

N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.

N R B G O → NRBGO (no), etc.

No valid words here.

Wait, let’s re-examine positions more carefully.

We have:
- Position 2: R
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from remaining set. Valid word: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc. No valid.
2. O in 4, N in 1: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: need consonants. Possible: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R C O K → NRCOK (no), N R B O K → NRBO K (no), etc.
3. O in 4, N in 3: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: consonants. Possible: B R N O K → BRNOK (no), C R N O K → CRNOK (no), G R N O K → GRNOK (no), P R N O K → PRNOK (no), etc.
4. O in 5, N in 1: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: consonants. Possible: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
5. O in 5, N in 3: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: consonants. Possible: C R N B O → CRNBO (no), B R N C O → BRNCO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Still nothing. Let me list all valid 5-letter words with R in position 2, and check which fit constraints.

Valid English words with R in position 2:
- BRAIN (invalid: A, I)
- BRAND (invalid: A, D)
- BRAWN (invalid: A, W not tested but A is out)
- BREED (invalid: E, D)
- BRICK (invalid: I, C, K)
- BRONC (invalid: O in pos 3, C)
- BRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- BROOD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- BROOK (invalid: O in pos 3, K)
- BROOM (invalid: O in pos 3, M)
- CRANE (invalid: A, E)
- CRANK (invalid: A, K)
- CRONY (invalid: O in pos 3, Y)
- CROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- DRONE (invalid: D, E)
- GROAN (invalid: O in pos 3, A)
- GROIN (invalid: O in pos 3, I)
- GROPE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, P)
- GROSS (invalid: O in pos 3, S)
- GROVE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, V)
- GROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)
- PROBE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, B)
- PRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)
- PROUD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)
- PROWL (invalid: O in pos 3, L)
- PROXY (invalid: O in pos 3, X, Y)
- TRUNK (invalid: T, U)
- TRUCK (invalid: T, U, C)
- etc.

None satisfy the constraints. The key issue is that O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and N in 1 or 3, while R is fixed in 2.

Let me try constructing explicitly:

Possible patterns:
- N R _ O _ (N1, R2, O4): need 3 and 5 consonants. Possible letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O H → NR COH (no)
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no)
   - N R G O Y → NRGOY (no)
   - N R B O Y → NRBOY (no)
   - N R M O Y → NRMOY (no)
- N R _ _ O (N1, R2, O5): need 3 and 4 consonants.
   - N R B C O → NRBCO (no)
   - N R C B O → NRCBO (no)
   - N R C G O → NRGCO (no)
   - N R C H O → NRCHO (no)
   - N R C M O → NRMCO (no)
- _ R N O _ (N3, R2, O4): need 1 and 5 consonants.
   - C R N O B → CRNOB (no)
   - B R N O C → BRNOC (no)
   - G R N O C → GRNOC (no)
   - P R N O C → PRNOC (no)
- O R N _ _ (O1, R2, N3): need 4 and 5 consonants.
   - O R N C H → ORNCH (no)
   - O R N C K → ORNCK (no)
   - O R N B C → ORNBC (no)
   - O R N G Y → ORNGY (no)
- _ R _ N O (N4, O5): but N cannot be in 4 (from FRONT N(-) in 4), so invalid.
- _ R _ O N (O4, N5): but N cannot be in 5 (from ROUND N(-) in 5), so invalid.

This exhaustive check suggests no valid English word fits under these constraints. This implies an inconsistency or oversight. Rechecking:

Wait, in FRONT, N was in position 4 and got (-), so N cannot be in 4.
In ROUND, N was in position 5 and got (-), so N cannot be in 5.
Thus N can only be in 1 or 3.

Similarly, O:
- In FRONT, O was in position 3 and got (-), so O cannot be in 3.
- In ROUND, O was in position 2 and got (-), so O cannot be in 2.
Thus O can be in 1, 4, or 5.

R is confirmed in position 2 from FRONT (R(✓)).

Thus possible patterns:
1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _
   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from allowed set (B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y).
   Possible: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), O R N C Y → ORNCY (no), O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N B C → ORNBC (no), etc. No valid word.
2. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Then 3 and 5: e.g., N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), etc.
3. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Then 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Same as case 1.
5. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Then 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
6. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Then 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits these constraints is ""BRONC"" (short for bronco), but:
- BRONC: B, R, O, N, C
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → but O cannot be in 3 (from FRONT), so invalid.

Similarly, ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""PRONG"":
- P, R, O, N, G
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid.

""GROIN"":
- G, R, O, I, N → I is out.

""GROAN"":
- G, R, O, A, N → A is out.

""GRONK"":
- G, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONK"":
- C, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""BRONK"":
- B, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E → E is out.

It appears no standard 5-letter English word satisfies all constraints. However, upon rechecking, I realize I missed a simpler possibility: ""CRONY"" was invalid due to O in 3, but let’s think of words where O is in 1 or 4 or 5 and N in 1 or 3.

Possible valid word: ""BROWN"" – but O in 3 → invalid.

Wait, let me think of ""HORNY"":
- H, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → but R must be in 2 → invalid.

""CORNY"":
- C, O, R, N, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""CORNY"" is invalid for R position.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - N in 1, O in 2, R in 3 → R must be in 2 → invalid.

""NORMS"":
- N, O, R, M, S → S is out.

""NORIA"":
- A is out.

""NORTH"":
- T is out.

""NORMA"":
- A is out.

""NORGE"":
- E is out.

""NORGY"":
- N, O, R, G, Y
   - R in 3 → invalid.

""NORCO"":
- C, O → but O in 3 → invalid.

""NORMS"" → S out.

""NORRY"":
- R in 2, O in 3 → invalid.

""NORGY"":
- R in 3 → invalid.

""NORGE"":
- E out.

""NORCO"":
- O in 3 → invalid.

It seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:

- R is in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓)).
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- N must be in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D.

Thus possible patterns:
1. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _
   Need 3 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R G O Y → NRGOY (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O H → NR COH (no), N R C O M → NR COM (no), etc.
2. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O
   Need 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.
3. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _
   Need 4 and 5: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.
4. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _
   Need 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.
5. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O
   Need 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.

After exhaustive search, the only plausible valid word fitting all constraints is ""BROCH"", but it's not standard. Realizing this, I must have missed a word.

Upon deeper reflection, the word ""BROCH"" is not recognized, but ""BROCK"" is (a name). However, ""BROCK"":
- B, R, O, C, K
   - R in 2 ✓
   - O in 3 → invalid (cannot be in 3).

Similarly, ""CROCK"":
- C, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""GROCK"":
- G, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.

""MROCK"":
- Not valid.

Realizing the constraints are very tight, the only remaining possible word that fits is ""CRONY"", but O is in 3 → invalid.

This suggests the constraints may have been misinterpreted. Rechecking FRONT and ROUND feedback:

- FRONT: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)
   - R(✓) → R is in position 2. This is definitive.
   - O(✓) → O is in position 3. This contradicts the earlier assumption that O was (-) in FRONT.

Wait, the feedback for FRONT is:
F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)

This means:
- R is in position 2 ✓
- O is in position 3 ✓
- N is in word but not in position 4 (-)

Thus the word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N somewhere in 1, 3, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1 or 5)
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

Thus the pattern is: _ R O _ _ or _ R _ _ N or N R O _ _

But from ROUND feedback:
R(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - R(-) → R is not in position 1 (but we know from FRONT it's in 2, so this is redundant)
   - O(-) → O is not in position 2 (but it's in 3 from FRONT, so redundant)
   - N(-) → N is not in position 4
   - U and D are out.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- N in 1 or 4 or 5 (but not 3 since O is there, and not 4 from ROUND)
   - So N must be in 1 or 5.
- Other letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.

Possible patterns:
1. N in 1: N R O _ _
   Need 4 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.
   Valid word: N R O C K → NROCK (valid, though uncommon)
2. N in 5: _ R O _ N
   Need 1 and 4: consonants.
   Valid word: B R O C N → BROCN (no), C R O B N → CROBN (no), G R O C N → GROCN (no), etc.
   Or: B R O W N → BROWN (valid):
      - B, R, O, W, N
      - R in 2 ✓
      - O in 3 ✓
      - N in 5 ✓
      - W is new and allowed (not forbidden)
      - Other letters: B allowed, W allowed.

""BROWN"" fits perfectly:
- B: new, allowed
- R: position 2 ✓
- O: position 3 ✓
- W: new, allowed
- N: position 5 ✓

No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D) are present.

Thus the correct next guess is ""BROWN"".After re-evaluating the feedback carefully, the word must have:
- R in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓))
- O in position 3 (from FRONT O(✓))
- N somewhere in the word but not in position 4 (from FRONT N(-) and ROUND N(-))
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D

The only valid English word that fits is ""BROWN"".

Known positions and restrictions:\n   - R cannot be in position 1 (R(-) in ROUND).\n   - R is confirmed to be in position 2 in FRONT, so contradiction here? Wait…\n\nWait, there’s a contradiction or misinterpretation. Let me re-read the feedback chain carefully.\n\n- Guess 1 (RAISE) → R(-) means R exists but not in pos 1.  \n- Guess 2 (FRONT) → R(✓) means R is in position 2.  \n- Guess 3 (ROUND) → R(-) means R exists but not in position 1.  \n\nThese three statements are consistent: R is in the word and is confirmed to be in position 2 (from FRONT), and the (-) in ROUND is simply reiterating it’s not in position 1 (which we already know from RAISE). So position 2 is locked to R.\n\nSimilarly:\n- O is present.\n   - In FRONT, O is in position 3 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 3.\n   - In ROUND, O is in position 2 and gets (-), meaning O is not in position 2.\n   So valid positions for O: 1, 4, 5.\n\n- N is present.\n   - In FRONT, N is in position 4 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 4.\n   - In ROUND, N is in position 5 and gets (-), meaning N is not in position 5.\n   So valid positions for N: 1, 2, 3. But position 2 is taken by R, so N must be in 1 or 3.\n\n4. Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (position 2 is R).\n\nWe need to fill:\n   - Position 1: N or other (but N could be here)\n   - Position 3: N or other\n   - Position 4: O or other\n   - Position 5: O or other\n\nLetters allowed: any not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y. Vowels left: only O is confirmed; any others? We\'ve eliminated A, I, E, U, so only O is confirmed. Y could be a vowel.\n\nLet\'s try to place N and O and see what forms a valid word.\n\nOption 1: N in position 1, O in position 4.  \nPattern: N R _ O _  \nThird letter (position 3) and fifth letter (position 5) must be consonants from remaining set.\n\nLet’s try N R C O M → NRCOM (not a word), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R M O B → NRM OB (no), etc.\n\nOption 2: N in position 3, O in position 1.  \nPattern: O R N _ _  \nNeed letters for positions 4 and 5.  \nPossible: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.\n\nOption 3: N in position 3, O in position 5.  \nPattern: _ R N _ O  \nFirst letter and fourth letter to fill.  \nExample: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N G O → CRNGO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), P R N G O → PRNGO (no), H R N G O → HRNGO (no), M R N G O → MRNGO (no), L R N G O → LRNGO (no), etc.\n\nOption 4: N in position 1, O in position 5.  \nPattern: N R _ _ O  \nNeed letters for positions 3 and 4.  \nExample: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B H O → NRBHO (no), etc.\n\nHmm, these aren’t yielding valid words. Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a different consonant, and N is in position 3.\n\nLet’s list possible words with R in position 2, N in 1 or 3, O in 1, 4, or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nLooking for valid English 5-letter words:\n- R is in position 2.\n- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n- N must be in 1 or 3.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- If N is in 1, O can be in 4 or 5:\n   - N R O C K → NROCK (valid word)\n   - N R C O W → NRCOW (no), N R M O W → NRMOW (no), etc.\n   - N R O M P → NROMP (no), etc.\n- If N is in 3, O must be in 1 or 4 or 5:\n   - C R N O W → CRNOW (no)\n   - B R O N G → BRONG (no)\n   - P R O N G → PRONG (valid word: P R O N G)\n\n""PRONG"" and ""NROCK"" both fit. But NROCK is less common; PRONG is a solid English word meaning a pointed part of a fork, etc.\n\nLet’s verify PRONG against constraints:\n- P: new, allowed.\n- R: position 2 ✓\n- O: position 3. But O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → O cannot be in position 3. So PRONG is invalid because it places O in position 3, which we know is wrong.\n\nNext: NROCK:\n- N: position 1. Allowed (N can be in 1 or 3).\n- R: position 2 ✓\n- O: position 3 → but O was (-) in FRONT (position 3) → same issue, invalid.\n\nOops, both PRONG and NROCK place O in position 3, which is forbidden.\n\nNext possibility: place O in position 4 or 5, N in 1 or 3.\n\nTry N in 1, O in 4:\nN R _ O _\nNeed letters for 3 and 5 from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.\nExample: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O B → NRCOB (no), N R C O G → NRCOG (no), etc.\n\nN R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R C O H → NRCOH (no), etc.\n\nN R M O C → NRMOC (no), etc.\n\nSeems no valid word here.\n\nTry N in 3, O in 5:\n_ R N _ O\nFirst letter and fourth letter to fill.\nExample: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), B R N G O → BRNGO (no), etc.\n\nB R O N G → BRONG (no), etc.\n\nHmm, let’s try C R O N Y → CRONY (valid word), but O is position 3 → forbidden.\n\nM R O N G → MRONG (no), etc.\n\nNext: L R O N G → LRONG (no), etc.\n\nNext: C R O N G → CRONG (no), etc.\n\nNext: B R O N Y → BRONY (no), etc.\n\nNext: N in 3, O in 1:\nO R N _ _\nNeed 4 and 5:\nO R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.\n\nO R N G Y → ORNGY (no), etc.\n\nThis path isn’t yielding. Let me re-examine.\n\nPerhaps N is in 1, O in 5:\nN R _ _ O\nNeed 3 and 4:\nN R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R Y C O → NRYCO (no), etc.\n\nN R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.\n\nN R B G O → NRBGO (no), etc.\n\nNo valid words here.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine positions more carefully.\n\nWe have:\n- Position 2: R\n- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n- N must be in 1 or 3.\n\nPossible patterns:\n1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _\n   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from remaining set. Valid word: O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc. No valid.\n2. O in 4, N in 1: N R _ O _\n   Then 3 and 5: need consonants. Possible: N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R C O K → NRCOK (no), N R B O K → NRBO K (no), etc.\n3. O in 4, N in 3: _ R N O _\n   Then 1 and 5: consonants. Possible: B R N O K → BRNOK (no), C R N O K → CRNOK (no), G R N O K → GRNOK (no), P R N O K → PRNOK (no), etc.\n4. O in 5, N in 1: N R _ _ O\n   Then 3 and 4: consonants. Possible: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C K O → NRCKO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.\n5.

Let me list all valid 5-letter words with R in position 2, and check which fit constraints.\n\nValid English words with R in position 2:\n- BRAIN (invalid: A, I)\n- BRAND (invalid: A, D)\n- BRAWN (invalid: A, W not tested but A is out)\n- BREED (invalid: E, D)\n- BRICK (invalid: I, C, K)\n- BRONC (invalid: O in pos 3, C)\n- BRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)\n- BROOD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)\n- BROOK (invalid: O in pos 3, K)\n- BROOM (invalid: O in pos 3, M)\n- CRANE (invalid: A, E)\n- CRANK (invalid: A, K)\n- CRONY (invalid: O in pos 3, Y)\n- CROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)\n- DRONE (invalid: D, E)\n- GROAN (invalid: O in pos 3, A)\n- GROIN (invalid: O in pos 3, I)\n- GROPE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, P)\n- GROSS (invalid: O in pos 3, S)\n- GROVE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, V)\n- GROWN (invalid: O in pos 3, W)\n- PROBE (invalid: O in pos 3, E, B)\n- PRONG (invalid: O in pos 3)\n- PROUD (invalid: O in pos 3, D)\n- PROWL (invalid: O in pos 3, L)\n- PROXY (invalid: O in pos 3, X, Y)\n- TRUNK (invalid: T, U)\n- TRUCK (invalid: T, U, C)\n- etc.\n\nNone satisfy the constraints. The key issue is that O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5, and N in 1 or 3, while R is fixed in 2.\n\nLet me try constructing explicitly:\n\nPossible patterns:\n- N R _ O _ (N1, R2, O4): need 3 and 5 consonants. Possible letters: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.\n   - N R C O H → NR COH (no)\n   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no)\n   - N R G O Y → NRGOY (no)\n   - N R B O Y → NRBOY (no)\n   - N R M O Y → NRMOY (no)\n- N R _ _ O (N1, R2, O5): need 3 and 4 consonants.\n   - N R B C O → NRBCO (no)\n   - N R C B O → NRCBO (no)\n   - N R C G O → NRGCO (no)\n   - N R C H O → NRCHO (no)\n   - N R C M O → NRMCO (no)\n- _ R N O _ (N3, R2, O4): need 1 and 5 consonants.\n   - C R N O B → CRNOB (no)\n   - B R N O C → BRNOC (no)\n   - G R N O C → GRNOC (no)\n   - P R N O C → PRNOC (no)\n- O R N _ _ (O1, R2, N3): need 4 and 5 consonants.\n   - O R N C H → ORNCH (no)\n   - O R N C K → ORNCK (no)\n   - O R N B C → ORNBC (no)\n   - O R N G Y → ORNGY (no)\n- _ R _ N O (N4, O5): but N cannot be in 4 (from FRONT N(-) in 4), so invalid.\n- _ R _ O N (O4, N5): but N cannot be in 5 (from ROUND N(-) in 5), so invalid.\n\nThis exhaustive check suggests no valid English word fits under these constraints. This implies an inconsistency or oversight. Rechecking:\n\nWait, in FRONT, N was in position 4 and got (-), so N cannot be in 4.\nIn ROUND, N was in position 5 and got (-), so N cannot be in 5.\nThus N can only be in 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O:\n- In FRONT, O was in position 3 and got (-), so O cannot be in 3.\n- In ROUND, O was in position 2 and got (-), so O cannot be in 2.\nThus O can be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\nR is confirmed in position 2 from FRONT (R(✓)).\n\nThus possible patterns:\n1. O in 1, N in 3: O R N _ _\n   Then 4 and 5 must be consonants from allowed set (B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y).\n   Possible: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), O R N C Y → ORNCY (no), O R N G Y → ORNGY (no), O R N B C → ORNBC (no), etc. No valid word.\n2. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _\n   Then 3 and 5: e.g., N R C O M → NRCOM (no), N R G O M → NRGOM (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), etc.\n3. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O\n   Then 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), etc.\n4. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _\n   Same as case 1.\n5. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _\n   Then 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.\n6. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O\n   Then 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits these constraints is ""BRONC"" (short for bronco), but:\n- BRONC: B, R, O, N, C\n   - R in 2 ✓\n   - O in 3 → but O cannot be in 3 (from FRONT), so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRONY"":\n- C, R, O, N, Y\n   - R in 2 ✓\n   - O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""PRONG"":\n- P, R, O, N, G\n   - R in 2 ✓\n   - O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""GROIN"":\n- G, R, O, I, N → I is out.\n\n""GROAN"":\n- G, R, O, A, N → A is out.\n\n""GRONK"":\n- G, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""CRONK"":\n- C, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""BRONK"":\n- B, R, O, N, K → O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""CRONE"":\n- C, R, O, N, E → E is out.\n\nIt appears no standard 5-letter English word satisfies all constraints. However, upon rechecking, I realize I missed a simpler possibility: ""CRONY"" was invalid due to O in 3, but let’s think of words where O is in 1 or 4 or 5 and N in 1 or 3.\n\nPossible valid word: ""BROWN"" – but O in 3 → invalid.\n\nWait, let me think of ""HORNY"":\n- H, O, R, N, Y\n   - R in 3 → but R must be in 2 → invalid.\n\n""CORNY"":\n- C, O, R, N, Y\n   - R in 3 → invalid.\n\n""CORNY"" is invalid for R position.\n\n""NORGY"":\n- N, O, R, G, Y\n   - N in 1, O in 2, R in 3 → R must be in 2 → invalid.\n\n""NORMS"":\n- N, O, R, M, S → S is out.\n\n""NORIA"":\n- A is out.\n\n""NORTH"":\n- T is out.\n\n""NORMA"":\n- A is out.\n\n""NORGE"":\n- E is out.\n\n""NORGY"":\n- N, O, R, G, Y\n   - R in 3 → invalid.\n\n""NORCO"":\n- C, O → but O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""NORMS"" → S out.\n\n""NORRY"":\n- R in 2, O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""NORGY"":\n- R in 3 → invalid.\n\n""NORGE"":\n- E out.\n\n""NORCO"":\n- O in 3 → invalid.\n\nIt seems impossible. Re-examining the constraints:\n\n- R is in position 2 (from FRONT R(✓)).\n- O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).\n- N must be in 1, 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).\n- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D.\n\nThus possible patterns:\n1. N in 1, O in 4: N R _ O _\n   Need 3 and 5: consonants from B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.\n   - N R C O Y → NRCOY (no), N R G O Y → NRGOY (no), N R B O Y → NRBOY (no), N R C O H → NR COH (no), N R C O M → NR COM (no), etc.\n2. N in 1, O in 5: N R _ _ O\n   Need 3 and 4: N R C H O → NRCHO (no), N R C G O → NRGCO (no), N R B C O → NRBCO (no), N R C M O → NRMCO (no), etc.\n3. N in 3, O in 1: O R N _ _\n   Need 4 and 5: O R N C H → ORNCH (no), O R N C K → ORNCK (no), etc.\n4. N in 3, O in 4: _ R N O _\n   Need 1 and 5: B R N O C → BRNOC (no), C R N O B → CRNOB (no), G R N O C → GRNOC (no), etc.\n5. N in 3, O in 5: _ R N _ O\n   Need 1 and 4: B R N C O → BRNCO (no), C R N B O → CRNBO (no), G R N C O → GRNCO (no), etc.\n\nAfter exhaustive search, the only plausible valid word fitting all constraints is ""BROCH"", but it\'s not standard. Realizing this, I must have missed a word.\n\nUpon deeper reflection, the word ""BROCH"" is not recognized, but ""BROCK"" is (a name). However, ""BROCK"":\n- B, R, O, C, K\n   - R in 2 ✓\n   - O in 3 → invalid (cannot be in 3).\n\nSimilarly, ""CROCK"":\n- C, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""GROCK"":\n- G, R, O, C, K → O in 3 → invalid.\n\n""MROCK"":\n- Not valid.\n\nRealizing the constraints are very tight, the only remaining possible word that fits is ""CRONY"", but O is in 3 → invalid.\n\nThis suggests the constraints may have been misinterpreted. Rechecking FRONT and ROUND feedback:\n\n- FRONT: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)\n   - R(✓) → R is in position 2. This is definitive.\n   - O(✓) → O is in position 3. This contradicts the earlier assumption that O was (-) in FRONT.\n\nWait, the feedback for FRONT is:\nF(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(-) T(x)\n\nThis means:\n- R is in position 2 ✓\n- O is in position 3 ✓\n- N is in word but not in position 4 (-)\n\nThus the word must have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: O\n- N somewhere in 1, 3, or 5 (but 3 is O, so 1 or 5)\n- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, E, F, T, U, D\n\nThus the pattern is: _ R O _ _ or _ R _ _ N or N R O _ _\n\nBut from ROUND feedback:\nR(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)\n   - R(-) → R is not in position 1 (but we know from FRONT it\'s in 2, so this is redundant)\n   - O(-) → O is not in position 2 (but it\'s in 3 from FRONT, so redundant)\n   - N(-) → N is not in position 4\n   - U and D are out.\n\nThus the word must be:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: O\n- N in 1 or 4 or 5 (but not 3 since O is there, and not 4 from ROUND)\n   - So N must be in 1 or 5.\n- Other letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from remaining consonants: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, Y.\n\nPossible patterns:\n1.
