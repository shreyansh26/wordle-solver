For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, a good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,dodgy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, a good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (marked -).

So:
- The word contains the letter O somewhere except the middle position (3).
- The remaining consonants/letters to try should avoid A, R, S, E.

Common letters still available: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, Y, U, I, etc.
I need a word that has O and avoids the forbidden letters A, R, S, E.

Good candidates: 
- ""POINT"" – has O, but I, N, T are common.
- ""CLOUD"" – has O, but uses C, L, U, D.
- ""DOING"" – has O, but uses D, I, N, G.

I'll go with ""POINT"" as it tests O in position 2 and includes common letters P, I, N, T.

- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- Letters A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T are NOT in the word (all marked x).

Remaining candidate letters (from the alphabet, excluding the 8 already ruled out):
- Vowels left: U, Y
- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word whose 2nd letter is O, and which uses none of A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Let’s think of common patterns with O in the 2nd spot:
- _ O _ _ _
Possible middle/ending consonant combinations: CK, CK, LD, LB, LM, MB, MM, ND, NG, NK, etc.

Candidate words that fit:
- BOUGH (uses B, U, G, H – all allowed)
- COULD (but D is allowed, C, O, U, L, D – but L is allowed)
- DOUGH (D, O, U, G, H – all allowed)
- FOLLY (but Y is allowed, F, O, L, L, Y – but L is allowed)
- GOULD (G, O, U, L, D – all allowed)

I’ll choose DOUGH because it tests U, G, and H, which are still in play.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, a good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. I\'ll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S.

We now know:
- Fixed pattern: D O _ _ Y
- Letters that are NOT in the word (besides all the ones eliminated earlier): B, L
- Remaining unused consonants from the alphabet: C, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z
- We need a 5-letter word of the form D O _ _ Y that uses only the still-allowed letters.

Scanning the small set of remaining consonants, the only two that can plausibly fit in positions 3 and 4 together are C and K, yielding DOCKY (rare/uncommon) or DOCKY-like forms. However, the ordinary English word that matches is DOCKY—but the dictionary word is actually DOCKY (a small boat), which is uncommon. 

The other possibilities are DOGGY (but G is already used in position 4 and was OK, but we tried DOUGH and G was in position 4 – not necessarily banned, just in the wrong spot), DOJAY, DOKEY, DOMKY, DOVEY, DOWDY, etc. But only one of these is a valid English word:  

D O C K Y – no, that's not a recognized word.  
D O M E Y – no.  
D O V E Y – no.  
D O W D Y – yes, that’s a recognized word.  

Let me check: D O W D Y – letters D, O, W, D, Y. All letters are still allowed (W is unused so far and not yet eliminated). So:

- D (✓) – correct position 1  
- O (✓) – correct position 2  
- W (unknown) – new letter  
- D (unknown) – D already allowed in position 4 or 5? Actually D has only been confirmed in position 1 and no other position has been tested with D.  
- Y (✓) – correct position 5  

This fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters. Therefore the next logical guess is:

DOWDY
