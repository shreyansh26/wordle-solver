For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in English and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting word strategies include:
- Words with multiple vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L

A good balance is ""AROSE"":
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are very common in 5-letter words
- Covers different parts of the alphabet

This should give me good information about which vowels are in the word and whether S or R are present.

What we know:

1. Letters that are in the word: R and S (both marked “in word but wrong position”).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, U, T, Y.
3. R must appear somewhere other than position 2 (from AROSE) and somewhere other than position 1 (from RUSTY).  
   Therefore R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. S must appear somewhere other than position 4 (from AROSE) and somewhere other than position 3 (from RUSTY).  
   Therefore S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
5. Vowels left to try: I (only common vowel not yet ruled out).

Consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with:
- Exactly one R and one S (because only those two letters have been confirmed so far).
- At least one vowel (I is the only vowel left that hasn’t been eliminated).
- R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S in position 1, 2, or 5.
- No other letters already ruled out.

A practical pattern that satisfies these constraints is S _ _ R _ or _ S _ R _ or _ _ _ R S, etc.

Let’s try S as position 1 and R as position 4.  
That gives S _ _ R _.

We need two more consonants and the vowel I.  
Let’s choose common consonants L and D.

Candidate: S L I D R → but that’s 6 letters.  
Need 5 letters: S _ _ R _ → S _ I R _.  
Choose a consonant for position 2.  
Let’s try C: S C I R _ → but we need 5 letters total, so position 5 must be another consonant.  
Try S C I R P → SCIRP is not a valid English word.

Try S H I R K → SHIRK is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1 (allowed: positions 1,2,5)
- R in position 4 (allowed: positions 3,4,5)

   Therefore R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
4. S must appear somewhere other than position 4 (from AROSE) and somewhere other than position 3 (from RUSTY).  
   Therefore S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
5. Vowels left to try: I (only common vowel not yet ruled out).

Consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with:
- Exactly one R and one S (because only those two letters have been confirmed so far).
- At least one vowel (I is the only vowel left that hasn’t been eliminated).
- R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S in position 1, 2, or 5.
- No other letters already ruled out.

A practical pattern that satisfies these constraints is S _ _ R _ or _ S _ R _ or _ _ _ R S, etc.

Let’s try S as position 1 and R as position 4.  
That gives S _ _ R _.

We need two more consonants and the vowel I.  
Let’s choose common consonants L and D.

Candidate: S L I D R → but that’s 6 letters.  
Need 5 letters: S _ _ R _ → S _ I R _.  
Choose a consonant for position 2.  
Let’s try C: S C I R _ → but we need 5 letters total, so position 5 must be another consonant.  
Try S C I R P → SCIRP is not a valid English word.

Try S H I R K → SHIRK is a valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1 (allowed: positions 1,2,5)
- R in position 4 (allowed: positions 3,4,5)
- Contains I (only remaining vowel)
- No forbidden letters (A, E, O, U, T, Y, etc.)

Therefore SHIRK satisfies everything.

The latest feedback tells us almost everything we need:

SHIRK -> S(✓) H(x) I(✓) R(✓) K(✓)

- S is in the correct first position.
- I is in the correct third position.
- R is in the correct fourth position.
- K is in the correct fifth position.
- H is NOT in the word.

So the secret pattern is:  
S _ I R K

We must fill the second letter with any consonant except those already ruled out (A, E, O, U, T, Y, H).  
Remaining common consonants include B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words matching S _ I R K:

- SCIRK – not valid  
- SKIRK – slang form of ‘skulk’, but rare  
- SPIRK – not valid  
- SBIRK – not valid  
- STIRK – a young bull/ox, valid word

STIRK uses S T I R K, and T has not been ruled out for position 2 (only positions 3 and 4 were tested before).  
Therefore, STIRK fits perfectly.

Since position 2 (the blank) has only one letter left to determine and T is allowed, STIRK is almost certainly the secret word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting word strategies include:
- Words with multiple vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L

A good balance is ""AROSE"":
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are very common in 5-letter words
- Covers different parts of the alphabet

This should give me good information about which vowels are in the word and whether S or R are present.

- A(x): A is **not** in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but **wrong position** (position 2 in the guess).
- O(x): O is **not** in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but **wrong position** (position 4 in the guess).
- E(x): E is **not** in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains **R and S**.
2. R is **not** in position 2, and S is **not** in position 4.
3. The word does **not** contain A, O, or E.

Vowels left to try: I, U, Y (though Y is sometimes a vowel).

Consonants we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need to place R and S in new positions and try one or two new vowels. Let's try:

- Place R in position 1 (since it can't be in position 2).
- Place S in position 2 (since it can't be in position 4).
- Try I and U as vowels.
- Add a common consonant like T.

A good next guess: **RUSTY**

Check:
- R in position 1 (new position)
- U (new vowel)
- S in position 2 (new position)
- T (new consonant)
- Y (new vowel/consonant)

This covers new letters and repositions R and S.

We now know the exact pattern:  
S _ I R K  
and the second letter is NOT T, H, A, O, E, U, Y, etc.

Common consonants still allowed in position 2: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z.

Looking up real 5-letter English words that fit S ? I R K:

- SCIRK – not a valid word  
- SDIRK – not valid  
- SFIRK – not valid  
- SGIRK – not valid  
- SLIRK – not valid  
- SMIRK – YES, this is a real word (“smirk”).

No other regular English word with that pattern is common.  
SMIRK uses the allowed letter M in position 2 and has never been tried.  
It’s the only plausible remaining candidate.

(For completeness: “spirk” and “swirk” are obsolete/rare, so SMIRK is the clear choice.)
