For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. This means I should use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some good first guesses include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, or ADIEU. These all use common letters and vowels that are likely to appear in many words.

I'll go with CRANE as my first guess. It has:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help me eliminate or confirm several letters right away.

The feedback tells me:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter)
- C is in the word but in the wrong position
- N is in the word but in the wrong position
- R and A are NOT in the word at all

So the secret word ends in E, contains C and N (but not in positions 1 or 4 respectively), and does not contain R or A.

I need a new word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Has C somewhere (but not at the start)
3. Has N somewhere (but not at the 4th spot)

Possible candidates: CHINE, CLONE, CHONE, CN*E won't work since C is 1st. 

Let me think of valid 5-letter words that end in E and have C and N:
- ONCEE? Not valid.
- MINCE: ends in E, has C (not 1st), has N (not 4th) - but N is 2nd here which is allowed since previous N was 4th
- PENCE: same structure as MINCE
- DANCE: A is excluded
- LANCE: A is excluded
- SINCE: ends in E, has C (3rd), has N (2nd) - both positions are new for C and N

SINCE looks good - it satisfies all constraints from the feedback.

Also checking:
- E is correct at 5th
- C is now 3rd (new position)
- N is now 2nd (new position)
- Doesn't use R or A

- I is not in the word
- N is in the correct position (position 3)
- C is in the correct position (position 4)
