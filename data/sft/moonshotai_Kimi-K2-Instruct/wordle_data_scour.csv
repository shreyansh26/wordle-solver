2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters
- Good mix of positions for letters

This should give me information about several common letters and their positions early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(✓) : the first letter is definitely S.
- L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) : none of L, A, T, E appear in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. The remaining letters do NOT include L, A, T, E.

Now I need a five-letter word starting with S that avoids the forbidden letters L, A, T, E. Good consonants still available include R, N, C, D, G, M, P, V, etc. Good vowels still available include I, O, U.

I’ll try to probe common letters while respecting the constraints. A sensible second guess could be “SOUND”:
- It starts with S.
- It avoids L, A, T, E.
- It introduces the vowels O, U and the consonants N, D.

So far we have:

- S(✓) is locked as the first letter.
- O(-) and U(-) are somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- L, A, T, E, N, D are completely absent.

That leaves the possible consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z and the remaining vowels I, O, U (O and U must appear).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing both O and U, but not in positions 2 and 3. The remaining consonants must be chosen from the allowed set.

Possible patterns considering positions:
- S _ _ _ _ 
- O must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- U must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s consider possible placements:
- O can’t be in position 2 or 3 (since it was wrong in position 2 in SOUND), so O must be in 4 or 5.
- U can’t be in position 3, so U must be in 2, 4, or 5, but cannot overlap with O’s positions.

Let’s try:
- S U _ _ O (U in 2, O in 5)
- S _ U O _ (U in 3, but this is invalid since U was wrong in position 3 in SOUND)
- S _ _ O U (O in 4, U in 5)

The most promising seems SU__O or S__OU. Let’s think of words that fit:

- SU__O: Looking for words like ""SUSHO"" (invalid), ""SULFO"" (invalid), ""SUSCO"" (invalid)… doesn’t seem common.
- S__OU: ""SHOUT"" comes to mind - S H O U T. Let’s check:
  - S ✓ (correct position)
  - H (new, allowed)
  - O (needs to be in position 3, but in SOUND O was in position 2 and marked wrong position, so O can be in 3, 4, or 5 - this is fine)
  - U (needs to be in position 4, in SOUND U was in position 3 and marked wrong position, so U can be in 2, 4, or 5 - this is fine)
  - T (but T was ruled out by SLATE feedback)

Oops, ""SHOUT"" contains T, which is forbidden. Next option: ""SCOUR"":
- S C O U R
- C, R are allowed (not in forbidden list)
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since it was wrong position in SOUND)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was wrong position in SOUND)
- R is allowed

This seems valid. Let’s confirm:
- S ✓
- C: new letter, allowed
- O: must be in word somewhere (confirmed), not in position 2 (OK, here it’s 3)
- U: must be in word somewhere (confirmed), not in position 3 (OK, here it’s 4)
- R: new letter, allowed

No forbidden letters are present. This seems like a good next guess.
