For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters, ideally with minimal letter repetition. Some good candidates are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with **SLATE** as it includes S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters, giving us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1
- L is in the word AND in position 2
- A is in the word AND in position 3
- T is NOT in the word at all
- E is NOT in the word at all

So we know the pattern is: _ L A _ _ with S somewhere after position 1 and no T or E anywhere.

Letters we can eliminate: T, E  
Confirmed letters: L(2), A(3)  
S appears somewhere in positions 2–5 (but position 2 is L, so 3–5).

Good next candidates should include:
- S in one of positions 4 or 5
- Common consonants/vowels we haven’t tried (R, N, M, C, H, I, O, U, etc.)

Possible words:
- CLASP → C, L, A, S, P → but S is in position 4, which is allowed
- PLANS → P, L, A, N, S → S in position 5
- SLANG → S is in position 1 (disallowed)
- FLASK → F, L, A, S, K → S in position 4

I’ll choose **CLASP** because:
- It keeps L(2) and A(3) correct
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- Uses new letters C and P to test more possibilities
