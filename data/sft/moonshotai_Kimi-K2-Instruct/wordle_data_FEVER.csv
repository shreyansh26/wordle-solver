For the first guess, we want a word that will provide the maximum amount of information. This means choosing a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- ADIEU (uses many vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (common letters)
- STARE (another good option)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E) which should help eliminate many possibilities regardless of the feedback.

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates C, A, N  
   - R is somewhere other than position 2  
   - E is somewhere other than position 5  

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(x)
   - Eliminates T, I, S  
   - E is in the correct position: position 4  
   - R is somewhere other than position 2  

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, I, S  
Letters we know ARE in the word: E at position 4, R (somewhere except 2)  
Missing letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

R cannot be in positions 2, and now also cannot be in position 3 (from TRIES feedback), so possible positions for R: 1, 5.

We have the pattern: _ _ _ E _ with R in 1 or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has R in a new position (position 1)  
- Introduces new common consonants  
- Uses valid remaining letters  

A good candidate is ""ROGER"". Wait, R in position 1, E in position 4, but O and G are new letters and valid.

But ""ROGER"" is 5 letters: R O G E R. This would have R in 1 and 5, but same letter twice may not be ideal. Also, R can’t be in position 5 because then position 1 would need another letter.

Alternative: ""RUGER"" – but same double R issue.

Better: ""RIDER""  
- R at 1 (valid)  
- I is already eliminated (from TRIES) – oops, can’t use I.

Next: ""RIVER"" – again has I (invalid).

""RUDER"" – R at 1 and 5, but double R is allowed in English, and U, D are new letters.

But simpler: ""RUBER"" – R at 1 and 5, U and B new.

""ROVER"" – O and V new, but R at 1 and 5.

""ROGER"" is actually best here as it introduces O, G and has R at 1 and 5. If R is at 1, then position 5 is another letter. If R is at 5, then position 1 is R – both possible.

But ""ROGER"" has R at 1 and 5 – feedback would tell us if R is at 1 or 5 or both.

Missing letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

R cannot be in positions 2, and now also cannot be in position 3 (from TRIES feedback), so possible positions for R: 1, 5.

We have the pattern: _ _ _ E _ with R in 1 or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has R in a new position (position 1)  
- Introduces new common consonants  
- Uses valid remaining letters  

A good candidate is ""ROGER"". Wait, R in position 1, E in position 4, but O and G are new letters and valid.

But ""ROGER"" is 5 letters: R O G E R. This would have R in 1 and 5, but same letter twice may not be ideal. Also, R can’t be in position 5 because then position 1 would need another letter.

Alternative: ""RUGER"" – but same double R issue.

Better: ""RIDER""  
- R at 1 (valid)  
- I is already eliminated (from TRIES) – oops, can’t use I.

Next: ""RIVER"" – again has I (invalid).

""RUDER"" – R at 1 and 5, but double R is allowed in English, and U, D are new letters.

But simpler: ""RUBER"" – R at 1 and 5, U and B new.

""ROVER"" – O and V new, but R at 1 and 5.

""ROGER"" is actually best here as it introduces O, G and has R at 1 and 5. If R is at 1, then position 5 is another letter. If R is at 5, then position 1 is R – both possible.

But ""ROGER"" has R at 1 and 5 – feedback would tell us if R is at 1 or 5 or both.

However, let’s try ""ROGER"":

Pattern: R _ _ E _ with new letters O and G.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Letters known NOT in the word (x)
C, A, N, T, I, S, O, G

Letters known to be IN the word and their positions
E is in position 4
R is in position 5 (the final R in ROGER got ✓)

Letter R’s possible positions
From CRANE: R ≠ 2
From TRIES: R ≠ 3
From ROGER: R = 5 (✓ on the last R) → so R is locked at position 5

So the hidden word has the form:
_ _ _ E R

Remaining unused common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that ends in _ _ _ E R and uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s pick one that uses three new consonants in the first three positions.  
A simple, frequent ending is “UNDER”.

- U, N, D are all still possible?  
   – N was marked x in CRANE, so “UNDER” is invalid (contains N).

Next: “FLEER” – but “FLEER” is uncommon.

Next: “FEVER”  
- F, V new; E already placed; R locked at 5.  
- Checks: F, E, V, E, R – no forbidden letters.

Another quick sanity-check: no C, A, N, T, I, S, O, G appear, so “FEVER” fits every rule.
