Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to maximize information gain)

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good starting word should incorporate several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the two guesses we now know:

Confirmed facts
- R is fixed in position 2: _ R _ _ _
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it got “-”, so it must be in 1 or 3)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (same reasoning: it must be in 1 or 3)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, T, I

Therefore the secret word must look like one of these two skeletons:
1. S R E _ _   (S in 1, E in 3)
2. E R S _ _   (E in 1, S in 3)

We still need two more consonants (positions 4 and 5), drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, T, I).  
We want a single guess that could fit either skeleton and gives us maximum information.

A good test word that satisfies both possibilities is “PRESS”:
- PRESS fits skeleton 2 (E in 1, S in 3: E R S _ _ is impossible, but PRESS is still legal because it puts S in 4, which we already know is forbidden for the real S — so we expect S to be marked “x” in position 4, which would immediately tell us skeleton 1 is correct).
- It also introduces two new letters (P and another S), helping us learn quickly.

However, a cleaner choice is to pick a word that definitely contains the required letters in one of the two valid arrangements.  The simplest neutral probe that satisfies the constraints and introduces new letters is “CREWS” (but W is already a new letter).

Actually, let’s be systematic:  
If S must be in 1 or 3 and E must be in 1 or 3, and they must be in different positions, the only two concrete patterns are:
- S R E _ _
- E R S _ _

Choosing a word that matches the first pattern is safe and gives us info about positions 4 and 5.  A valid candidate is “SREND” – but that’s not a real word.  The real word fitting S R E _ _ is “SREWD” (invalid).  So let’s pick a real word that uses the S-in-1 possibility: “SREWD” is invalid.  A valid word that starts with S and has E in position 3 is “SCREW” – but that would put W in 5 and C in 4.  Let’s check:

SCREW:
positions: 1=S, 2=R, 3=E, 4=C, 5=W  
- S in 1 ✓  
- R in 2 ✓  
- E in 3 ✓  
- introduces C and W.

This seems optimal: it directly tests the S-in-1, E-in-3 arrangement and adds two new letters.

So I will guess:

We want a single guess that could fit either skeleton and gives us maximum information.

A good test word that satisfies both possibilities is “PRESS”:
- PRESS fits skeleton 2 (E in 1, S in 3: E R S _ _ is impossible, but PRESS is still legal because it puts S in 4, which we already know is forbidden for the real S — so we expect S to be marked “x” in position 4, which would immediately tell us skeleton 1 is correct).
- It also introduces two new letters (P and another S), helping us learn quickly.

However, a cleaner choice is to pick a word that definitely contains the required letters in one of the two valid arrangements.  The simplest neutral probe that satisfies the constraints and introduces new letters is “CREWS” (but W is already a new letter).

Actually, let’s be systematic:  
If S must be in 1 or 3 and E must be in 1 or 3, and they must be in different positions, the only two concrete patterns are:
- S R E _ _
- E R S _ _

Choosing a word that matches the first pattern is safe and gives us info about positions 4 and 5.  A valid candidate is “SREND” – but that’s not a real word.  The real word fitting S R E _ _ is “SREWD” (invalid).  So let’s pick a real word that uses the S-in-1 possibility: “SREWD” is invalid.  A valid word that starts with S and has E in position 3 is “SCREW” – but that would put W in 5 and C in 4.  Let’s check:

SCREW:
positions: 1=S, 2=R, 3=E, 4=C, 5=W  
- S in 1 ✓  
- R in 2 ✓  
- E in 3 ✓  
- introduces C and W.

This seems optimal: it directly tests the S-in-1, E-in-3 arrangement and adds two new letters.

So I will guess:

Let me extract what we now know:

Letters fixed:
- R is in position 2 (✓ at every guess).

Letters that must be in the word, positions still unknown:
- S (always “-” so far, never in position 1, 4 or 5) → S can only be in 3.
- E (always “-” so far, never in position 3, 4 or 5) → E can only be in 1.

Letters ruled out so far: A, O, T, I, C, W.

Current template:
E R S _ _

We still need two consonants for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding the ruled-out ones and avoiding duplicates).

Remaining available consonants (roughly in order of frequency): N, L, D, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits E R S _ _.  The common ones include:
- ERSED (obsolete, unlikely)
- ERSES (plural of ERSE, but double S is wasteful)
- ERSHY (rare)
- ERSES again.

Actually, a more common word that fits is “ERSED” but that’s not an everyday word.  A more likely candidate is “ERSES” but we’d rather avoid repeating S.

Let’s pick a word that uses two new letters from the pool above.  A very common word that matches E R S _ _ is “ERSED” but that’s archaic.  Instead, “ERSNY” is not a word, so let’s use “ERSAN” – but A is already excluded.

A modern valid word that fills E R S _ _ and introduces good new letters is “ERSNY” – invalid.

Real valid word: “ERSED” is the only common Scrabble-accepted word.  However, double-checking standard vocabulary, “ERSED” is indeed rare.

Let’s step back: we need any legal 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints, not necessarily one starting E-R-S.  We can use a guess that keeps R in position 2, puts S in 3 and E in 1, and tests two new consonants in 4 and 5.  A safe, high-information choice is “ERSKL” – but that’s not a word.

A valid, common word that matches E R S _ _ is “ERSED”.  However, that’s obscure.  Another valid word is “ERSES” (plural of Erse/Scottish Gaelic), but the duplicate S is inefficient.

Let’s simply use “ERSED” as it is acceptable in Scrabble lists and satisfies the constraints, introducing D as a new letter.

But actually, a better strategy is to pick a valid word that simply satisfies the template E R S _ _ and brings in new consonants.  The best, most familiar word that fits is “ERSED”.

Therefore, the logical guess is:

ERS?D  (where ? is a letter).  Actually, let’s be concrete: “ERSAN” – but A is excluded.

Wait, let’s just list valid words: “ERSNY” is invalid.  The only valid English word that fits E R S _ _ with available letters is “ERSED”.

So we will guess ERSED.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good starting word should incorporate several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From all four rounds of feedback:

1. R is locked in position 2 (✓ every time).
2. S is in the word but never in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → the only spot left is position 3, yet every time it has been placed there it still got “-”.  
   This contradiction means my earlier assumption was wrong: S cannot be put anywhere without getting “-”, so S must actually NOT be in the word at all.  
   BUT the first two guesses both gave S the “is-in-word-but-wrong-position” mark (-), which says S IS present.  
   The only way both facts hold is that every time S has been tried it landed in a forbidden spot, so the true position for S is the one never yet probed for it: positions 4 or 5.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,fresh,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to maximize information gain)

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good starting word should incorporate several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)
- A and O are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _
Known letters to include: R, S, E
Known positions to avoid: S≠4, E≠5
Letters to exclude: A, O

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Includes S somewhere (but not position 4)
3. Includes E somewhere (but not position 5)
4. Avoids A and O
5. Uses new letters to maximize information

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (but Y is sometimes consonant)

""TRIES"" fits:
- T R I E S: R in position 2 (correct)
- Uses E in position 4 (allowed, since E≠5 is satisfied)
- Uses S in position 5 (allowed, since S≠4 is satisfied)
- Introduces T and I which are new letters
- Avoids A and O

Alternative check: ""CREST"" would have S in 4 (forbidden), ""DREST"" same issue, ""FRIES"" would have E in 4, S in 5 like TRIES but F is less common than T. ""TRIES"" seems optimal.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

Confirmed facts
- R is fixed in position 2: _ R _ _ _
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it got “-”, so it must be in 1 or 3)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (same reasoning: it must be in 1 or 3)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, T, I

Therefore the secret word must look like one of these two skeletons:
1. S R E _ _   (S in 1, E in 3)
2. E R S _ _   (E in 1, S in 3)

We still need two more consonants (positions 4 and 5), drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, T, I).  
We want a single guess that could fit either skeleton and gives us maximum information.

A good test word that satisfies both possibilities is “PRESS”:
- PRESS fits skeleton 2 (E in 1, S in 3: E R S _ _ is impossible, but PRESS is still legal because it puts S in 4, which we already know is forbidden for the real S — so we expect S to be marked “x” in position 4, which would immediately tell us skeleton 1 is correct).
- It also introduces two new letters (P and another S), helping us learn quickly.

However, a cleaner choice is to pick a word that definitely contains the required letters in one of the two valid arrangements.  The simplest neutral probe that satisfies the constraints and introduces new letters is “CREWS” (but W is already a new letter).

Actually, let’s be systematic:  
If S must be in 1 or 3 and E must be in 1 or 3, and they must be in different positions, the only two concrete patterns are:
- S R E _ _
- E R S _ _

Choosing a word that matches the first pattern is safe and gives us info about positions 4 and 5.  A valid candidate is “SREND” – but that’s not a real word.  The real word fitting S R E _ _ is “SREWD” (invalid).  So let’s pick a real word that uses the S-in-1 possibility: “SREWD” is invalid.  A valid word that starts with S and has E in position 3 is “SCREW” – but that would put W in 5 and C in 4.  Let’s check:

SCREW:
positions: 1=S, 2=R, 3=E, 4=C, 5=W  
- S in 1 ✓  
- R in 2 ✓  
- E in 3 ✓  
- introduces C and W.

This seems optimal: it directly tests the S-in-1, E-in-3 arrangement and adds two new letters.

So I will guess:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me extract what we now know:

Letters fixed:
- R is in position 2 (✓ at every guess).

Letters that must be in the word, positions still unknown:
- S (always “-” so far, never in position 1, 4 or 5) → S can only be in 3.
- E (always “-” so far, never in position 3, 4 or 5) → E can only be in 1.

Letters ruled out so far: A, O, T, I, C, W.

Current template:
E R S _ _

We still need two consonants for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining unused letters (excluding the ruled-out ones and avoiding duplicates).

Remaining available consonants (roughly in order of frequency): N, L, D, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits E R S _ _.  The common ones include:
- ERSED (obsolete, unlikely)
- ERSES (plural of ERSE, but double S is wasteful)
- ERSHY (rare)
- ERSES again.

Actually, a more common word that fits is “ERSED” but that’s not an everyday word.  A more likely candidate is “ERSES” but we’d rather avoid repeating S.

Let’s pick a word that uses two new letters from the pool above.  A very common word that matches E R S _ _ is “ERSED” but that’s archaic.  Instead, “ERSNY” is not a word, so let’s use “ERSAN” – but A is already excluded.

A modern valid word that fills E R S _ _ and introduces good new letters is “ERSNY” – invalid.

Real valid word: “ERSED” is the only common Scrabble-accepted word.  However, double-checking standard vocabulary, “ERSED” is indeed rare.

Let’s step back: we need any legal 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints, not necessarily one starting E-R-S.  We can use a guess that keeps R in position 2, puts S in 3 and E in 1, and tests two new consonants in 4 and 5.  A safe, high-information choice is “ERSKL” – but that’s not a word.

A valid, common word that matches E R S _ _ is “ERSED”.  However, that’s obscure.  Another valid word is “ERSES” (plural of Erse/Scottish Gaelic), but the duplicate S is inefficient.

Let’s simply use “ERSED” as it is acceptable in Scrabble lists and satisfies the constraints, introducing D as a new letter.

But actually, a better strategy is to pick a valid word that simply satisfies the template E R S _ _ and brings in new consonants.  The best, most familiar word that fits is “ERSED”.

Therefore, the logical guess is:

ERS?D  (where ? is a letter).  Actually, let’s be concrete: “ERSAN” – but A is excluded.

Wait, let’s just list valid words: “ERSNY” is invalid.  The only valid English word that fits E R S _ _ with available letters is “ERSED”.

So we will guess ERSED.We now know the word must be:

- Position 2 = R  
- Position 1 = E  
- Position 3 = S  

Letters still needed for positions 4 and 5, drawn from unused consonants (excluding A, O, T, I, C, W).

However, double-checking standard vocabulary, “ERSED” is indeed rare.\n\nLet’s step back: we need any legal 5-letter word that satisfies the constraints, not necessarily one starting E-R-S.

Reconciling all feedback:

1. R is fixed in position 2 (✓ every time).
2. S has always been marked “-” (present but wrong position).  
   It has now appeared in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and still got “-”; therefore S must be in position 2, but that spot is already taken by R.  
   The only logical conclusion is the mark for S was mis-read: it must actually have been an “x” (not in the word) in one of the earlier lines, otherwise we have a contradiction.  
   Looking back carefully: every S received “-” except in Guess 5 it received “-” again. This is impossible unless we realize we missed that S was actually marked “x” in one round.  
   Re-reading the sequence:

   – Guess 1: S(✓) … impossible because only one letter can be ✓.  
   – Ah! I mis-transcribed earlier. Let me lay it out plainly:

   Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)   ← this means:
        position 4 has S ✓   → S is in position 4.

   Guess 2: TRIES → T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(-)  
        S is not in position 5 (consistent with S being in 4).

   Guess 3: SCREW → S(-) C(x) R(-) E(-) W(x)  
        S is not in position 1 (again consistent).

   Guess 4: ERSED → E(-) R(✓) S(-) E(-) D(x)

   Guess 5: ERNES → E(-) R(✓) N(x) E(-) S(-)  
        S is not in position 5 (again consistent).

   So the only fixed letter positions so far are:
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - S is in position 4 (✓)

   The remaining positions 1, 3, 5 are unknown.

   Letters we know:
   - Must include E (always “-” but never in positions 1,3,5 tested so far)  
     Actually E has been placed in positions 1,3,4,5 and always marked “-”, so the only remaining spot is position 1.  
     BUT in Guess 1 E was marked “-” when placed in position 5. This again suggests E must be in position 1,3,4,5 are all forbidden.  That is impossible.  
     Therefore my previous interpretation must be wrong.

   Let’s re-parse the original feedback accurately:

   Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
        R ✓ at 2, S ✓ at 5, E present but not in 5 (-).

   Guess 2: TRIES → T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(-)  
        R ✓ at 2, E present but not in 4 (-), S present but not in 5 (-).

   Guess 3: SCREW → S(-) C(x) R(-) E(-) W(x)  
        R at 2 is ✓ but now it’s marked “-”?  That is inconsistent.  
        Wait the actual feedback for SCREW was: S(-) C(x) R(-) E(-) W(x)  
        That means: R in position 3 is “-” (wrong position) – but we know R must be in position 2.  This shows that the feedback given in the prompt is inconsistent with R being fixed at position 2.

   The only way to resolve this is to realize that the mark “-” does NOT indicate “present but wrong position”, it indicates “present but in the wrong position for THIS guess only”.  So:

   Let me re-interpret the four marks according to standard Wordle rules:

   ✓ : right letter, right spot  
   - : right letter, wrong spot  
   x : letter not in word

   Then:

   Guess 1: AROSE  
   A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
        positions: 1A x, 2R ✓, 3O x, 4S ✓, 5E -  
        → R at 2 is correct, S at 4 is correct, E is in word but not at 5.

   So word shape: _ R _ S _ and E is somewhere in 1 or 3.

   T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(-)  
        T x, R ✓, I x, E -, S -  
        → confirms R at 2 ✓, E present but not at 4, S present but not at 5.  
        But we already have S at 4 from Guess 1, so S at 5 must be “-” because S is already taken at 4.  This is consistent.

   Guess 3: SCREW  
   S(-) C(x) R(-) E(-) W(x)  
        S at 1 is wrong spot (expected, S is at 4), R at 3 is wrong spot, E at 4 is wrong spot (expected, E is not yet placed), C and W eliminated.

   Guess 4: ERSED  
   E(-) R(✓) S(-) E(-) D(x)  
        E at 1 is wrong spot, R at 2 ✓, S at 3 is wrong spot (expected), E at 4 is wrong spot, D eliminated.

   Guess 5: ERNES  
   E(-) R(✓) N(x) E(-) S(-)  
        E at 1 is wrong spot, R at 2 ✓, N eliminated, E at 4 is wrong spot, S at 5 is wrong spot (expected).

   Putting this all together:

   Known fixed letters:
   - position 2 = R
   - position 4 = S

   Known that E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from guesses 1,4,5).  
   Therefore E must be in position 3.

   So the skeleton is: _ R E S _

   Letters already used/eliminated: A, O, T, I, C, W, D, N (from guesses 3-5).

   Remaining consonants for positions 1 and 5: from unused letters, common ones are B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, Y.
