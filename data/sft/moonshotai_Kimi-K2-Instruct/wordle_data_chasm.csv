For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU because they cover many common letters. 

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:
1. It has S, L, A, T, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants.
2. The letters S, T, E are among the most frequent letters in English.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong place.  
- A is in the correct position (3rd).  
- L, T, E are not in the word at all.  

So I know:
1. The word has an A in the 3rd position.  
2. It has an S somewhere, but NOT in position 1.  
3. It does not contain L, T, or E.  

I need a new word that:
- Keeps A in spot 3.  
- Includes S somewhere in positions 2-5.  
- Uses none of the discarded letters (L, T, E).  

Good remaining consonants for the other three slots are common ones like R, N, D, P, C, B, G, M, H, V, etc.

Let me try a word that satisfies these rules: “SANDY”
- A is in place 3 (good).  
- S is in place 1 – but feedback said S is in word but wrong place, so S cannot be in 1. SANDY violates that.  

Try another: “RAISE” – but E is banned.  

Try “SUGAR” – but that has 6 letters.  

Try “SANDY” was invalid. Try “SARDI” – but that’s not a common word.  

Try “RASPY” – but Y isn’t ideal.  

Try “SAMBO” – but O is okay, B is okay. Let me pick a more common word.  

Try “SARAN” – but N is okay.  

Let me pick “SARAN” – common, has A in 3, S in 1 (invalid).  

Try “BRASH” – no A in 3.  

Try “CRASH” – no A in 3.  

Try “FRANK” – A in 3, S missing.  

I need a word with A in 3 and S in 2-5.  

Try “GRASP” – A in 3, S in 4. Valid word, no banned letters.  

Good candidate.

From the new feedback on GRASP:
- G, R, P are NOT in the word.
- A remains correct in position 3.
- S is in the word and now correctly placed in position 4.

So the current constraints are:
1. Pattern: _ _ A S _
2. Letters still allowed: all except L, T, E, G, R, P.
3. We still know from Guess 1 that S is somewhere in the word (now placed), and S was only known to be in the word from the first guess. We also know L, T, E are banned, and now G, R, P are banned.

So the word must fit: _ _ A S _ with remaining letters from the allowed set: A, B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but A and S are already placed).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words fitting _ _ A S _:
- CHASM: C, H, A, S, M – no banned letters.
- VASAL: but second A wouldn’t fit (we don’t know about double letters yet).
- BASES: but E is banned.
- FASCI: but C, I are allowed, but not common.
- HASTE: but T, E are banned.
- MASON: but O, N are allowed, and S is already in 4, but N is allowed.
- NASTY: but T is banned.
- WASHY: but Y is allowed, H, W are allowed.

From these, ""CHASM"" looks strong:
- C, H, A, S, M: none of these are banned.
- Fits _ _ A S _.

Another option is ""MASON"", but let’s check:
- M, A, S, O, N: no banned letters. Also fits _ _ A S _ with S in position 4.

Between CHASM and MASON, both are valid, but CHASM has more unique consonants to test.
