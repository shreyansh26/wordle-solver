For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with multiple vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, I think ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
1. R - a very common consonant in 5-letter words
2. A - the most common vowel in English
3. I - another common vowel
4. S - a very common consonant
5. E - the most common letter in English

This combination should give good information about what letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Let me summarize what we now know.

Letters ruled out  
R, A, I, E, O, D, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
S – must be in position 1 (from SOUND and SUNNY)  
N – must be in position 4 (from SUNNY’s fourth-letter ✓)

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed  
U – “in word, wrong position” (from SUNNY: it was at 2, so U must appear elsewhere)  
N – we already pinned the other N at position 4, so the remaining N (position 3 in SUNNY) must move.

So the pattern so far looks like:

S _ _ N _

and we still have to place the letter U somewhere in the remaining slots 2, 3, or 5.

Available letters (no repeats of already-eliminated ones):  
B C F G H J K L M P Q T V W X Z  
plus U (which we still need to place)

Let’s try to make a valid 5-letter word that fits:

S U _ N _ → needs a consonant at position 3  
S _ U N _ → needs a consonant at position 2  
S _ _ N U → needs consonants at positions 2 and 3

A common word that fits S _ _ N U is “STUNG”:

- S at 1 ✓  
- T at 2 – still allowed  
- U at 3 – satisfies “in word but wrong position” from earlier feedback  
- N at 4 ✓  
- G at 5 – still allowed

No eliminated letters appear, and every constraint is respected.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with multiple vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, I think ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
1. R - a very common consonant in 5-letter words
2. A - the most common vowel in English
3. I - another common vowel
4. S - a very common consonant
5. E - the most common letter in English

This combination should give good information about what letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, I, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (but not at position 4).
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, or E.

Good remaining common consonants and vowels: T, O, U, N, L, Y, D, H, etc.
Let’s try “SOUND”. It has S in position 1, O, U, N, D — none of the excluded letters (R, A, I, E). We’ll see how S, O, U, N, D fare.

So the pattern so far is:

S _ _ _ _ with U and N still to place (and no letters R, A, I, E, O, D).

Remaining common letters that are still “live”: T, L, C, Y, K, G, H, M, P, etc.

We need a word of the form S _ _ _ _ that uses U and N in positions 2, 3 or 5, and only letters that have not been ruled out.

Possible candidate: S _ U N _  or S _ N U _  or S U _ N _ etc.

A good possibility is “SUNNY”:

- S ✓ (position 1)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed; only position 3 was ruled out for U)  
- N is in position 3 (allowed; position 4 was ruled out for N)  
- Y is still a live letter.  
- Neither O nor D appear.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me summarize what we now know.

Letters ruled out  
R, A, I, E, O, D, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
S – must be in position 1 (from SOUND and SUNNY)  
N – must be in position 4 (from SUNNY’s fourth-letter ✓)

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed  
U – “in word, wrong position” (from SUNNY: it was at 2, so U must appear elsewhere)  
N – we already pinned the other N at position 4, so the remaining N (position 3 in SUNNY) must move.

So the pattern so far looks like:

S _ _ N _

and we still have to place the letter U somewhere in the remaining slots 2, 3, or 5.

Available letters (no repeats of already-eliminated ones):  
B C F G H J K L M P Q T V W X Z  
plus U (which we still need to place)

Let’s try to make a valid 5-letter word that fits:

S U _ N _ → needs a consonant at position 3  
S _ U N _ → needs a consonant at position 2  
S _ _ N U → needs consonants at positions 2 and 3

A common word that fits S _ _ N U is “STUNG”:

- S at 1 ✓  
- T at 2 – still allowed  
- U at 3 – satisfies “in word but wrong position” from earlier feedback  
- N at 4 ✓  
- G at 5 – still allowed

No eliminated letters appear, and every constraint is respected.

1. **Position locks**  
   S _ _ _ _ → S is locked at position 1.  
   _ T _ _ _ → T is locked at position 2.  
   _ _ U _ _ → U is locked at position 3.  
   _ _ _ N _ → N is locked at position 4.  

2. **Pattern so far**  
   S T U N _

3. **Letters ruled out entirely**  
   R, A, I, E, O, D, Y, G

4. **Therefore the last position (5) must be any letter that**  
   - has not been ruled out,  
   - is not S, T, U, N (no repeats).

Remaining allowed letters include: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form STUN_.

Immediately the word “STUNK” comes to mind (past participle of “stink”).

Check:  
- S, T, U, N are already locked in positions 1–4.  
- K is not among the ruled-out letters.  
- STUNK is a valid English word.

Hence, the only remaining candidate that fits every constraint is STUNK.

3. Position 3: U
4. Position 4: N

So the word must be of the form S T U N _

Letters already ruled out (x): R, A, I, E, O, D, Y, G, K.

Remaining letters not yet tried for position 5: B, C, F, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a real 5-letter English word starting with STUN... The only common ones are:
- STUNT
- STUNK (already ruled out)
- STUNS (but S is already in position 1, and we haven't ruled out S at position 5)

Looking at the remaining letters, ""STUNT"" uses the letter T, but T is already in position 2 and T hasn't been ruled out for position 5 (since we haven't tested it there). The letter T hasn't been ruled out entirely, only position 2 has T confirmed.

Therefore, ""STUNT"" is the remaining candidate.

Check:
- S T U N T: matches all confirmed positions and uses T again which is allowed since only position 2 is locked for T, not the entire letter.
