- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, my best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first guess should use several of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses:
- R (very common)
- A (very common)
- I (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and vowel positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.

- Uses other high-frequency letters remaining.

2. POINT → P(x), O(x), I(-), N(x), T(x)

   - Again confirms I is present but NOT in position 3.

So eliminated letters so far: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T  
Confirmed letter: I (must appear somewhere other than position 3).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: U, L, C, D, G, M, Y, F, H, K, W, B, V, etc.

We want:
- A 5-letter word with I in it (and not in position 3).
- No use of any eliminated letters above.
- Choose other common letters to maximize info gain.

Candidate word: “BUILD”
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed, since only position 3 is forbidden).
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D — none have been ruled out yet.

This keeps it simple while testing four new letters B, U, L, D that haven’t been tested before.

New facts after Guess 3 (BUILD → B(-) U(✓) I(-) L(x) D(x)):
- U is in the word and in the exact 2nd position.
- B is in the word but NOT in the 1st position.
- I is still somewhere (but NOT in 3rd or 4th spot, since it was “-” both times).
- L and D are NOT in the word at all.

Letters definitely absent so far: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T, L, D  
Letters still possible (and their constraints):
- U must be at position 2 (✓).
- I must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 4.
- B must appear somewhere other than position 1.

Looking at the remaining common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y plus I and B.

Current template: _ U _ _ _
Positions left for I: 1, 2 (taken by U), 5. So I can only be at position 1 or 5.

Let’s try putting I in position 1 (since that satisfies “I not in 3 or 4”):
Template: I U _ _ _
We still need B somewhere (not position 1), and two more unused letters.  
Remaining unused common letters: H, M, C, K, G, Y, V …

Candidate word: “IUMBH” is invalid (not a real word), so pick real words:
- “IUMBH” – invalid
- “IUMHC” – invalid
- “HUMIC” – invalid
Next real word fitting I U _ _ _: “IUMED” – invalid (D eliminated)
Try “IUMBF” – invalid
Try “IUMBH” – invalid
Try “IUMBJ” – invalid
Try “IUMCK” – invalid
Real dictionary word: “IUMVC” – none
Real word with I at 5: _ U _ _ I
Then B must fit positions 3 or 4 (since pos 1,2,5 taken and B cannot be at 1).
Example valid word: “QUIBI” – Q eliminated (not used yet, but Q is less common and might be risky).  
Let’s choose “CUBIC” – C, B, I, C.  Check letters: C not eliminated, B allowed, I allowed, U is fixed at 2.  However B is at position 3 (allowed), I at 5 (allowed).  C appears twice but that’s okay.  This tests C, B, and puts I at 5.  “CUBIC” is a valid English word.

So I will guess CUBIC.
