For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should contain several of these. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- RAINS (contains R, A, I, N, S)

I'll go with ARISE because it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage across the alphabet.

- From Guess 2 (TONED):

    – O(x): O is NOT in the word.
    – N(x): N is NOT in the word.
    – E(-): E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  (This we already knew: E is in position 5.)
    – D(x): D is NOT in the word.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, I, S, O, N, D  
Confirmed letters/positions:
    – E at position 5.
Confirmed letters with unknown positions:
    – T (cannot be position 1).

We still need to place four other letters and we have positions 1-4 to fill.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, M, P, B, G, H, F, K, Y, W  
Remaining common vowels: U

Good next word should:
- Place E at 5.
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Try to test new common letters while respecting T’s constraint.

Candidate patterns: _ _ _ _ E  
First letter must not be T (because T is not in position 1), but T must appear somewhere else.

Let’s try to include T in position 3 or 4, plus use U and other common letters.

Possible word: U L T E ?  – but E is already slot 5, so positions 1-4 must be U, L, T, plus one more consonant.

Word “CLUTE” – but C is allowed, but we have 5 letters and we need to avoid C? Let’s check.

Wait: we need a real 5-letter word that ends in E, avoids A,R,I,S,O,N,D, and uses T somewhere NOT in position 1.

Let’s think of words ending in E with no A,R,I,S,O,N,D and T somewhere not first.

Examples:
- BUTTE – uses B,U,T,T,E.  T is in position 3 (ok), but two T’s might be inefficient.
- CUTIE – C,U,T,I,E – but I is eliminated.
- FUTILE – 6 letters, too long.
- MULE – too short.

A better word might be “CLUTE” – but is that a valid word?  Not common.

Let’s look for real common 5-letter words:
- U T I L E – but I is eliminated.
- B U T L E – but T is position 3, but BUTLE is not a word.

Actually, “BUTLE” is not recognized.  “CLUTE” not common.

Good candidate: “EMBUE” – but starts with E, but E is position 5.

Another candidate: “FUGUE” – but E is position 5, F,U,G,U,E.  That has two U’s and G, but G is ok, O is out, but U is ok.  However, FUGUE is a real word and uses F,U,G,E – but we still need to test T.

We need a word that includes T somewhere not first.

Real word ending in E with T not first: “CUTE” – too short.

Let’s try “FLUTE”: F,L,U,T,E.  
- F: new letter
- L: new letter
- U: new letter
- T: must not be first, here it is position 4 – allowed (- from TONED means T is in word but not position 1, so T can be in 2,3,4.  Here 4 is ok).
- E: already confirmed position 5.

This seems perfect.

Let’s check eliminated letters: A,R,I,S,O,N,D are avoided.  T is allowed in position 4.

- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (from Guess 1).
- From Guess 2 (TONED):
    – T(-): T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
    – O(x): O is NOT in the word.
    – N(x): N is NOT in the word.
    – E(-): E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  (This we already knew: E is in position 5.)
    – D(x): D is NOT in the word.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, I, S, O, N, D  
Confirmed letters/positions:
    – E at position 5.
Confirmed letters with unknown positions:
    – T (cannot be position 1).

We still need to place four other letters and we have positions 1-4 to fill.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, M, P, B, G, H, F, K, Y, W  
Remaining common vowels: U

Good next word should:
- Place E at 5.
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Try to test new common letters while respecting T’s constraint.

Candidate patterns: _ _ _ _ E  
First letter must not be T (because T is not in position 1), but T must appear somewhere else.

Let’s try to include T in position 3 or 4, plus use U and other common letters.

Possible word: U L T E ?  – but E is already slot 5, so positions 1-4 must be U, L, T, plus one more consonant.

Word “CLUTE” – but C is allowed, but we have 5 letters and we need to avoid C? Let’s check.

Wait: we need a real 5-letter word that ends in E, avoids A,R,I,S,O,N,D, and uses T somewhere NOT in position 1.

Let’s think of words ending in E with no A,R,I,S,O,N,D and T somewhere not first.

Examples:
- BUTTE – uses B,U,T,T,E.  T is in position 3 (ok), but two T’s might be inefficient.
- CUTIE – C,U,T,I,E – but I is eliminated.
- FUTILE – 6 letters, too long.
- MULE – too short.

A better word might be “CLUTE” – but is that a valid word?  Not common.

Let’s look for real common 5-letter words:
- U T I L E – but I is eliminated.
- B U T L E – but T is position 3, but BUTLE is not a word.

Actually, “BUTLE” is not recognized.  “CLUTE” not common.

Good candidate: “EMBUE” – but starts with E, but E is position 5.

Another candidate: “FUGUE” – but E is position 5, F,U,G,U,E.  That has two U’s and G, but G is ok, O is out, but U is ok.  However, FUGUE is a real word and uses F,U,G,E – but we still need to test T.

We need a word that includes T somewhere not first.

Real word ending in E with T not first: “CUTE” – too short.

Let’s try “FLUTE”: F,L,U,T,E.  
- F: new letter
- L: new letter
- U: new letter
- T: must not be first, here it is position 4 – allowed (- from TONED means T is in word but not position 1, so T can be in 2,3,4.  Here 4 is ok).
- E: already confirmed position 5.

This seems perfect.

Let’s check eliminated letters: A,R,I,S,O,N,D are avoided.  T is allowed in position 4.

So I’ll guess FLUTE.

Current known facts:

- Word is 5 letters long, ends with E (position 5 ✓).
- From TONED: T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  From FLUTE: T is now confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- From FLUTE: 
   – F(x) – F is NOT in the word.
   – L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
   – U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – T(✓) – T is in position 4.
   – E(✓) – E is in position 5.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, I, S, O, N, D, F, L.

Confirmed positions:
   – 4th letter = T
   – 5th letter = E

Word pattern: _ _ _ T E

We still need three more distinct letters in positions 1, 2, 3.  
These letters must:
   – be chosen from consonants/​vowels not yet eliminated.
   – U is known to be in the word but NOT in position 3, so U could be in 1 or 2.

Remaining candidate letters (common): B, C, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, plus the vowel U.

Quick brainstorm of valid English words fitting _ _ _ T E and avoiding eliminated letters:

- BUTTE – uses B, U, T, T, E (double T, but T already fixed once; valid word)  
  Would test B and U in positions 1 and 2.  
- CUTE? – needs 4 letters, so not 5.  
- CUTIE – eliminated I.  
- GUTTE – not a real word.  
- HUTTE – not common.  
- KUTTE – German loanword, not ideal.  
- MUTTE – not a word.  
- POUTE – eliminated O.  
- YOUTH – not ending in E.  
- WUTTE – not a word.  

Realistic choice: BUTTE – uses B, U, T, T, E.  
It fits the pattern B U T T E, so positions 1=B, 2=U, 3=T, 4=T, 5=E.  
Even though it repeats T, it still confirms B and ensures U is placed (and since we know U cannot be in position 3, positions 1 or 2 are fine).

Let’s go with BUTTE to test B and U in positions 1 and 2.
