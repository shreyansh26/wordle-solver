For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)

I'm going with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Feedback recap:
- E (✓): E is in the word and is the 5th letter.
- C, R, A, N (x): none of these letters appear anywhere else.

So we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. The first four letters are NOT C, R, A, N.

We need a word that:
- Has length 5.
- Ends with E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonant choices for positions 1-4 that avoid the forbidden letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good vowels: I, O, U (since E is already used and A is ruled out).

Possible candidate: ""SLIDE"" – uses S, L, I, D, E. All letters are allowed (no C, R, A, N), ends in E, and includes two new vowels (I) and some new consonants (S, L, D).

Another candidate: ""MIDGE"" – uses M, I, D, G, E. Also valid.

I'm going with ""SLIDE"" because it spreads the information across more new letters.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. The word ends with **E** (5th position).
2. **I** is in the word and is in the **3rd position** (from SLIDE feedback: I(✓)).
3. **S** is in the word but **not** in the 1st position (S(-) from SLIDE feedback).
4. Letters **C, R, A, N, L, D** are **not** in the word at all (all marked with x).
5. Letters **E, I, S** are confirmed to be in the word, with **E** in 5th and **I** in 3rd positions.

So the word structure is: _ _ I _ E, where:
- The 1st letter must be S (since S is in the word but not in position 1, and we already know S is in the word).
Wait, no: S(-) means S is in the word but *not* in position 1. So S could be in positions 2 or 4.

But we also have positions 1, 2, 4 to fill, avoiding C, R, A, N, L, D.

Possible letters for positions 1, 2, 4 (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also, position 3 is I, position 5 is E.

Possible words:
- We know S must be in position 2 or 4.
- Let's try S in position 2: _ S I _ E. Then position 1 and 4 need to be filled with allowed letters.
- Example: B S I D E – but D is ruled out (from SLIDE feedback).
- M S I T E – but T and M are allowed. Check if MSITE is a word... no, it doesn't seem valid.
- Let's try S in position 4: _ _ I S E. Then positions 1 and 2 need to be filled with allowed letters.
- Example: B U I S E – ""BUISE"" is rare, probably not valid.
- Another example: M O I S E – ""MOISE"" is also rare.
- Another: H O I S E – ""HOISE"" is archaic.
- T O I S E – ""TOISE"" is a unit of measure, but obscure.
- G O I S E – no.
- F U I S E – no.
- P O I S E – ""POISE"" is a valid word!

""POISE"" fits:
- P (allowed, not in forbidden list)
- O (allowed, not forbidden)
- I (in position 3, correct)
- S (in position 4, satisfies S(-) since it's not in position 1)
- E (in position 5, correct)

Also, let's verify no forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, L, D are all absent. Good.

So ""POISE"" seems like a strong candidate.
