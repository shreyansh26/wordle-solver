This is the first guess in a Wordle-like game, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Good starting words typically:
1. Contain common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Have a balanced vowel/consonant mix

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) with no repeats, and covers both common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

Summary after two guesses:

1. C(✓) fixed in position 1.
2. Letters already ruled out: R, N, H, S.
3. Letters confirmed present but whose exact positions are still unknown: A and E (each has appeared with “–”, so they’re somewhere in the other four positions 2-5 but not in the spots we tried).

Current template: C _ _ _ _

Positions tried for A and E so far:
- A appeared in position 2 (CRANE) → A ≠ 2
- A appeared in position 3 (CHASE) → A ≠ 3
- E appeared in position 5 (CRANE) → E ≠ 5
- E appeared in position 5 (CHASE) → confirms E ≠ 5

So A must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Possible placements:
Case 1: A in 4 → E could be 2 or 3
Case 2: A in 5 → E could be 2, 3, or 4

We need a word that:
- Starts with C
- Uses A and E exactly once each in allowed positions
- Introduces new, frequent letters (avoiding R,N,H,S already excluded)

Candidate letters still unused that are common: L, T, I, D, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Looking at the possibilities systematically:

If we try placing E in position 2:
C E _ _ _
A must then go in position 4:
C E _ A _
The blank (position 3) needs a letter not yet used. Good choices among common ones: T, L, I, D, M, etc.
- C E T A _ → need a 5th letter (but we’re only filling 5 total letters)
- C E T A L → CETAL (not a valid English word)
- C E L A T → CELAT (invalid)
- C E D A R → CEDAR (but R is excluded)
- C E L A M → CELAM (invalid)
- C E L A _ → CELAS (invalid), CELAY (invalid)

Try another pattern: A in 5 and E in 3:
C _ E _ A
Blank positions 2 and 4. Need two new letters.
- C O E L A → COELA (invalid)
- C O E T A → COETA (invalid)
- C L E V A → CLEVA (invalid), but V is uncommon
- C L E A T → rule breaker (A in 5, E in 3: CLEAT — valid 5-letter word!)

Check constraints:
- Starts with C ✓
- Uses A and E once each in allowed positions (A in 5, E in 3) ✓
- Introduces new letters yet untested: L and T (both common) ✓
- Avoids R,N,H,S ✓
- Valid English word ✓

Therefore, CLEAT is an excellent third guess.

We need a word that:
- Starts with C
- Uses A and E exactly once each in allowed positions
- Introduces new, frequent letters (avoiding R,N,H,S already excluded)

Candidate letters still unused that are common: L, T, I, D, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Looking at the possibilities systematically:

If we try placing E in position 2:
C E _ _ _
A must then go in position 4:
C E _ A _
The blank (position 3) needs a letter not yet used. Good choices among common ones: T, L, I, D, M, etc.
- C E T A _ → need a 5th letter (but we’re only filling 5 total letters)
- C E T A L → CETAL (not a valid English word)
- C E L A T → CELAT (invalid)
- C E D A R → CEDAR (but R is excluded)
- C E L A M → CELAM (invalid)
- C E L A _ → CELAS (invalid), CELAY (invalid)

Try another pattern: A in 5 and E in 3:
C _ E _ A
Blank positions 2 and 4. Need two new letters.
- C O E L A → COELA (invalid)
- C O E T A → COETA (invalid)
- C L E V A → CLEVA (invalid), but V is uncommon
- C L E A T → rule breaker (A in 5, E in 3: CLEAT — valid 5-letter word!)

Check constraints:
- Starts with C ✓
- Uses A and E once each in allowed positions (A in 5, E in 3) ✓
- Introduces new letters yet untested: L and T (both common) ✓
- Avoids R,N,H,S ✓

Therefore, CLEAT is an excellent third guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- C is fixed in position 1.
- Letters ruled out: R, N, H, S, T.
- Letters confirmed present (but each only once): A, E, L.

From their “–” placements:
- A has appeared in positions 2, 3, 4 and is not in any of them → A must be in position 5.
- E has appeared in positions 3, 4 and is not in either → E must be in position 2.
- L has appeared in position 2 and is not there → L must be in position 3 or 4.

So the word skeleton is:
C  E  _  _  A   (with L still to place in position 3 or 4).

Possible patterns
1. C E L _ A  → need a single consonant in position 4, not yet used and not ruled out.
   Valid English words fitting CEL_A:
   CELIA (proper noun, invalid)  
   CELLA (archaic term for a storeroom, valid 5-letter English word)  
   CELMA (invalid)  
   Only CELLA works.

2. C E _ L A → need a consonant in position 3, not yet used.
   CE_LA candidates:
   CERLA (invalid), CELLA already covered.
   No other common words.

Therefore CELLA is the only remaining 5-letter word that satisfies all constraints.

(We can double-check: C E L L A — but note it repeats L.  
The feedback rules treat each letter independently; since the secret word must contain A, E, L, and can have at most one L (because L appeared with “–” in Guess 3, implying only one L in the answer), CELLA is invalid due to duplicate L.  
Hence no valid word under pattern 1.)

Re-evaluate: the secret word must contain exactly one A, one E, one L, and start with C.  
Positions forced:
1 C
2 E
5 A

Thus:
C E _ _ A  
L must go in 3 or 4, and we need one more consonant (not R,N,H,S,T) to fill the remaining slot.

- C E L _ A → no valid 5-letter word with this pattern except CELIA (invalid).
- C E _ L A → need consonant in position 3.  
  Fast check of English lexicon:
  C E D L A – invalid  
  C E B L A – invalid  
  C E M L A – invalid  
  C E G L A – invalid  
  C E F L A – invalid  
  C E V L A – invalid  

The only remaining possibility is that the extra consonant is a letter we haven’t used yet.  
Let’s list unused consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning C E _ _ A with L in 3 or 4:

- C E D L A – invalid  
- C E L D A – invalid  
- C E B L A – invalid  
- C E L B A – invalid  
- C E K L A – invalid  
- C E L K A – invalid  
- C E L M A – invalid  
- C E M L A – invalid  

Next most promising unused consonant is K in position 4 with L in 3:
C E L K A – CELKA (invalid).

Only viable candidate that turns up in standard Scrabble/Wordle lexicons is:

CELOA – invalid  
CELIA – invalid  
CELMA – invalid  

Hence the only possible word left appears to be “CELSA” (invalid) — but none of these are recognized.

Recheck: perhaps I misread the “L” feedback.  
In Guess 3 CLEAT, position 2 was L with “–”; that only means L is not in position 2, not necessarily that there is only one L.  The secret word could still have two L’s.

If two L’s are allowed, then CELLA fits: C E L L A.  
In Wordle rules duplicate letters are allowed; the feedback would still show “–” for the second L in position 4 because the single-letter feedback only indicates the count of that letter in the word (one L in this case).  So CELLA satisfies all constraints properly.

Thus CELLA is the only reasonable next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

My goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Good starting words typically:
1. Contain common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Have a balanced vowel/consonant mix

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) with no repeats, and covers both common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:

C(✓) – first letter is definitely C
R(x) – R is not in the word anywhere
A(-) – A exists in the word but not in position 2
N(x) – N is not in the word
E(-) – E exists in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Word pattern: C _ _ _ _
- Letters present: A, E (positions unknown)
- Letters absent: R, N
- Unused letters so far: many, but we should focus on good next guesses that keep C, use A and E elsewhere, and avoid R/N.

Good candidates:
- CHASE – uses C, A, E and avoids R/N, but puts A in position 3 and E in position 5 (both allowed)
- CABLE – but L and B haven't been tested
- CAFEE – invalid (double E)
- CAMEO – uses A, E, but O is new
- CACHE – repeats C, which we know is already correct in position 1, not optimal

CHASE looks solid: it keeps C in position 1, moves A to position 3 (allowed), moves E to position 5 (allowed), and introduces new letters H and S that are common.

3. Letters confirmed present but whose exact positions are still unknown: A and E (each has appeared with “–”, so they’re somewhere in the other four positions 2-5 but not in the spots we tried).

Current template: C _ _ _ _

Positions tried for A and E so far:
- A appeared in position 2 (CRANE) → A ≠ 2
- A appeared in position 3 (CHASE) → A ≠ 3
- E appeared in position 5 (CRANE) → E ≠ 5
- E appeared in position 5 (CHASE) → confirms E ≠ 5

So A must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Possible placements:
Case 1: A in 4 → E could be 2 or 3
Case 2: A in 5 → E could be 2, 3, or 4

- Uses A and E exactly once each in allowed positions

Interpreting the latest feedback:

- C(✓) – still locked in position 1.  
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.  
- L(-) – second L also marked “–” – this implies the secret word contains exactly one L (otherwise the second L would get a ✓ or x).  
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore the secret word has:
- first letter C  
- exactly one L somewhere  
- one A somewhere  
- one E somewhere  
- one more distinct letter (not R, N, H, S, T, and no second L).

Summary constraints:
C _ _ _ _
Positions filled: C(1)
Letters confirmed present: A, E, L (each exactly once)
Letters definitely absent: R, N, H, S, T, plus no second L
Remaining positions for A, E, L: positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but with exclusions:
- A ≠ 5  
- E ≠ 2  
- L ≠ 2 and L ≠ 3  

This leaves the only possible placements:
- A must be in 2, 3 or 4  
- E must be in 3, 4 or 5  
- L must be in 4 or 5  

Let’s list the only valid permutations of A, E, L in the four remaining slots, making sure no duplicates and the extra letter is common and unused yet (unused consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Consider the slot patterns:

1) A in 2 ⇒ pattern C A _ _ _
   - E must be 3 or 4  
   - L must be 4 or 5  
   – If E=3, L must be 4 or 5  
        C A E L _ → need a consonant in 5 (not ruled out): CAEL_ – no word.  
        C A E _ L → need consonant in 4: C A E ? L – CAECL invalid, etc.  
   – If E=4, then L=5  
        C A _ E L → need consonant in 3: C A ? E L → CADEL, CAMEL, CAVEL, etc.  
        CAMEL is a valid word.

2) A in 3 ⇒ pattern C _ A _ _
   - E must be 2, 4 or 5, but E≠2 (from feedback) → 4 or 5  
   - L must be 4 or 5  
   – If E=4, then L=5 → C _ A E L → C B A E L (invalid), C D A E L (invalid), C M A E L (invalid).  
   – If E=5, then L=4 → C _ A L E → C B A L E (invalid), C D A L E (invalid), C M A L E (invalid), C G A L E (invalid), etc.

3) A in 4 ⇒ pattern C _ _ A _
   - E must be 3 or 5 (not 2)  
   - L must be 5 (since L≠2,3 and now A is in 4)  
        So pattern C _ E A L or C _ _ A L with E elsewhere – but L must be 5.  
        C _ E A L → C B E A L (invalid), C D E A L (invalid), C M E A L (invalid).  

Only the first sub-case yielded a valid English word: CAMEL.

Check CAMEL against all constraints:
C(✓) – correct first letter  
A – in word, not in position 5 ✓  
E – in word, not in position 2 ✓  
L – in word, not in positions 2 or 3 ✓  
Letters absent: R,N,H,S,T – none used ✓  
All letters distinct, 5-letter word ✓
