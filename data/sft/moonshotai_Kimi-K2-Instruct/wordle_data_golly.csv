For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular opening choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters which should help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Let’s think of a word that uses these constraints.  
Possible candidates: “POINT” (but has R and S ruled out), “COUNT”, “MOUND”, “CLOUD”, “DOUBT”.  

“COUNT” looks clean:

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Round 2: COUNT → C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word contains the letter O in position 2 (because COUNT gave O(✓) in the second position).
2. The letters A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T are NOT in the word.
3. Therefore, the word is of the form: _ O _ _ _

Remaining vowels to try: I (since we already ruled out A, E, U and O is already used).

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word that fits the pattern _ O _ _ _, uses only the remaining letters, and is a valid English word.

Good candidates:
- B O _ _ _
- D O _ _ _
- F O _ _ _
- H O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- M O _ _ _
- P O _ _ _
- V O _ _ _
- W O _ _ _

Let’s think of common words that fit this pattern:
- BOGUS (but U is ruled out, so no)
- BOTCH (but T is ruled out, so no)
- MOTEL (but T and E are ruled out, so no)
- LODGE (but D, G, E are all okay so far, but we need to check letters used)
- LODGE: letters L, O, D, G, E. E is ruled out, so no.
- FOLIO: letters F, O, L, I, O. O appears twice, which is possible, but let’s check if all letters are available. F, L, I are okay. O is already confirmed. So this is possible.
- POLIO: but P, O, L, I, O. Again, O appears twice. Possible, but let’s see if another word is better.
- WOMAN: but W, O, M, A, N. A and N are ruled out, so no.
- HOLLY: but H, O, L, L, Y. All letters are available (H, L, Y not yet ruled out), but double L is possible.

However, we need to choose a word that maximizes the chance of revealing more letters. FOLIO uses F, L, I, which haven’t been tried yet. It’s also a common word.

Let me verify FOLIO:
- F: not ruled out
- O: confirmed in position 2
- L: not ruled out
- I: not ruled out
- O: already confirmed

Thus, FOLIO seems like a good next guess.

Another option is “FOGGY” but G and Y haven’t been tried. However, FOLIO seems more balanced.

Therefore, I’ll go with FOLIO.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, the word must have O in the second position and cannot contain A, R, S, E, C, U, N, or T. The next best guess to test new valid letters is ""FOXIM"" but that's not a word. Instead, ""FOILS"" uses S which is ruled out. A valid option is ""FOIL"" but it's 4 letters. After reconsidering, ""FOGGY"" uses G and Y which are allowed, but ""FOGGY"" has double G. The cleanest word seems ""FOILS"" but S is out. 

Upon re-evaluating, ""FOILS"" is invalid due to S. Another valid word is ""FOULS"" but U is out. The correct approach is to pick a word that fits _O___ without the ruled-out letters. A valid candidate is ""BOOTH"" but T and H are okay, yet O is in position 2 and T is ruled out. 

The best valid word fitting the constraints is ""BOGGY"" but G is allowed. However, simpler is better. 

The correct valid word is ""FOILS"" is invalid, so ""FOGGY"" is acceptable but let’s pick ""FOXIM"" is invalid. 

Realizing now, the simplest valid word fitting _O___ without ruled letters is ""BOILS"" but S is out. 

After careful rechecking, ""FOIL"" is 4 letters. The actual correct valid word is ""BOILS"" but S is out. 

The proper valid word is ""FOGGY"" but let’s pick ""MOMMY"" which uses M and Y. However, M and Y are allowed, and O is in position 2. 

But ""MOMMY"" has double M which is possible. 

However, the simplest and most valid word is ""BOGGY"" which uses B, O, G, G, Y. All these letters are allowed. 

But to maximize new letters, ""BOGGY"" is acceptable. 

After deeper review, the cleanest valid word fitting _O___ without any ruled letters is ""BOGGY"". 

But another valid word is ""FOGGY"". 

Between these, ""FOGGY"" introduces F and G and Y. 

Thus, the best guess is ""FOGGY"".

Possible candidates: “POINT” (but has R and S ruled out), “COUNT”, “MOUND”, “CLOUD”, “DOUBT”.  

“COUNT” looks clean:  
- C, O, U, N, T.  
- O is in the word and in a different position (position 2 here instead of 3).  
- No A, R, S, or E.  

So a strong next guess is “COUNT”.

<guess>COUNT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Round 2: COUNT → C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)

What we know so far:
1. The word contains the letter O in position 2 (because COUNT gave O(✓) in the second position).
2. The letters A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T are NOT in the word.
3. Therefore, the word is of the form: _ O _ _ _

Remaining vowels to try: I (since we already ruled out A, E, U and O is already used).

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word that fits the pattern _ O _ _ _, uses only the remaining letters, and is a valid English word.

Good candidates:
- B O _ _ _
- D O _ _ _
- F O _ _ _
- H O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- M O _ _ _
- P O _ _ _
- V O _ _ _
- W O _ _ _

Let’s think of common words that fit this pattern:
- BOGUS (but U is ruled out, so no)
- BOTCH (but T is ruled out, so no)
- MOTEL (but T and E are ruled out, so no)
- LODGE (but D, G, E are all okay so far, but we need to check letters used)
- LODGE: letters L, O, D, G, E. E is ruled out, so no.
- FOLIO: letters F, O, L, I, O. O appears twice, which is possible, but let’s check if all letters are available. F, L, I are okay. O is already confirmed. So this is possible.
- POLIO: but P, O, L, I, O. Again, O appears twice. Possible, but let’s see if another word is better.
- WOMAN: but W, O, M, A, N. A and N are ruled out, so no.
- HOLLY: but H, O, L, L, Y. All letters are available (H, L, Y not yet ruled out), but double L is possible.

However, we need to choose a word that maximizes the chance of revealing more letters. FOLIO uses F, L, I, which haven’t been tried yet. It’s also a common word.

Let me verify FOLIO:
- F: not ruled out
- O: confirmed in position 2
- L: not ruled out
- I: not ruled out
- O: already confirmed

Thus, FOLIO seems like a good next guess.

Another option is “FOGGY” but G and Y haven’t been tried. However, FOLIO seems more balanced.

Therefore, I’ll go with FOLIO.Based on the feedback so far, the word must have O in the second position and cannot contain A, R, S, E, C, U, N, or T. The next best guess to test new valid letters is ""FOXIM"" but that's not a word. Instead, ""FOILS"" uses S which is ruled out. A valid option is ""FOIL"" but it's 4 letters. After reconsidering, ""FOGGY"" uses G and Y which are allowed, but ""FOGGY"" has double G. The cleanest word seems ""FOILS"" but S is out. 

Upon re-evaluating, ""FOILS"" is invalid due to S. Another valid word is ""FOULS"" but U is out. The correct approach is to pick a word that fits _O___ without the ruled-out letters. A valid candidate is ""BOOTH"" but T and H are okay, yet O is in position 2 and T is ruled out. 

The best valid word fitting the constraints is ""BOGGY"" but G is allowed. However, simpler is better. 

The correct valid word is ""FOILS"" is invalid, so ""FOGGY"" is acceptable but let’s pick ""FOXIM"" is invalid. 

Realizing now, the simplest valid word fitting _O___ without ruled letters is ""BOILS"" but S is out. 

After careful rechecking, ""FOIL"" is 4 letters. The actual correct valid word is ""BOILS"" but S is out. 

The proper valid word is ""FOGGY"" but let’s pick ""MOMMY"" which uses M and Y. However, M and Y are allowed, and O is in position 2. 

But ""MOMMY"" has double M which is possible. 

However, the simplest and most valid word is ""BOGGY"" which uses B, O, G, G, Y. All these letters are allowed. 

But to maximize new letters, ""BOGGY"" is acceptable. 

After deeper review, the cleanest valid word fitting _O___ without any ruled letters is ""BOGGY"". 

But another valid word is ""FOGGY"". 

Between these, ""FOGGY"" introduces F and G and Y. 

Thus, the best guess is ""FOGGY"".

From the three rounds we now know:

- Position 2 is O (COUNT and FOGGY both gave O(✓)).
- Position 5 is Y (FOGGY gave Y(✓)).
- The letters A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T, F are NOT in the word.
- G appears in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (FOGGY gave G(-) for both G’s).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y   
and the word must contain G once (not in positions 3 or 4).

Possible positions for G:
- Position 1 or 5.  
  But position 5 is already Y, so G must be in position 1.

Hence the word must be: G O _ _ Y

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, D, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z, and so on.

We need two more letters (positions 3 & 4) that:
- Are not any of the already-excluded letters.
- Do not violate any feedback.

The simplest common word that fits G O _ _ Y is “GOOPY”, but P is allowed and O is already in position 2, yet double O is possible; but “GOODY” uses letters D, Y already in place.

A quick check of valid English 5-letter words gives “GOODY” (G O O D Y) – but double O is allowed and D has not been ruled out. All letters are allowed.

Another candidate is “GOLLY” (G O L L Y) – double L allowed.

But “GOODY” uses D which is a new letter.

Thus, “GOODY” seems a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular opening choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters which should help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

So our secret word:

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular opening choice because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (the most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us coverage of 5 different common letters which should help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is NOT in the word (x)\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo our secret word:\n- Contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E at all.\n\nWe now need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has an O somewhere other than the third letter.\n- Does not contain A, R, S, or E.\n\nGood consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, P, M, H, etc.\nGood vowels: I, U (since A and E are ruled out).\n\nLet’s think of a word that uses these constraints.  \nPossible candidates: “POINT” (but has R and S ruled out), “COUNT”, “MOUND”, “CLOUD”, “DOUBT”.  \n\n“COUNT” looks clean:  \n- C, O, U, N, T.  \n- O is in the word and in a different position (position 2 here instead of 3).  \n- No A, R, S, or E.  \n\nSo a strong next guess is “COUNT”.\n\n<guess>COUNT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have two rounds of feedback.\n\nRound 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nRound 2: COUNT → C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n1. The word contains the letter O in position 2 (because COUNT gave O(✓) in the second position).\n2. The letters A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T are NOT in the word.\n3. Therefore, the word is of the form: _ O _ _ _\n\nRemaining vowels to try: I (since we already ruled out A, E, U and O is already used).\n\nRemaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a five-letter word that fits the pattern _ O _ _ _, uses only the remaining letters, and is a valid English word.\n\nGood candidates:\n- B O _ _ _\n- D O _ _ _\n- F O _ _ _\n- H O _ _ _\n- L O _ _ _\n- M O _ _ _\n- P O _ _ _\n- V O _ _ _\n- W O _ _ _\n\nLet’s think of common words that fit this pattern:\n- BOGUS (but U is ruled out, so no)\n- BOTCH (but T is ruled out, so no)\n- MOTEL (but T and E are ruled out, so no)\n- LODGE (but D, G, E are all okay so far, but we need to check letters used)\n- LODGE: letters L, O, D, G, E. E is ruled out, so no.\n- FOLIO: letters F, O, L, I, O. O appears twice, which is possible, but let’s check if all letters are available. F, L, I are okay. O is already confirmed. So this is possible.\n- POLIO: but P, O, L, I, O. Again, O appears twice. Possible, but let’s see if another word is better.\n- WOMAN: but W, O, M, A, N. A and N are ruled out, so no.\n- HOLLY: but H, O, L, L, Y. All letters are available (H, L, Y not yet ruled out), but double L is possible.\n\nHowever, we need to choose a word that maximizes the chance of revealing more letters. FOLIO uses F, L, I, which haven’t been tried yet. It’s also a common word.\n\nLet me verify FOLIO:\n- F: not ruled out\n- O: confirmed in position 2\n- L: not ruled out\n- I: not ruled out\n- O: already confirmed\n\nThus, FOLIO seems like a good next guess.\n\nAnother option is “FOGGY” but G and Y haven’t been tried. However, FOLIO seems more balanced.\n\nTherefore, I’ll go with FOLIO.Based on the feedback so far, the word must have O in the second position and cannot contain A, R, S, E, C, U, N, or T. The next best guess to test new valid letters is ""FOXIM"" but that\'s not a word. Instead, ""FOILS"" uses S which is ruled out. A valid option is ""FOIL"" but it\'s 4 letters. After reconsidering, ""FOGGY"" uses G and Y which are allowed, but ""FOGGY"" has double G. The cleanest word seems ""FOILS"" but S is out. \n\nUpon re-evaluating, ""FOILS"" is invalid due to S. Another valid word is ""FOULS"" but U is out. The correct approach is to pick a word that fits _O___ without the ruled-out letters. A valid candidate is ""BOOTH"" but T and H are okay, yet O is in position 2 and T is ruled out. \n\nThe best valid word fitting the constraints is ""BOGGY"" but G is allowed. However, simpler is better. \n\nThe correct valid word is ""FOILS"" is invalid, so ""FOGGY"" is acceptable but let’s pick ""FOXIM"" is invalid. \n\nRealizing now, the simplest valid word fitting _O___ without ruled letters is ""BOILS"" but S is out. \n\nAfter careful rechecking, ""FOIL"" is 4 letters. The actual correct valid word is ""BOILS"" but S is out. \n\nThe proper valid word is ""FOGGY"" but let’s pick ""MOMMY"" which uses M and Y. However, M and Y are allowed, and O is in position 2. \n\nBut ""MOMMY"" has double M which is possible. \n\nHowever, the simplest and most valid word is ""BOGGY"" which uses B, O, G, G, Y. All these letters are allowed. \n\nBut to maximize new letters, ""BOGGY"" is acceptable. \n\nAfter deeper review, the cleanest valid word fitting _O___ without any ruled letters is ""BOGGY"". \n\nBut another valid word is ""FOGGY"". \n\nBetween these, ""FOGGY"" introduces F and G and Y. \n\nThus, the best guess is ""FOGGY"".\n\n<guess>FOGGY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: FOGGY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) G(-) G(-) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the three rounds we now know:\n\n- Position 2 is O (COUNT and FOGGY both gave O(✓)).\n- Position 5 is Y (FOGGY gave Y(✓)).\n- The letters A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T, F are NOT in the word.\n- G appears in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (FOGGY gave G(-) for both G’s).\n\nSo the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y   \nand the word must contain G once (not in positions 3 or 4).\n\nPossible positions for G:\n- Position 1 or 5.  \n  But position 5 is already Y, so G must be in position 1.\n\nHence the word must be: G O _ _ Y\n\nLetters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, D, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z, and so on.\n\nWe need two more letters (positions 3 & 4) that:\n- Are not any of the already-excluded letters.\n- Do not violate any feedback.\n\nThe simplest common word that fits G O _ _ Y is “GOOPY”, but P is allowed and O is already in position 2, yet double O is possible; but “GOODY” uses letters D, Y already in place.\n\nA quick check of valid English 5-letter words gives “GOODY” (G O O D Y) – but double O is allowed and D has not been ruled out.

From every round so far we now know:

1. Position 2 = O (✓ from both COUNT and FOGGY).
2. Position 5 = Y (✓ from FOGGY).
3. Position 1 = G (✓ from GOODY).
4. The letters NOT in the word are: A, R, S, E, C, U, N, T, F, D.

So the pattern is: G O _ _ Y

The two missing letters (positions 3 and 4) must be from the still-allowed set:
B, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z

Also, position 3 cannot be O (GOODY gave O(-) for the third letter).

Scanning common 5-letter English words of the form GO _ _ Y:

- GOLLY  (L, L both allowed)
- GUMMY  (M, M both allowed)
- GOBBY  (B used twice, but B is allowed)
- GOOFY  – already contains F and O again, which is ruled out.
- GOOPY  – P is allowed, but double O is already rejected.

“GOLLY” is a valid, common word using only allowed letters and satisfying every constraint.
