For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence. A good starting word uses frequent vowels and consonants. Popular choices include:

- Words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
- Avoiding letters that are less frequent (like Q, X, Z).

Options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" are often recommended. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and two vowels.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A are NOT in the word (marked 'x').
- T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked '-').

So the secret word contains both T and E, but T is NOT in position 4 and E is NOT in position 5.

Next step: choose a word that
- uses T and E in new positions,
- avoids S, L, A,
- and introduces a fresh set of common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- T and E must be placed elsewhere.
- Good consonants to test: R, N, C, H, etc.
- Good vowels to test: I, O, U.

For example, “RETCH” (R,E,T,C,H) places T in position 3 and E in position 2. Another option is “NICER” but it doesn’t include T. “TEMPO” has T in 1st position but we don’t know if that’s allowed yet. 
Let’s try “NICET” – valid, uses T in position 5 (but E is currently in position 5 and was rejected, so T in 5 is ok). However, E is in position 4 here, which is different from the original position 5. This seems acceptable.

Actually, “NICET” is a poor choice because T is again in position 5 where E was before, but that’s fine. Let’s go with “NICET”.

Wait, no: “NICET” is not a valid English word (it’s the name of a test but not common). Let’s pick “ENTER” – valid, uses E in positions 1 and 3, T in 4. But T cannot be in 4 (was in 4 in SLATE and got '-'). So T must avoid 4. “ENTER” has T in 4 – discard.

Alternative: “TREND” – T in 1, E in 3, no S,L,A. Valid word.

I’ll go with “TREND”.
