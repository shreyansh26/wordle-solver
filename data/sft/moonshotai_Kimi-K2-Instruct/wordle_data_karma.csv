For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving us maximum information

This should help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word and their approximate positions.

Summary of what we now know:
Letters definitely in the word: A, R (both in wrong positions so far).
Letters definitely out: O, S, E, T, I, N.

We need a word that:
1. Contains A and R (and keeps each in a new position).
2. Avoids all eliminated letters: O, S, E, T, I, N.
3. Introduces fresh, common letters not yet tested.

Available consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels not yet ruled out: U (since A is already confirmed, and we ruled out O, E, I).

Let’s build a candidate:
- A and R must appear, but not in their previous spots:
  – A was in positions 1 and 3, so it can be in 2, 4, or 5.
  – R was in positions 2 and 2, so it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

- We’d like to include at least one new, common consonant not yet used. Good choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y. Among these, B, D, L, M, C, P are very frequent.

- We also need to fill three more slots and have only U left as a new vowel if needed.

A simple pattern that satisfies these constraints:
Put R in position 1, A in position 2, and fill the remaining three slots with new consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

Example: R A _ _ _
We can try R, A, B, U, L → ""RABAL"" (but not an English word).

How about R, A, B, U, D → ""RABUD"" (also not valid).

Instead, let’s aim for a known common word that uses A and R in new positions, with only remaining letters.

Consider “BURLY” – but it uses Y and we don’t know about Y yet, plus it doesn’t contain A.

Wait, let’s try a systematic approach: list common 5-letter words that contain A and R, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: O, S, E, T, I, N.

Valid letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, R.

Let’s pick “CRANK” – but N is out.

“GRASP” – S is out.

“BARKY” – contains A, R, and only uses letters not yet ruled out (B, K, Y).

Check positions:
- A not in 1 or 3, so 2, 4, or 5. In BARKY, A is in position 2 – acceptable.
- R not in 2, so 1, 3, 4, or 5. In BARKY, R is in position 3 – acceptable.

From the new feedback on ""barky"":
- B(x) – B is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in position 2 and it is CORRECT.
- R(✓) – R is in position 3 and it is CORRECT.
- K(-) – K is in the word but in the WRONG position (currently position 4).
- Y(x) – Y is NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Fixed letters: A in position 2, R in position 3.
- Letters that must appear somewhere else: K.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N, B, Y.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): A, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, R (but R is already placed).

Structure so far: _ A R _ _

We need to place K somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5) and fill the remaining two slots with unused letters.

Let’s list common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _ and contain K.

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K A R _ _  → KAR_ _  (e.g., KARMA, KARST – but S is out, so KARMA)
- Position 4: _ A R K _  → e.g., DARK_, HARK_, LARK_, MARK_, PARK_, WARK_ (but W is allowed, yet ""WARK"" is uncommon)
- Position 5: _ A R _ K  → e.g., DAR_K, HAR_K, LAR_K, MAR_K, PAR_K (but none are common words)

From these, the most common valid words are:
- KARMA (but second M is new, not ruled out)
- DARK_ – but we need a 5-letter word, so ""DARK?"" – ""DARKS"" (but S out), ""DARKY"" (Y out), so no.
- HARK_ – ""HARKS"" (S out), ""HARKY"" (Y out) – no.
- LARK_ – ""LARKS"" (S out), ""LARKY"" (Y out) – no.
- MARK_ – same issue.
- PARK_ – same.

Instead, let’s look for _ A R _ _ words without K in position 4 or 5, but ensuring K is elsewhere. Actually, K must appear, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Looking at K A R _ _ : ""KARMA"" is valid (letters: K, A, R, M, A – but A is already in position 2, and we can have repeat letters unless ruled out. No rule against repeats, and M is not ruled out).

""KARMA"" fits:
- K in 1 (not ruled out)
- A in 2 (correct)
- R in 3 (correct)
- M in 4 (not ruled out)
- A in 5 (not ruled out, and A can repeat)

Another option: ""FARAD"" – but D is allowed, but no K.
We need K, so ""KARMA"" seems best.

Alternatively, ""KARAT"" – but T is out.
""KARMA"" is the only common word fitting.

Let me check if there are others: ""HARAK"" – no, not a word.
""PARAS"" – no K.
""CARAT"" – no K.
""GARAM"" – no K.

So ""KARMA"" seems the only reasonable choice that includes K and fits the fixed A and R.

Let me verify letters:
- K: allowed (not ruled out)
- A: allowed (already in correct spot)
- R: allowed (already in correct spot)
- M: allowed (not ruled out)
- A: allowed (can repeat)

Thus, ""KARMA"" is a valid next guess.
