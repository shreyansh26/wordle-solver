For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any.

One such word that fits this criteria is ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, and E - all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on these letters and help narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Let’s digest the new feedback:

- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, I, S, E, T, N  
Letters we know ARE in the word (positions unknown): R, U, O

Remaining common letters we have not yet tried: C, L, D, P, M, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, U, and O, does not contain A, I, S, E, T, N, and places each of R, U, O in a spot they haven’t been ruled out of (R ≠ 1,3, U ≠ 2, O ≠ 5).

One such word: “CORNY” – but Y is less common; let’s try “FRUIT” – but T is out.  
Another candidate: “GROUP” – uses G, R, O, U, P and satisfies the constraints:
- Contains R, U, O.
- No A, I, S, E, T, N.
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- U is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (allowed).

From the latest feedback:

- GR O U P  
  G (x) – G is not in the word.  
  R (✓) – R is in position 2 and is correct.  
  O (✓) – O is in position 3 and is correct.  
  U (✓) – U is in position 4 and is correct.  
  P (-) – P is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters in the secret word (in their exact spots):
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: U

Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed:
- P (must appear somewhere other than position 5)

Letters already ruled out:
A, I, S, E, T, N, G

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2, O in position 3, U in position 4.
2. Contains the letter P somewhere other than position 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

The pattern is: _ R O U _

We need a first letter and a fifth letter, and the letter P must fit somewhere.

Since positions 2-4 are fixed as R O U, the only place P can appear is position 1 or 5, but P cannot be in position 5 (from feedback), so P must be in position 1.

Thus the word is P R O U ?

We need a fifth letter that:
- Is not in the banned list (A, I, S, E, T, N, G).
- Has not been used in any guess yet (so not R, O, U, P).
- Forms a valid 5-letter English word.

The only letter that fits here is D, forming the word ""PROUD"".

Let's verify:
- P in position 1: allowed (not ruled out).
- R in position 2: correct.
- O in position 3: correct.
- U in position 4: correct.
- D in position 5: new letter, not banned.

This satisfies all constraints.

<guess>PROUD</guess>",PROUD,"From the latest feedback:

- GR O U P  
  G (x) – G is not in the word.  
  R (✓) – R is in position 2 and is correct.  
  O (✓) – O is in position 3 and is correct.  
  U (✓) – U is in position 4 and is correct.  
  P (-) – P is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters in the secret word (in their exact spots):
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: U

Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed:
- P (must appear somewhere other than position 5)

Letters already ruled out:
A, I, S, E, T, N, G

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2, O in position 3, U in position 4.
2. Contains the letter P somewhere other than position 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

The pattern is: _ R O U _
