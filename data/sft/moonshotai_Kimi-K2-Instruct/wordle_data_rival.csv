For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

However, another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" which covers the very common S, L, T along with A and E. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it has slightly better vowel coverage which might be more helpful early on.

From the feedback:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first).
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (so not second).
O(x) – O is not in the word.
S(x) – S is not in the word.
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word (but misplaced): A and R.
- Letters that are definitely out: O, S, E.

Therefore, the secret word contains both A and R (but neither in the positions they occupied in AROSE), and does **not** contain O, S, or E.

A good next step is to place the known letters in new positions and try other common, untested letters.

I’ll try to put A in position 2 and R in position 4, while avoiding the eliminated letters.
A word that fits is “BRAND” (B, R, A, N, D). Let’s check:
- B – new letter.
- R in position 2 (was originally in position 2, but feedback says R is wrong in position 2 in “AROSE”; so R in position 2 is still wrong).  
Oops, that violates the constraint. R cannot be in position 2.

Let me re-think placement of A and R. A must not be 1st; R must not be 2nd.

A good candidate is “RAIND” but that has E (invalid).  
“RANCH” – has H (new letter), positions: R is now 1st (allowed, since original R was 2nd). A is 2nd (allowed, original A was 1st). C, H, N are new letters. No O, S, E.

“RANCH” looks valid.

Let’s double-check:
- R is in word but not 2nd – ok here (position 1).
- A is in word but not 1st – ok here (position 2).
- No O, S, E – correct.

Summary of current constraints:

Another approach: look for common words starting with R and having A in positions 3-5, avoiding forbidden letters.

Examples:
- R A Z O R → contains O (forbidden).
