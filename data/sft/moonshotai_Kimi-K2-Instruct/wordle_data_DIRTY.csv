For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants.

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word.

Some good candidates are: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, ROAST, etc. 

""STARE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common
- T is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- R is very common
- E is the most common letter overall

This combination should give us maximum information about what letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) → S is **not** in the word.  
- T(-) → T **is** in the word **but not in position 2**.  
- A(x) → A is **not** in the word.  
- R(-) → R **is** in the word **but not in position 4**.  
- E(x) → E is **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- Must include T and R.
- Cannot include S, A, E.
- Possible positions for T: 1,3,4,5.
- Possible positions for R: 1,2,3,5.

A good next guess should:
1. Place T and R in new positions.
2. Introduce other common letters that haven’t been eliminated yet (like O, I, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A promising word that satisfies these constraints is “TRIOL” (T in position 1, R in position 2, I and O in positions 3 and 4). However, “TRIOL” is not a valid English word.

Another valid option is “DROIT” (D, R, O, I, T), which uses all the required letters in new positions, but T is back in position 5.

Another valid word is “NITRO” (N, I, T, R, O), which places T in position 3 and R in position 4.

This seems like a strong choice because:
- T is in position 3 (was position 2 in STARE).
- R is in position 4 (was position 4 in STARE, but feedback said R is in the word but not in position 4, so this contradicts). Wait — that feedback said R(-), which means R is in the word but **not** in position 4. So R cannot be in position 4.

Let me rethink. A better word is “INTRO”:
- I, N, T, R, O.
- T is in position 3 (new position).
- R is in position 4 — but this violates the feedback because R cannot be in position 4.

Next, “TORSI” (T, O, R, S, I), but S is already ruled out.

“TORCH” (T, O, R, C, H) — H is less common, but T is in position 1 (new), R is in position 3.

“FRONT” (F, R, O, N, T) — R is in position 2, T is in position 5. Both positions are new for these letters.

This seems like the best choice so far because:
- T is in position 5 (new position, previously was 2).
- R is in position 2 (new position, previously was 4, and feedback said R is not in 4, so 2 is allowed).
- F, O, N are new letters that could help narrow down the possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

1. STARE: S(x) T(-) A(x) R(-) E(x)  
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – No A, E, S in the word.

2. FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) T(-)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – T is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – No F, O, N in the word.

Combining these facts:
- Letters we **know** are in the word: T, R.  
- Letters we **know** are **not** in the word: A, E, S, F, O, N.  
- Allowed positions for T: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  
- Allowed positions for R: 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).

We still need to fill three more slots with letters that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common consonants are D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc., and the only vowel not yet ruled out is I (U and Y are possible but less common).

Let’s try to form a word that places T and R in new valid positions and introduces new letters.

We can attempt:
- R in 1, T in 3 → R _ T _ _
- R in 1, T in 4 → R _ _ T _
- R in 3, T in 1 → T _ R _ _
- R in 3, T in 4 → _ _ R T _
- R in 5, T in 1 → T _ _ _ R
- R in 5, T in 3 → _ _ T _ R

Let’s pick R _ T _ _ and see if we can form a word.  
A valid word with R in position 1, T in position 3: R I T C H (but H is low-frequency), R I T Z A (invalid), R I T U E (invalid), R I T T Y (invalid).

Next, try T _ R _ _.  
Possible: T I R E D (but E is ruled out), T I R K S (invalid).  

Next, try _ _ T _ R.  
Possible: B I T E R (but E is ruled out), C A T C H (A is ruled out), D I T T O (O is ruled out), D I T C H (D I T C H – letters are D, I, T, C, H; none are ruled out except O and N are already excluded).  
A valid word here is D I T C H, which uses D, I, T, C, H. All these letters are still possible.

Let’s check positions:
- T in position 3 (valid).  
- R is not in this word – but we know R **must** be in the word. So DITCH is invalid because it lacks R.

Next attempt: R in 5, T in 3 → _ _ T _ R.  
We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4 with letters not ruled out, and include R in 5.  
Letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

A valid word with T in 3 and R in 5:  
B U T C R (invalid), C I T Y R (invalid), D I T T R (invalid), L I T C R (invalid), W I T C H (but R is missing), M I T R E (but E is ruled out), P I T C H (R is missing), V I T R O (O is ruled out), B R I T R (invalid), C R I T T (invalid).

Hmm, the pattern _ _ T _ R seems hard. Let’s try R in 3, T in 1 → T _ R _ _.  
We need a valid 5-letter word: T A R G E (A and E ruled out), T I R E D (E ruled out), T O R C H (O ruled out), T U R N S (N and S ruled out), T R I P S (S ruled out), T R A C K (A ruled out), T R I C K (valid – T R I C K).  

TRICK: T in 1 (valid), R in 2 (but feedback from FRONT said R cannot be in 2) – so invalid.

Next, try R in 3, T in 4 → _ _ R T _.  
Possible: C I R T H (invalid), D I R T Y (valid – D I R T Y).  
Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y. None are ruled out except O, N, S, A, E, F.  
Check positions:  
- R in 3 (valid, only ruled out for 2 and 4).  
- T in 4 (valid, only ruled out for 2 and 5).  
- D, I, Y are new and not ruled out.  

DIRTY seems valid. Let me confirm:
- D: not ruled out.  
- I: not ruled out.  
- R: required, in position 3.  
- T: required, in position 4.  
- Y: not ruled out.  

DIRTY fits all constraints.

   – No A, E, S in the word.

2. FRONT: F(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) T(-)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – T is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – No F, O, N in the word.

Combining these facts:
- Letters we **know** are in the word: T, R.  
- Letters we **know** are **not** in the word: A, E, S, F, O, N.  
- Allowed positions for T: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  
- Allowed positions for R: 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).

We still need to fill three more slots with letters that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common consonants are D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc., and the only vowel not yet ruled out is I (U and Y are possible but less common).

Let’s try to form a word that places T and R in new valid positions and introduces new letters.

We can attempt:
- R in 1, T in 3 → R _ T _ _
- R in 1, T in 4 → R _ _ T _
- R in 3, T in 1 → T _ R _ _
- R in 3, T in 4 → _ _ R T _
- R in 5, T in 1 → T _ _ _ R
- R in 5, T in 3 → _ _ T _ R

Let’s pick R _ T _ _ and see if we can form a word.  
A valid word with R in position 1, T in position 3: R I T C H (but H is low-frequency), R I T Z A (invalid), R I T U E (invalid), R I T T Y (invalid).

Next, try T _ R _ _.  
Possible: T I R E D (but E is ruled out), T I R K S (invalid).  

Next, try _ _ T _ R.  
Possible: B I T E R (but E is ruled out), C A T C H (A is ruled out), D I T T O (O is ruled out), D I T C H (D I T C H – letters are D, I, T, C, H; none are ruled out except O and N are already excluded).  
A valid word here is D I T C H, which uses D, I, T, C, H. All these letters are still possible.

Let’s check positions:
- T in position 3 (valid).  
- R is not in this word – but we know R **must** be in the word. So DITCH is invalid because it lacks R.

Next attempt: R in 5, T in 3 → _ _ T _ R.  
We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4 with letters not ruled out, and include R in 5.  
Letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

A valid word with T in 3 and R in 5:  
B U T C R (invalid), C I T Y R (invalid), D I T T R (invalid), L I T C R (invalid), W I T C H (but R is missing), M I T R E (but E is ruled out), P I T C H (R is missing), V I T R O (O is ruled out), B R I T R (invalid), C R I T T (invalid).

Hmm, the pattern _ _ T _ R seems hard. Let’s try R in 3, T in 1 → T _ R _ _.  
We need a valid 5-letter word: T A R G E (A and E ruled out), T I R E D (E ruled out), T O R C H (O ruled out), T U R N S (N and S ruled out), T R I P S (S ruled out), T R A C K (A ruled out), T R I C K (valid – T R I C K).  

TRICK: T in 1 (valid), R in 2 (but feedback from FRONT said R cannot be in 2) – so invalid.

Next, try R in 3, T in 4 → _ _ R T _.  
Possible: C I R T H (invalid), D I R T Y (valid – D I R T Y).  
Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y. None are ruled out except O, N, S, A, E, F.  
Check positions:  
- R in 3 (valid, only ruled out for 2 and 4).  
- T in 4 (valid, only ruled out for 2 and 5).  
- D, I, Y are new and not ruled out.  

DIRTY seems valid. Let me confirm:
- D: not ruled out.  
- I: not ruled out.  
- R: required, in position 3.  
- T: required, in position 4.  
- Y: not ruled out.  

DIRTY fits all constraints.",Guess 3: DIRTY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
