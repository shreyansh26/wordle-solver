1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly gather information about the secret word. I'll pick ""AROSE"" because:
1. It contains five very common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, so this will likely give us good feedback
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S) to maximize information gain

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
- Contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses R in a different position (not 2nd).
2. Avoids A, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep exploring.

Good candidate letters left: R, I, T, N, U, L, D, C, M, etc.

Aiming for positions 1 or 3-5 for R, I'll try a word like ""TRUNK"":
- T, R, U, N, K: none of these are in the forbidden set (A, O, S, E).
- R is in position 2 again (same as before), but that was already ruled out.

Oops, R should not be in position 2. Let me pick ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T: all allowed letters.
- R is in position 2 again – still bad.

Better: ""RIGHT"":
- R in position 1, which is allowed.
- G, H are new consonants; I is a new vowel.

""RIGHT"" seems good.

Candidate structure: _ I _ _ _

Possible letters for the remaining slots: D, N, L, C, U, M, R, T, etc.

To cover new letters efficiently, try a word like DIRTN? Not valid.  
DRINK? Uses R in 1st (forbidden in this slot).  
CRISP? Uses S (forbidden).  
TRIUM? T is in 5th (forbidden).  

Try “TRILL” – but L repeats and T is last.  
“TRUNK” – U is OK, N and K are new, but T is first (no restriction yet) and R is second (forbidden).  

Better: “TRIAD” – but A is forbidden.  
“TRIBE” – E is forbidden.  

Wait, simple word: “DRIFT”  
- D, R, I, F, T  
- I is in position 3? No, must be position 2.  
- So structure _ I _ _ _

Try “BRIDE” – B, R, I, D, E; E is forbidden.  
“PRIMO” – O forbidden.

“FRUIT” – U, I, T but R is second (forbidden).

Wait, need I in position 2. So _ I _ _ _

Word must be like C I _ _ _ or D I _ _ _ etc.

“CIRCA” – A forbidden.  
“DIRTY” – T at 4 (allowed), Y unused.  
“FILMY” – F, I, L, M, Y. No T or R covered.
