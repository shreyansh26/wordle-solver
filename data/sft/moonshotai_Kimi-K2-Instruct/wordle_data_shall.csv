For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me the best chance to get hits on letters early.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

Both are good, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's more vowel-heavy initially.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1)
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate should also try new common consonants to maximize information. The word ""SAINT"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so this is a new position)
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before, so this is a new position)
- I (new vowel to test)
- N and T (new common consonants)

This should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

So the secret word so far:
- Starts with S.  
- Contains A (must be in positions 3, 4, or 5).  
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N, T.  
- Still need to place A and find the remaining two letters.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (the only one not yet tried).

A productive next word is one that:
- Keeps S in position 1.  
- Places A in a new position (3, 4, or 5).  
- Introduces new high-frequency consonants.

“SCALD” is attractive: it has S, C, A, L, D — all permissible letters — and moves A to position 3 while adding two new consonants. However, “L” is sometimes considered a bit less common than others. Another good choice is “SCAMP” but P and M are both new and common. 

I’ll go with “SCAMP” because M and P are both high-value consonants to test early.

But wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid. Let’s double-check:  
- S ✓ (position 1)

A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me the best chance to get hits on letters early.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which has:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common ending letter)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nBoth are good, but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it\'s more vowel-heavy initially.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is not in the word at all.\n- O is not in the word at all.\n- S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A (but not in position 1)\n- Contains S (but not in position 4)\n- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate should also try new common consonants to maximize information. The word ""SAINT"" comes to mind:\n- S in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so this is a new position)\n- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before, so this is a new position)\n- I (new vowel to test)\n- N and T (new common consonants)\n\nThis should help narrow down the possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>SAINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

Another good choice is “SCAMP” but P and M are both new and common. \n\nI’ll go with “SCAMP” because M and P are both high-value consonants to test early.\n\nBut wait: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

Current constraints from all feedback:

1. Letters we know are in the word and their exact positions:
   - S is in position 1 (✓ in SCAMP).
   - A is in position 3 (✓ in SCAMP).

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word:
   R, O, E, I, N, T, C, M, P.

3. Remaining unknown positions: 2 and 4.
   Allowed letters so far must exclude the ruled-out ones and must not have A, S in any other positions.

4. Still need to place valid letters in positions 2 and 4.
   Remaining consonants not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Remaining vowels not yet tried: U (since A is already used in position 3).

5. We also know:
   - A is only in position 3 (from SCAMP feedback), so it won't appear elsewhere.
   - S is only in position 1.

6. Possible valid letters for positions 2 and 4:
   - Position 2: Can be any consonant except R, C, M, P, T, N, etc. Common ones: B, D, G, H, L, etc.
   - Position 4: Similarly, any consonant not ruled out.

7. We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in position 3, and uses only the remaining letters.

   Some possibilities:
   - S B A D ?
   - S L A B ?
   - S H A L ?
   - S G A L ?
   - S B A G ?

   Let me think of actual words:
   - S B A D _ → SBAD? (invalid)
   - S L A B _ → SLAB? (valid word)
   - S H A L _ → SHALE (but E is ruled out), SHAL_ → SHAL_ is not a word.

   - S D A B ? → SDAB_ (invalid)
   - S L A D ? → SLAD_ (invalid)
   - S B A L ? → SBAL_ (invalid)
   - S L A G ? → SLAG (4 letters, need 5)
   - S L A B S (but S is already used in position 1 and can't be in 5)
   - S L A B Y → SLABY (valid? Not sure, but SLABS is plural, ends with S which is already used)
   - S B A L D → SBALD (invalid)
   - S B A L K → SBALK (invalid)
   - S B A L L → SBALL (invalid)
   - S B A L M → SBALM (invalid)

   Another approach: position 2 and 4 must be consonants from remaining letters. Let's try:
   - S _ A _ _
   - Maybe S B A L K → SBALK (invalid)
   - S B A L D → SBALD (invalid)
   - S B A L K → SBALK (invalid)
   - S B A L L → SBALL (invalid)
   - S B A L K → SBALK (invalid)
   - S B A L L → SBALL (invalid)

   Wait, let's list remaining valid consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Need to form a valid word with S _ A _ _.

   Possible words:
   - S B A L D (invalid)

   - S G A L L (invalid)
   - S D A L K (invalid)
   - S B A L K (invalid)

   Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a word. Let me think differently: position 2 and 4 can be any remaining consonants. Maybe:
   - S B A L D → SBALD (no)
   - S B A L K → SBALK (no)
   - S B A L L → SBALL (no)
   - S L A B S → invalid (S already used)
   - S L A B Y → SLABY (no)
   - S L A B S → no
   - S L A B Y → no

   Maybe the word is S B A L L → SBALL is not a word. 

   Let me try S H A L L → SHALL. This is a valid word, and checks:
   - S in 1: ✓
   - H: new letter, allowed
   - A in 3: ✓
   - L: new letter, allowed
   - L: new letter, allowed

   SHALL fits all constraints:
   - Starts with S.
   - A in position 3.
   - Uses only letters not ruled out (H, L).
   - Does not use any excluded letters.

   Therefore, SHALL is a valid next guess.

Based on the feedback so far:
- S is in position 1.
- A is in position 3.
- R, O, E, I, N, T, C, M, P are not in the word.

The only remaining common consonants are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, etc. The word ""SHALL"" fits these rules perfectly.
