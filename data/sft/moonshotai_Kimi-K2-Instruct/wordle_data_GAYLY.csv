This is the first guess, so there's no feedback to analyze yet. The goal is to choose a strategic starting word that will give maximum information. Good first guesses typically include common vowels and consonants. Popular choices like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are common, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers all five vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S), giving a broad initial test of the secret word's letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
So I know:
1. The word has an A, but not in the 1st position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. The remaining letters yet to test include common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc., and the vowels I, U (since E, O are out and A is already found).

I should now pick a word that:
- Contains A in a different position.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Good candidates include:
- TAINT (uses T, N, I)
- PLAIN (uses P, L, N, I)
- CHAIN (uses C, H, N, I)
- PAINT (uses P, N, I, T)

Among these, PAINT covers P, N, I, T plus the known A, giving a broad test of new letters while placing A in position 2.

From the two prior guesses we know:

1. A is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 2 (PAINT → A✓).
2. The letters R, O, S, E (from AROSE) and P, I, N, T (from PAINT) are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _

Remaining letters to test should include the consonants and vowels not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to determine:
- What letters are in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- Whether the remaining vowels U or Y (sometimes used as a vowel) are present.

A strategic next guess would:
- Keep A in position 2.
- Introduce several new, common letters, especially those that can appear in clusters (like L, C, K, D, M, B).
- Prefer placing new vowels in remaining spots if possible.

Candidates that fit _ A _ _ _ and only use un-tested letters:
- BADLY – uses B, D, L, Y
- CABAL – C, B, L
- MADLY – M, D, L, Y
- VACAY – V, C, Y (but uses Y twice, not ideal)
- HABIT – uses B, I (but I already excluded)
- CADDY – C, D, Y

Among these, BADLY and MADLY both introduce three new consonants plus Y. MADLY feels slightly more common, so I'll go with that.

Current known facts:

1. Pattern: _ A _ _ _
2. Letters used and eliminated:
   Eliminated: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T, M, D
   Confirmed in word: A (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5)
   Therefore word = _ A L _ Y   (positions 3 and 5 already fixed with L and Y)

But wait: the feedback on MADLY was:
M(x) A(✓) D(x) L(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- A is in position 2 (already known from PAINT).
- L is in the word, but was in position 4 in MADLY, so L could be anywhere.
- Y is in the word, but was in position 5 in MADLY, so Y could be anywhere.

So the pattern is not yet _ A L _ Y; instead we only know:
- A is in position 2
- L is in the word (position unknown)
- Y is in the word (position unknown)
- Letters eliminated: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T, M, D

Available letters for positions 1,3,4,5 (excluding the eliminated ones) include:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Uses L and Y somewhere
- Uses only the remaining letters

Possible patterns:
A L Y could be in positions:
- A L _ _ Y
- A _ L _ Y
- A _ _ L Y
- A _ Y _ L (but this seems less likely)
- etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words with A in position 2, using L and Y, and no eliminated letters:

- BALKY (B, A, L, K, Y) – K is allowed
- CALYX (but X is allowed, but CALYX is more obscure)
- BALMY – but M is eliminated
- GALLY – but G is allowed, but ""gally"" is uncommon
- BALKY seems the most common remaining option

Thus BALKY is a valid word that fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to choose a strategic starting word that will give maximum information. Good first guesses typically include common vowels and consonants. Popular choices like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are common, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers all five vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S), giving a broad initial test of the secret word's letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
So I know:
1. The word has an A, but not in the 1st position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded.
3. The remaining letters yet to test include common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc., and the vowels I, U (since E, O are out and A is already found).

I should now pick a word that:
- Contains A in a different position.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Good candidates include:
- TAINT (uses T, N, I)
- PLAIN (uses P, L, N, I)
- CHAIN (uses C, H, N, I)
- PAINT (uses P, N, I, T)

Among these, PAINT covers P, N, I, T plus the known A, giving a broad test of new letters while placing A in position 2.

2. The letters R, O, S, E (from AROSE) and P, I, N, T (from PAINT) are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _

Remaining letters to test should include the consonants and vowels not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to determine:
- What letters are in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- Whether the remaining vowels U or Y (sometimes used as a vowel) are present.

A strategic next guess would:
- Keep A in position 2.
- Introduce several new, common letters, especially those that can appear in clusters (like L, C, K, D, M, B).
- Prefer placing new vowels in remaining spots if possible.

Candidates that fit _ A _ _ _ and only use un-tested letters:
- BADLY – uses B, D, L, Y
- CABAL – C, B, L
- MADLY – M, D, L, Y
- VACAY – V, C, Y (but uses Y twice, not ideal)
- HABIT – uses B, I (but I already excluded)
- CADDY – C, D, Y

Among these, BADLY and MADLY both introduce three new consonants plus Y. MADLY feels slightly more common, so I'll go with that.

Let's update what we know after the four guesses.

1. Pattern so far:  
   Position 2 is A (✓).  
   The word contains Y (✓) – but not necessarily in position 5 (since Y was in position 5 in MADLY and in position 5 in BALKY yet it only got ✓, meaning it is in the word but not necessarily in that exact spot).  
   The word also contains L (✓) – but from BALKY, L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it got -).  
   Letters eliminated so far:  
   R, O, S, E (from AROSE)  
   P, I, N, T (from PAINT)  
   M, D (from MADLY)  
   B, K (from BALKY)  

2. Remaining unused letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
   C, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

3. Current constraints:  
   - The pattern is _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2.  
   - The letters L and Y must appear somewhere in the word, but:  
     – L ≠ position 3  
     – Y ≠ position 5  
   - All other letters must be from the remaining unused set.  

4. Possible positions for L and Y:  
   - L can be in 1, 4, or 5.  
   - Y can be in 1, 3, or 4.  
   - They cannot both be in the same position, so we need to distribute them.  

5. Let's enumerate possible placements:  
   Option 1: L in position 1, Y in position 3 → L A Y _ _  
   Option 2: L in position 1, Y in position 4 → L A _ Y _  
   Option 3: L in position 4, Y in position 1 → Y A _ L _  
   Option 4: L in position 4, Y in position 3 → _ A Y L _  
   Option 5: L in position 5, Y in position 1 → Y A _ _ L  
   Option 6: L in position 5, Y in position 3 → _ A Y _ L  

6. Now, we need to fill in the blanks with remaining unused letters to form valid English 5-letter words.  

   - Option 1: L A Y _ _ → Possible ""LAYUP"" but U and P: P is eliminated. ""LAYIN"" but I is eliminated. ""LAYBY"" but B is eliminated. No valid word.  
   - Option 2: L A _ Y _ → ""LAWNY"" (but W and N: N is eliminated). ""LACY"" but only 4 letters. Seems no valid word.  
   - Option 3: Y A _ L _ → ""YACHT"" but T is eliminated. ""YAWLS"" but S is eliminated. ""YAKEL"" but K is eliminated. No valid word.  
   - Option 4: _ A Y L _ → ""CAYLY"" but Y is repeated and not a word. ""GAYLY"" but G is allowed and Y is already in the word. ""GAYLY"" is a valid word meaning ""cheerfully"".  
   - Option 5: Y A _ _ L → ""YABBL"" but B is eliminated. ""YACAL"" not a word. ""YAHAL"" not a word. ""YAQQL"" not valid.  
   - Option 6: _ A Y _ L → ""CAYUL"" not a word. ""FAYAL"" (a type of tree, but obscure). ""GAYAL"" (a type of cattle, but obscure).  

7. The most plausible valid word from the above is ""GAYLY"" (Option 4).  
   - G, Y, L are all allowed.  
   - A is in position 2.  
   - L is in position 4 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).  
   - Y is in position 3 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).  

Thus, the next guess is GAYLY.

2. Remaining unused letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
   C, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

3. Current constraints:  
   - The pattern is _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2.  
   - The letters L and Y must appear somewhere in the word, but:  
     – L ≠ position 3  
     – Y ≠ position 5  
   - All other letters must be from the remaining unused set.

   Option 5: L in position 5, Y in position 1 → Y A _ _ L  
   Option 6: L in position 5, Y in position 3 → _ A Y _ L  

6. Now, we need to fill in the blanks with remaining unused letters to form valid English 5-letter words.  

   - Option 1: L A Y _ _ → Possible ""LAYUP"" but U and P: P is eliminated. ""LAYIN"" but I is eliminated. ""LAYBY"" but B is eliminated. No valid word.
