### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a strategic 5-letter word that will provide maximum information. The best opening words typically:
1. Contain common letters (especially vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Cover a good distribution of possible letters

Common first-guess strategies favor words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong opener with three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Current facts:

1. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - R – locked in the 3rd position (R ✓ from TIRED, 3rd slot)

2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - A, O, S, T, I, D

3. Letters still “in word but wrong position”:
   - E – must appear somewhere else (since it was “-” in both guesses, but we know it is in the word)

4. Possible remaining letters:
   Common unused so far: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

5. Word pattern so far:
   _ _ R _ _

6. Constraints on E:
   - Cannot be in 1st or 5th position (it was in 1st in AROSE and 4th in TIRED; both showed “-”).
   - Therefore E must be in 2nd or 4th slot.

Remaining possible letters (from unused common letters): B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, V, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with two different letters from the allowed set. Common combinations to try:
- Position 1: L, B, F, C
- Position 4: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ E R _ Y, common English words fitting this include:
- FERRY (but we know K is out, but double R would be redundant)
- BERRY (but B and Y are allowed - but we have Y at 5)
- MERCY (but C and M are allowed)
- HERRY (not a common word)
- GERRY (proper noun)

Looking at the most common possibilities, ""MERRY"" would fit but has double R, which might not be the case. ""HERBY"" would use H and B, but ""HERBY"" is uncommon. ""FERNY"" uses F and N - both allowed.

Let's try ""FERNY"" as it uses F and N which haven't been used yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. I need to choose a strategic 5-letter word that will provide maximum information. The best opening words typically:
1. Contain common letters (especially vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Cover a good distribution of possible letters

Common first-guess strategies favor words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong opener with three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Letters not in the word: A, O, S  
Letters in the word (position unknown): R, E

For the next guess I want to:
1. Keep R and E in new positions (R not in 2nd, E not in 5th).
2. Introduce new common letters while avoiding A, O, S.
3. Potential good new letters: I, T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""TIRED"":
- T, I, D are new letters.
- R and E are re-used in new positions.
- R is now 3rd, E is now 2nd – satisfying the positional constraints.
- Simple, common word structure.

Other options like ""MERIT"", ""PERIL"", ""NERVE"" would also work, but ""TIRED"" seems solid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:

1. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - R – locked in the 3rd position (R ✓ from TIRED, 3rd slot)

2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - A, O, S, T, I, D

3. Letters still “in word but wrong position”:
   - E – must appear somewhere else (since it was “-” in both guesses, but we know it is in the word)

4. Possible remaining letters:
   Common unused so far: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

5. Word pattern so far:
   _ _ R _ _

6. Constraints on E:
   - Cannot be in 1st or 5th position (it was in 1st in AROSE and 4th in TIRED; both showed “-”).
   - Therefore E must be in 2nd or 4th slot.

Let’s test two easy patterns:

Pattern 1: E in 2nd slot →  _ E R _ _
Pattern 2: E in 4th slot →  _ _ R E _

We need to fill the remaining blanks using only allowed letters.  
We might as well guess one of them directly.  
A common word matching Pattern 1 is “FERNS”.  
- Uses new letters F, N, S.
- But S was already excluded in Guess 1, so S(x) – invalid.

Another good candidate matching Pattern 1: “PERKY”  
- Uses P, K, Y – all new and allowed.
- P E R K Y → fits _ E R _ _

Let’s try that.

(If it fails, we can fall back to Pattern 2 next.)
