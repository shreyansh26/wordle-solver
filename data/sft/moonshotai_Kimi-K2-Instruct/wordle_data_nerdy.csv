For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
3. Contains vowels and consonants to test both types
4. Is statistically likely to share letters with many possible words

One of the most effective starting words is ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- It has no repeating letters
- It appears frequently in English words

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
C, A, U, D (because they got an “x” or never appeared again)

Letters that ARE definitely in the word:
R, N, E (each showed up at least once with “-” in every position we tried, so they must be somewhere)

Positions ruled out so far:
R: cannot be 2nd or 5th
N: cannot be 4th or 2nd
E: cannot be 5th or 4th

We still need a 5-letter word that contains the letters R, N, E exactly once each and none of C, A, U, D.

A good next word should:
1. keep R, N, E in brand-new positions
2. introduce two fresh, common letters
3. satisfy the positional constraints above

Candidate: “RENEW”
- Contains R, E, N, and two new letters (W) – but “RENEW” repeats E, which is allowed only if E appears twice in the secret word, but we have no evidence of that. So skip.

Candidate: “NERVE”
- Uses N, E, R plus two new letters (V, E) – again repeats E, same issue.

Candidate: “WRENT”
- Uses W, R, E, N, T – but “T” is uncommon and “WRENT” is not a valid Wordle word list entry.

Candidate: “FERNY”
- Uses F, E, R, N, Y – all distinct except E. Still only one E.

Actually, let’s pick a word that uses each of R, N, E exactly once and two new common letters.

Candidate: “FRENZ” – “Z” is rare.

Candidate: “TREND” – uses D which we know is out.

Candidate: “INERT” – uses I, N, E, R, T – but “I” is new and T is okay.
Check positions:
I N E R T
- N is in position 2 (not yet ruled out for N)
- E is in position 3 (not yet ruled out for E)
- R is in position 4 (not yet ruled out for R)
- Letters are I, N, E, R, T – none of the forbidden letters C, A, U, D appear
- All letters distinct except N, E, R only once each – good

So “INERT” is a valid, information-rich next guess.

Summary of what we know after three guesses:

Letters that are definitely in the word (somewhere): R, N, E  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: C, A, U, D, I, T  

Positions ruled out so far for each required letter:
R – cannot be 2nd, 5th, or 4th (from CRANE 2, UNDER 5, INERT 4)  
N – cannot be 2nd or 4th (from UNDER 2, CRANE 4)  
E – cannot be 4th or 5th (from UNDER 4, CRANE 5)  

So possible positions remaining:
R: 1st or 3rd  
N: 1st, 3rd, or 5th  
E: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly R, N, E once each  
- Contains none of C, A, U, D, I, T  
- Respects the positional constraints above  
- Introduces two new letters (since we have 3 required and need 5 total)

Common remaining consonants: F, G, H, L, M, P, S, Y  
Common remaining vowels: O (only other vowel left)  

Let’s form a candidate that satisfies everything.

Candidate: “NERVE”  
- Has two E’s – we have no evidence of double E, so skip.

Candidate: “ROGER”  
- Uses O and G, but R is repeated – skip.

Candidate: “FERNY”  
- Uses F, Y. Check positions:  
  F(1) E(2) R(3) N(4) Y(5)  
  – N would be 4th; we ruled out N at 4th? No, only ruled out N at 2nd and 4th from CRANE and UNDER, but INERT has N at 2nd which is already ruled out. Wait, no, INERT had N at 2nd? Actually INERT had I(1) N(2) E(3) R(4) T(5). So N at 2nd is now also ruled out. So N can be 1st, 3rd, or 5th. Therefore N at 4th is NOT ruled out yet.  
  – E at 2nd is allowed (only ruled out 4th and 5th)  
  – R at 3rd is allowed (only ruled out 2nd, 5th, 4th)  
  – Word uses F, E, R, N, Y – none of forbidden letters  
  – All distinct letters, one of each R, N, E

So “FERNY” is valid.

Another quick check: “PERKY” – uses P, K, Y.  
Positions: P(1) E(2) R(3) K(4) Y(5).  
N is missing – no good.

“HERON” – uses H, O.  
Positions: H(1) E(2) R(3) O(4) N(5).  
Check constraints:  
- N at 5th is allowed  
- E at 2nd is allowed  
- R at 3rd is allowed  
- Letters: H, E, R, O, N – none of forbidden letters  
- Contains required R, N, E

“HERON” is also valid and uses common letters.

Between “FERNY” and “HERON”, “HERON” is more common and uses O, which we haven’t tested yet. Let’s go with “HERON”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,nerdy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
3. Contains vowels and consonants to test both types
4. Is statistically likely to share letters with many possible words

One of the most effective starting words is ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- It has no repeating letters
- It appears frequently in English words

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the word must contain R, N, E, but not C or A.
Positions to keep in mind:
- R cannot be 2nd letter
- N cannot be 4th letter
- E cannot be 5th letter

Good next-guess criteria:
- Include R, N, E in new slots
- avoid C and A
- use common remaining consonants and vowels
- avoid repeating any letter we already know isn’t in the word

A word that fits: “UNDER”
- U and D are new letters
- R, N, E are present in different positions
- No C or A

<guess>UNDER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(-) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
C, A, U, D (because they got an “x” or never appeared again)

Letters that ARE definitely in the word:
R, N, E (each showed up at least once with “-” in every position we tried, so they must be somewhere)

Positions ruled out so far:
R: cannot be 2nd or 5th
N: cannot be 4th or 2nd
E: cannot be 5th or 4th

We still need a 5-letter word that contains the letters R, N, E exactly once each and none of C, A, U, D.

A good next word should:
1. keep R, N, E in brand-new positions
2. introduce two fresh, common letters
3. satisfy the positional constraints above

Candidate: “RENEW”
- Contains R, E, N, and two new letters (W) – but “RENEW” repeats E, which is allowed only if E appears twice in the secret word, but we have no evidence of that. So skip.

Candidate: “NERVE”
- Uses N, E, R plus two new letters (V, E) – again repeats E, same issue.

Candidate: “WRENT”
- Uses W, R, E, N, T – but “T” is uncommon and “WRENT” is not a valid Wordle word list entry.

Candidate: “FERNY”
- Uses F, E, R, N, Y – all distinct except E. Still only one E.

Actually, let’s pick a word that uses each of R, N, E exactly once and two new common letters.

Candidate: “FRENZ” – “Z” is rare.

Candidate: “TREND” – uses D which we know is out.

Candidate: “INERT” – uses I, N, E, R, T – but “I” is new and T is okay.
Check positions:
I N E R T
- N is in position 2 (not yet ruled out for N)
- E is in position 3 (not yet ruled out for E)
- R is in position 4 (not yet ruled out for R)
- Letters are I, N, E, R, T – none of the forbidden letters C, A, U, D appear
- All letters distinct except N, E, R only once each – good

So “INERT” is a valid, information-rich next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,nerdy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
3. Contains vowels and consonants to test both types
4. Is statistically likely to share letters with many possible words

One of the most effective starting words is ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- It has no repeating letters
- It appears frequently in English words

This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the word must contain R, N, E, but not C or A.
Positions to keep in mind:
- R cannot be 2nd letter
- N cannot be 4th letter
- E cannot be 5th letter

Good next-guess criteria:
- Include R, N, E in new slots
- avoid C and A
- use common remaining consonants and vowels
- avoid repeating any letter we already know isn’t in the word

A word that fits: “UNDER”
- U and D are new letters
- R, N, E are present in different positions
- No C or A

<guess>UNDER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(-) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
C, A, U, D (because they got an “x” or never appeared again)

Letters that ARE definitely in the word:
R, N, E (each showed up at least once with “-” in every position we tried, so they must be somewhere)

Positions ruled out so far:
R: cannot be 2nd or 5th
N: cannot be 4th or 2nd
E: cannot be 5th or 4th

We still need a 5-letter word that contains the letters R, N, E exactly once each and none of C, A, U, D.

A good next word should:
1. keep R, N, E in brand-new positions
2. introduce two fresh, common letters
3. satisfy the positional constraints above

Candidate: “RENEW”
- Contains R, E, N, and two new letters (W) – but “RENEW” repeats E, which is allowed only if E appears twice in the secret word, but we have no evidence of that. So skip.

Candidate: “NERVE”
- Uses N, E, R plus two new letters (V, E) – again repeats E, same issue.

Candidate: “WRENT”
- Uses W, R, E, N, T – but “T” is uncommon and “WRENT” is not a valid Wordle word list entry.

Candidate: “FERNY”
- Uses F, E, R, N, Y – all distinct except E. Still only one E.

Actually, let’s pick a word that uses each of R, N, E exactly once and two new common letters.

Candidate: “FRENZ” – “Z” is rare.

Candidate: “TREND” – uses D which we know is out.

Candidate: “INERT” – uses I, N, E, R, T – but “I” is new and T is okay.
Check positions:
I N E R T
- N is in position 2 (not yet ruled out for N)
- E is in position 3 (not yet ruled out for E)
- R is in position 4 (not yet ruled out for R)
- Letters are I, N, E, R, T – none of the forbidden letters C, A, U, D appear
- All letters distinct except N, E, R only once each – good

So “INERT” is a valid, information-rich next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(-) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after three guesses:

Letters that are definitely in the word (somewhere): R, N, E  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: C, A, U, D, I, T  

Positions ruled out so far for each required letter:
R – cannot be 2nd, 5th, or 4th (from CRANE 2, UNDER 5, INERT 4)  
N – cannot be 2nd or 4th (from UNDER 2, CRANE 4)  
E – cannot be 4th or 5th (from UNDER 4, CRANE 5)  

So possible positions remaining:
R: 1st or 3rd  
N: 1st, 3rd, or 5th  
E: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly R, N, E once each  
- Contains none of C, A, U, D, I, T  
- Respects the positional constraints above  
- Introduces two new letters (since we have 3 required and need 5 total)

Common remaining consonants: F, G, H, L, M, P, S, Y  
Common remaining vowels: O (only other vowel left)  

Let’s form a candidate that satisfies everything.

Candidate: “NERVE”  
- Has two E’s – we have no evidence of double E, so skip.

Candidate: “ROGER”  
- Uses O and G, but R is repeated – skip.

Candidate: “FERNY”  
- Uses F, Y. Check positions:  
  F(1) E(2) R(3) N(4) Y(5)  
  – N would be 4th; we ruled out N at 4th? No, only ruled out N at 2nd and 4th from CRANE and UNDER, but INERT has N at 2nd which is already ruled out. Wait, no, INERT had N at 2nd? Actually INERT had I(1) N(2) E(3) R(4) T(5). So N at 2nd is now also ruled out. So N can be 1st, 3rd, or 5th. Therefore N at 4th is NOT ruled out yet.  
  – E at 2nd is allowed (only ruled out 4th and 5th)  
  – R at 3rd is allowed (only ruled out 2nd, 5th, 4th)  
  – Word uses F, E, R, N, Y – none of forbidden letters  
  – All distinct letters, one of each R, N, E

So “FERNY” is valid.

Another quick check: “PERKY” – uses P, K, Y.  
Positions: P(1) E(2) R(3) K(4) Y(5).  
N is missing – no good.

“HERON” – uses H, O.  
Positions: H(1) E(2) R(3) O(4) N(5).  
Check constraints:  
- N at 5th is allowed  
- E at 2nd is allowed  
- R at 3rd is allowed  
- Letters: H, E, R, O, N – none of forbidden letters  
- Contains required R, N, E

“HERON” is also valid and uses common letters.

Between “FERNY” and “HERON”, “HERON” is more common and uses O, which we haven’t tested yet. Let’s go with “HERON”.

We also still need one more letter (since we only have E, R, N accounted for).

Candidate words:

- N E R D Y – D is eliminated
- N E R D S – D is eliminated
- N E R F S – F is new, S is new

From the latest feedback:

- E in slot 2 is locked (✓)  
- R in slot 3 is locked (✓)  
- N is in the word but not in slot 4 (-)  
- F and S are not in the word (x)  

Current pattern: _ E R _ _ with N still to place.

Positions already tried for N:
- slot 2 (UNDER) – invalid  
- slot 4 (HERON) – invalid  
- slot 4 again (FERNS) – invalid  

So N must now occupy slot 1 or slot 5.

Letters already eliminated:
C, A, U, D, I, T, H, O, F, S

Remaining plausible consonants: B, G, L, M, P, V, W, Y

We need one unused letter for slot 5 (if N is 1) or slot 1 (if N is 5).

Two patterns to test:

1) N E R _ _
   Slot 4 must be a new consonant (B, G, L, M, P, V, W, Y).
   Candidate: N E R V Y → “NERVY”

2) _ E R _ N
   Slot 1 must be a new consonant (but not F, S, etc.).
   Candidate: B E R G N → “BERGN” (not a valid word)

The only common word of these is “NERVY”.

Check constraints:
- N(1) E(2) R(3) V(4) Y(5)  
- Contains N in 1st (never tried), E in 2nd (✓), R in 3rd (✓)  
- Uses V and Y which are still allowed  
- No eliminated letters present  
- All letters distinct

Thus “NERVY” is the logical next guess.
