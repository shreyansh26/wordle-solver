For my first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N etc. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, E)
- 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
- No repeating letters
- Covers different positions for these common letters

This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From both guesses:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O  
- Letters confirmed IN the word:  
  E (and it is correctly placed in position 2)  
  R (somewhere, but not position 1)  
  N (somewhere, but not position 5)

Known pattern so far: _ E _ _ _  
Known letters still to place: R and N (plus 3 other unknown letters)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Contains both R and N somewhere among positions 1,3,4,5 (but not R in 1 and N in 5)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,C,O)

Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (E already used)

Possible candidates:  
- ""D R E N ?"" – no, E must be second.  
- ""P E N D ?"" – lacks R.  
- ""G R E N D"" – 6 letters.  
- ""G R E E N"" – but E already fixed in position 2 and another E would be a repeat.

A valid one: ""P E R N ?"" – but need 5 letters.  
Best fit: ""P E R N D"" – not a word.

Word that fits: ""NERDY"" – but N is first and E is second; N not yet ruled out for first, so try ""NERDY""?  
Actually N is allowed in position 1 because feedback only said N is not in position 5.

However ""NERDY"" has N first, E second, R third – all currently allowed positions.

Another candidate: ""HERON"" – H, E, R, O, N – but O is ruled out.

Valid candidate with no ruled-out letters: ""RENEW"" – but repeats E and has E in position 2 (✓), R first (R can't be first, per feedback).

Correct candidate: ""NERVE""  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (✓)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- V new  
- E again – acceptable repeat of known letter.

But better to avoid duplicate E. Another candidate: ""MERGE""  
- M in 1  
- E in 2 (✓)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- G new  
- E again – same issue.

Better: ""VERNE"" – but E at 5 is invalid (we know E is not at 5 from guess 1).
