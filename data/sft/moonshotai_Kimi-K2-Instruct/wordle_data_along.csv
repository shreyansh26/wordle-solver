Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gained. Good starting words often contain common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most statistically effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

Other good alternatives would be ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong choice.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position: A _ _ _ _
- O is in the correct third position: A _ O _ _
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the third position
3. Does not contain R, S, E

Let's think of possible combinations:
- Second letter: since we haven't tested consonants here yet, try common ones like N, T, L, etc.
- Fourth and fifth letters: we can try common consonants or vowels that haven't been ruled out. We know E is out, but I and U are still possible.

A good candidate is ""ANION"":
- A(✓) in first position
- O(✓) in third position
- Contains N and I which are common and haven't been tested
- Doesn't contain R, S, E

Another could be ""ATOLL"" but double-L might be less likely. ""ANNOY"" is possible but Y is less common. ""AMONG"" is good but G hasn't been tested yet.

I'll go with ANION as it tests new common letters efficiently.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE → A✓ R× O✓ S× E×) we locked-in:
   – A must be the first letter.
   – O must be the third letter.
   – R, S, E definitely do NOT appear anywhere in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (ANION → A✓ N- I× O- N-) we learn:
   – N appears somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (those received “-” meaning “in the word but wrong position”).
   – I is not in the word.
   – Therefore the N must be sitting in the only remaining open spot: position 5 (because positions 2 and 4 were already marked wrong for N).

So we now have the pattern:
A _ O _ N

Letters that cannot appear anywhere: R, S, E, I.

We need a real 5-letter word matching A _ O _ N.

Possible consonants for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Possible consonants/vowels for position 4: A, U (because we already have A and O fixed, and E, I are out).

Scanning common English 5-letter words:
- ABUZZ – contains Z (possible but rare).
- AFOOT – O repeats (but second O would be in position 4, which is acceptable; however T is allowed).
- AGONY – Y is allowed; looks solid.
- ALOON – not a common word.
- AMONG – G is allowed and this is a common word.
- ATONY – T and Y are allowed.

Among these, AMONG is a very common word and fits the confirmed pattern A _ O _ N perfectly.

From the latest feedback (AMONG → A✓ M× O✓ N✓ G✓) we now know:

1. A is locked in position 1
2. O is locked in position 3
3. N is locked in position 4
4. G is locked in position 5
5. M is NOT in the word at all

So the pattern is now: A _ O N G

The only missing letter is the second position. We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with A, followed by some consonant, then O N G.

Possible consonants for position 2 (excluding M, R, S, which we know are out): common ones would be B, C, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Scanning actual English words:
- ABONG – not valid
- ACING – doesn't fit pattern
- ALONG – perfect fit (A-L-O-N-G)
- APING – doesn't fit
- ATONG – not valid

ALONG is a common word that fits the required pattern exactly.
