For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. To maximize information gain, I should pick a word with distinct, common letters. 

Good starting words often include:
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word has:
- _ R _ _ _
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s consider possible words:
- O R _ _ _  (if O is first)
- _ R O _ _  (but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid)
- _ R _ O _  (possible)
- _ R _ _ O  (possible)

We need to pick a word that uses new letters to narrow down possibilities. Common remaining letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, Y, etc.

Let me think of words:
- ORBIT (but B and I are new, T is new) – but O is first, R is second, B, I, T are new.
- FRONT (F, N, T new) – R is second, O is third (invalid, O was in 3 in AROSE, so can’t be here).
- CROWN (C, W, N new) – R is second, O is third (invalid).
- TROOP (T, P new) – R is second, O is first and fourth (but O can’t be in 3, so TR O O P is invalid due to double O and O in 3).
- GROIN (G, I, N new) – R is second, O is third (invalid).

Wait, O cannot be in position 3. So let’s avoid that.

Let’s try where O is in position 4:
- _ R _ O _

Possible words:
- BROKE (B, K new) – but E is excluded.
- PROUD (P, U, D new) – but O is third (invalid).
- CROOK (C, K new) – but O is third and fourth (invalid, O can’t be third).
- GROAN (G, N new) – but A is excluded.
- CROWD (C, W, D new) – O is third (invalid).

Let’s try O in position 1:
- O R _ _ _

Possible words:
- ORBIT (B, I, T new)
- ORDER (E excluded)
- ORGAN (A excluded)
- ORCIN (C, I, N new)
- ORLOP (L, P new)

""ORBIT"" seems good: O is in position 1 (allowed), R in 2, B, I, T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet. This will give us info on B, I, T and confirm O’s position.

Alternative: O in position 5:
- _ R _ _ O

Possible words:
- PRIMO (P, I, M new)
- GRIPO (G, I, P new)
- BRAVO (A, V excluded, A is x)
- CROCO (C new)
- DROOP (D, P new) – but O is third (invalid).

""PRIMO"" seems possible: P, I, M new, R in 2, O in 5.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A not in word.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- O is in word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- S not in word.
- E not in word.

From Guess 2 (ORBIT):
- O is in word but NOT in position 1 (-) (we already knew it wasn’t in 3).
- R is still in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
- B, I, T are not in word.

So the picture is:
- 2nd letter must be R.
- Word contains O but O is NOT in positions 1, 3.
- Letters A, S, E, B, I, T are all excluded.

Therefore O must be in position 4 or 5.

Word skeleton: _ R _ _ _
With O in slot 4 or 5.

Candidate patterns:
Pattern 1: _ R _ O _
Pattern 2: _ R _ _ O

Letters left to use: among the remaining common letters that haven’t been tried and aren’t excluded.

Remaining useful consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining useful vowels: U, Y (since A, E, I, O already handled; O is in word and I is excluded)

We need 3 more letters (positions 1, 3, 5 or 1, 3, 4 depending on O).

Let’s focus on Pattern 1 (_ R _ O _) first.

We want common letters. Good candidates to test are C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P.

Try to pick a word that uses new common letters to narrow possibilities.

One good candidate is “CROWN” – but O is in position 3 (invalid).  
“GROAN” – A is excluded.  
“FROND” – N, D new, but O is in position 4 (fits), R is 2nd.  
“CRONY” – C, N, Y new, O in 4.  
“FRONT” – T excluded.  
“DRONE” – E excluded.  
“GROWN” – G, W, N new, O in 4.  
“PRONG” – P, N, G new, O in 4.

Let’s pick “GROWN”:
- G, W, N are new letters, not yet tested.
- Fits _ R _ O _ (G R O W N).

Another possibility for Pattern 2 (_ R _ _ O):
“GROUP” – P new, O in 5, U is new vowel.
“GROIN” – I excluded.
“GROOM” – O in 5, but double O possible, M new.
“DRONE” – E excluded.

“GROUP” looks decent – G, U, P new, fits _ R _ _ O.

Between “GROWN” and “GROUP”, “GROWN” tests G, W, N and O in position 4, which gives more coverage.

So I will guess GROWN.

<guess>GROWN</guess>",GROWN,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A not in word.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- O is in word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- S not in word.
- E not in word.

From Guess 2 (ORBIT):
- O is in word but NOT in position 1 (-) (we already knew it wasn’t in 3).
- R is still in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
- B, I, T are not in word.

So the picture is:
- 2nd letter must be R.
- Word contains O but O is NOT in positions 1, 3.
- Letters A, S, E, B, I, T are all excluded.

Therefore O must be in position 4 or 5.

Word skeleton: _ R _ _ _
With O in slot 4 or 5.

Candidate patterns:
Pattern 1: _ R _ O _
Pattern 2: _ R _ _ O

Letters left to use: among the remaining common letters that haven’t been tried and aren’t excluded.

Remaining useful consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining useful vowels: U, Y (since A, E, I, O already handled; O is in word and I is excluded)

We need 3 more letters (positions 1, 3, 5 or 1, 3, 4 depending on O).

Let’s focus on Pattern 1 (_ R _ O _) first.

We want common letters. Good candidates to test are C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P.

Try to pick a word that uses new common letters to narrow possibilities.

One good candidate is “CROWN” – but O is in position 3 (invalid).  
“GROAN” – A is excluded.  
“FROND” – N, D new, but O is in position 4 (fits), R is 2nd.  
“CRONY” – C, N, Y new, O in 4.  
“FRONT” – T excluded.  
“DRONE” – E excluded.  
“GROWN” – G, W, N new, O in 4.  
“PRONG” – P, N, G new, O in 4.

Let’s pick “GROWN”:
- G, W, N are new letters, not yet tested.
- Fits _ R _ O _ (G R O W N).

Another possibility for Pattern 2 (_ R _ _ O):
“GROUP” – P new, O in 5, U is new vowel.
“GROIN” – I excluded.
“GROOM” – O in 5, but double O possible, M new.
“DRONE” – E excluded.

“GROUP” looks decent – G, U, P new, fits _ R _ _ O.

Between “GROWN” and “GROUP”, “GROWN” tests G, W, N and O in position 4, which gives more coverage.

So I will guess GROWN.",Guess 3: GROWN -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PRONG,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. To maximize information gain, I should pick a word with distinct, common letters. 

Good starting words often include:
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word has:
- _ R _ _ _
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s consider possible words:
- O R _ _ _  (if O is first)
- _ R O _ _  (but O was in position 3 originally, so this is invalid)
- _ R _ O _  (possible)
- _ R _ _ O  (possible)

We need to pick a word that uses new letters to narrow down possibilities. Common remaining letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, Y, etc.

Let me think of words:
- ORBIT (but B and I are new, T is new) – but O is first, R is second, B, I, T are new.
- FRONT (F, N, T new) – R is second, O is third (invalid, O was in 3 in AROSE, so can’t be here).
- CROWN (C, W, N new) – R is second, O is third (invalid).
- TROOP (T, P new) – R is second, O is first and fourth (but O can’t be in 3, so TR O O P is invalid due to double O and O in 3).
- GROIN (G, I, N new) – R is second, O is third (invalid).

Wait, O cannot be in position 3. So let’s avoid that.

Let’s try where O is in position 4:
- _ R _ O _

Possible words:
- BROKE (B, K new) – but E is excluded.
- PROUD (P, U, D new) – but O is third (invalid).
- CROOK (C, K new) – but O is third and fourth (invalid, O can’t be third).
- GROAN (G, N new) – but A is excluded.
- CROWD (C, W, D new) – O is third (invalid).

Let’s try O in position 1:
- O R _ _ _

Possible words:
- ORBIT (B, I, T new)
- ORDER (E excluded)
- ORGAN (A excluded)
- ORCIN (C, I, N new)
- ORLOP (L, P new)

""ORBIT"" seems good: O is in position 1 (allowed), R in 2, B, I, T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet. This will give us info on B, I, T and confirm O’s position.

Alternative: O in position 5:
- _ R _ _ O

Possible words:
- PRIMO (P, I, M new)
- GRIPO (G, I, P new)
- BRAVO (A, V excluded, A is x)
- CROCO (C new)
- DROOP (D, P new) – but O is third (invalid).

""PRIMO"" seems possible: P, I, M new, R in 2, O in 5.

Between ""ORBIT"" and ""PRIMO"", ""ORBIT"" tests more new letters in the middle positions, so I'll go with that.

“GROAN” – A is excluded.  
“FROND” – N, D new, but O is in position 4 (fits), R is 2nd.  
“CRONY” – C, N, Y new, O in 4.  
“FRONT” – T excluded.  
“DRONE” – E excluded.  
“GROWN” – G, W, N new, O in 4.  
“PRONG” – P, N, G new, O in 4.

Let’s pick “GROWN”:
- G, W, N are new letters, not yet tested.
- Fits _ R _ O _ (G R O W N).

Another possibility for Pattern 2 (_ R _ _ O):
“GROUP” – P new, O in 5, U is new vowel.
“GROIN” – I excluded.
“GROOM” – O in 5, but double O possible, M new.
“DRONE” – E excluded.

“GROUP” looks decent – G, U, P new, fits _ R _ _ O.

Between “GROWN” and “GROUP”, “GROWN” tests G, W, N and O in position 4, which gives more coverage.

So I will guess GROWN.

1. From AROSE:

   - R: correct in position 2.
   - O: in word but NOT in position 3.

2. From ORBIT:
   - B, I, T: not in word.
   - O: still confirmed in word, but NOT in position 1 (adds to our earlier knowledge that it’s also not in 3).

3. From GROWN:
   - G: in word but NOT in position 1.
   - R: still correct in position 2 (expected).
   - O: now placed correctly in position 3 (✓), which overrides the earlier “-” feedback from ORBIT (because the feedback for GROWN says O is correct in position 3).  
     This means earlier “-” was simply telling us position 1 was wrong, but position 3 is now confirmed correct.
   - W: not in word.
   - N: in word but NOT in position 5.

Current confirmed pattern:  
_ R O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, E, B, I, T, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- R (position 2)
- O (position 3)
- G (somewhere among 3,4,5 but 3 is O, so 4 or 5)
- N (somewhere among 1,3,4 but 3 is O, so 1 or 4)

So positions:
1: must be G, N, or another unused letter.
4: must be G, N, or another unused letter.
5: must be G, N, or another unused letter.

Also, we have only used letters: A,R,O,S,E,B,I,T,G,W,N.  
Remaining common letters to try: C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y.

Looking for 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with letters from above.

Candidates:
- FROND – F, D new; but N must be placed. N can go in 1 or 4. FROND has N in 5, but we know N is not in 5 (from GROWN feedback). So invalid.
- CROAK – A excluded.
- PROUD – U, D new; N must fit. PROUD has no N, so invalid (since N is confirmed in word).
- GROIN – I excluded.
- GROPE – P, E excluded.
- CRONE – E excluded.
- PRONG – P new; N in 5 but N can’t be in 5. Invalid.
- DRONE – E excluded.

We need to use the letters G and N in positions 1, 4, or 5, along with one more new letter.

Let’s consider:

Possible words:
- N R O G _ : need a 5th letter not yet used. NROG? is invalid.
- N R O _ G : need a 4th letter. NRO _ G. Try NROCG, NROFG, NROKG, etc. – none are words.

Valid words: CRONG is invalid.
