For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like S, T, R, E, A, I, O, N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: arose  
A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
⇒ R is in position 2 (fixed).  
⇒ A and E are in the word but not in spots 1 & 5 respectively (and also not in 2, since that’s R).  
⇒ O and S are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: reach  
R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)  

Interpreting this new feedback carefully:
- R(-) – This seems contradictory because Guess 1 said R(✓) (correct position).  
  The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbols are always relative to each individual guess.  
  Therefore in “reach”, R appears in position 1, but the secret word has R in position 2, so the feedback for R here is “-” (right letter, wrong position).  
  In other words, R is still confirmed in position 2 overall.

- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 2 (from “reach” feedback).  
  From Guess 1 we also knew E is not in position 5.  
  So E must be in position 1, 3 or 4.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3 (from “reach” feedback).  
  From Guess 1 we knew A is not in position 1.  
  So A must be in position 3, 4 or 5, but not 3 (because of “reach” feedback).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.

- C(x) and H(x) – C and H are not in the word at all.

So far we have:

Position 1: not O, S, C, H  
Position 2: R (fixed)  
Position 3: not E, A, C, H  
Position 4: could be A or E  
Position 5: could be A or E, but E can’t be here (Guess 1 said E is not in position 5)

Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3, and A must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s list consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: A, E, I, U (O is out)

We need a word that:
- has R in position 2  
- uses A and E in legal positions  
- uses only allowed letters elsewhere

Candidate slots:
1: E or another consonant  
2: R  
3: if we put E here, then A must go to 4 or 5  
4: A or consonant  
5: A or consonant, but if A is not here then E must be in 1 or 3 etc.

Possible pattern: _ R _ _ _  

Let’s try a word that places E in position 1 and A in position 4: E R _ A _  
Third and fifth letters must be consonants, not C, H, S, O.  
Good consonants: B, D, L, N, T, etc.

Word that fits: “BREAD”  
Check:  
- B (allowed)  
- R (fixed)  
- E (allowed in position 3)  
- A (allowed in position 4)  
- D (allowed)

But wait: from earlier constraints, A must be in 4 or 5 and E must be in 1 or 3.  
ER_BA fits A in 4 and E in 1, but is that a word? “ER_BA” isn’t valid.  
Let’s instead use A in 5 and E in 3: _ R E _ A  
That gives us “TREND” no, or “GRETA” no.  
Better: “BREAD” has E in 3 and A in 4 and is a valid word. Check constraints:

- B (allowed)  
- R (pos 2 ok)  
- E (pos 3 ok – not excluded)  
- A (pos 4 ok)  
- D (allowed)

Thus “BREAD” satisfies all constraints so far.

  So A must be in position 3, 4 or 5, but not 3 (because of “reach” feedback).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.

- C(x) and H(x) – C and H are not in the word at all.

So far we have:

Position 1: not O, S, C, H  
Position 2: R (fixed)  
Position 3: not E, A, C, H  
Position 4: could be A or E  
Position 5: could be A or E, but E can’t be here (Guess 1 said E is not in position 5)

Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3, and A must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s list consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: A, E, I, U (O is out)

We need a word that:
- has R in position 2  
- uses A and E in legal positions  
- uses only allowed letters elsewhere

Candidate slots:
1: E or another consonant  
2: R  
3: if we put E here, then A must go to 4 or 5  
4: A or consonant  
5: A or consonant, but if A is not here then E must be in 1 or 3 etc.

Possible pattern: _ R _ _ _  

Let’s try a word that places E in position 1 and A in position 4: E R _ A _  
Third and fifth letters must be consonants, not C, H, S, O.  
Good consonants: B, D, L, N, T, etc.

Word that fits: “BREAD”  
Check:  
- B (allowed)  
- R (fixed)  
- E (allowed in position 3)  
- A (allowed in position 4)  
- D (allowed)

But wait: from earlier constraints, A must be in 4 or 5 and E must be in 1 or 3.  
ER_BA fits A in 4 and E in 1, but is that a word? “ER_BA” isn’t valid.  
Let’s instead use A in 5 and E in 3: _ R E _ A  
That gives us “TREND” no, or “GRETA” no.  
Better: “BREAD” has E in 3 and A in 4 and is a valid word. Check constraints:

- B (allowed)  
- R (pos 2 ok)  
- E (pos 3 ok – not excluded)  
- A (pos 4 ok)  
- D (allowed)

Thus “BREAD” satisfies all constraints so far.

This means every letter is in the correct position except B, which is not in the word.  
Hence the secret word is exactly:

_ R E A D   with the first letter still unknown.

Only four letters remain to be tested for position 1, and they must be common consonants that haven’t already been ruled out.

Previous exclusions (across all guesses):  
B, C, H, O, S

Still-allowed consonants for position 1: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

But R, E, A, D are already placed, so we just need the first letter.  
The most common first-letter candidates are F, G, L, M, N, P, T.
