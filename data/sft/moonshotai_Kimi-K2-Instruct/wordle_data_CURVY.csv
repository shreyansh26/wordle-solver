For the first guess, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Some popular choices for first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-): the letter R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A, I, S, E are all marked with (x), so none of those four letters appear anywhere in the word.

So we:
- Must keep R somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Must avoid A, I, S, E entirely.
- Still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates for the next guess should contain R (not first) and use fresh, common letters not yet ruled out. A strong choice is ""ROUND"":

From the two previous guesses we know:

  So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

- U is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  So U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- Letters definitely excluded so far: A, I, S, E, O, N, D.

- contains R (in 3, 4, or 5)  
- contains U (in 1, 2, 4, or 5)

Remaining common consonants to test: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only Y for now (since A, I, E, O are out).

A word that satisfies all this is “TRULY”:
- Letters used: T, R, U, L, Y – none of them have been marked “x”.  
- R is in position 3 (allowed by feedback).  
- U is in position 2 (allowed by feedback).

This maximizes new-letter coverage while respecting all prior constraints.

Summary of what we know after three guesses:

Letters known to be in the word (and last-tested positions that are wrong):
- R – cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 ⇒ must be 4 or 5
- U – cannot be in positions 2 or 3 ⇒ must be 1, 4, or 5
- Y – is in position 5 (✓)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, I, S, E, O, N, D, T, L

Remaining common unused consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining unused vowel: only the “sometimes-vowel” Y (already fixed in 5).

We therefore need a 5-letter word that:
- has Y in position 5
- has R in position 4 or 5 (but 5 is Y) ⇒ R must be in position 4
- has U somewhere in 1 or 4, but 4 is R ⇒ U must be in position 1
- uses only letters not yet ruled out

So the skeleton is:  
U _ _ R Y

We now pick the two middle consonants from the still-available set to make a valid English word.  
The combination B and R is invalid (double R), B and M gives UBMRY (not a word), etc.  
A valid English word that fits the skeleton U _ _ R Y is “CURRY”, but C and U are allowed and R is allowed (already required). However double R is fine and C is still allowed. 

Wait, let me double check the list:  
- C is not yet excluded.  
- R is already placed in 4.  
- U is in 1.  
- Y in 5.  
So CURRY fits: C U R R Y.

All letters used are still allowed by the feedback.

- Y – is in position 5 (✓)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:

Remaining common unused consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining unused vowel: only the “sometimes-vowel” Y (already fixed in 5).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Some popular choices for first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-): the letter R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A, I, S, E are all marked with (x), so none of those four letters appear anywhere in the word.

So we:
- Must keep R somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Must avoid A, I, S, E entirely.
- Still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates for the next guess should contain R (not first) and use fresh, common letters not yet ruled out. A strong choice is ""ROUND"":
- R in position 2 (satisfies the (-) feedback).
- Uses O, U, N, D—none of which have been tested yet and are common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

- R is in the word but **not** in position 1 or 2.  
  So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

- U is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  So U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- Letters definitely excluded so far: A, I, S, E, O, N, D.

With these constraints, we want a legal 5-letter word that  
- contains R (in 3, 4, or 5)  
- contains U (in 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining common consonants to test: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only Y for now (since A, I, E, O are out).

A word that satisfies all this is “TRULY”:
- Letters used: T, R, U, L, Y – none of them have been marked “x”.  
- R is in position 3 (allowed by feedback).  
- U is in position 2 (allowed by feedback).

This maximizes new-letter coverage while respecting all prior constraints.

- Position 2: U(✓)  → U is correct and locked in.

- Position 4: R(-)  → There is an R in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Position 5: Y(✓)  → Y is correct and locked in.

Since we already have C, U, R, Y fixed in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively, the only remaining unknown is position 4.  
The feedback tells us the fourth letter is NOT R (because we got “R(-)” on the second R), so we need a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Letters already excluded so far: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, T, L, plus the duplicate R in position 4 is now excluded.  
Remaining available letters include B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern C U R _ Y and uses one of the still-allowed letters in the blank.  
Scanning the dictionary, valid words are:
- CURFY (uncommon, “curfy” is a Scots word)
- CURDY (from “curd”)
- CURVY
- CURBY (rare)

Among these, “CURVY” is the most common and the most likely answer.

Therefore, the next guess is CURVY.
