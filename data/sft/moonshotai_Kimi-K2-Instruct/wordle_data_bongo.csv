For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. This helps identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. A good starting word often includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a broad coverage of frequently used letters and positions, which should provide meaningful feedback for narrowing down subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE are now ruled out: S, L, A, T, E.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
- Letters we know ARE in the word:
  – O is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2: _ O _ _ _).
  – N is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be in position 4).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _ and must contain N somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Letters still available (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
- Position 2 = O
- Contains N (but N not in position 4)
- Uses only available letters (none from {S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D})

Possible candidates: words like ""CONIC"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"", ""JOKING"", ""GONIF"", etc. but we must use only valid 5-letter English words.

A good candidate that fits: ""MONEY""
- M, O, N, E, Y
- O is in position 2 (correct per feedback)
- N is in position 3 (different from position 4 where it was marked wrong, so valid)
- No letters from the eliminated set {S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D} except E was already eliminated in SLATE → E is out, so MONEY would be invalid because E is used.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This helps identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. A good starting word often includes common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a broad coverage of frequently used letters and positions, which should provide meaningful feedback for narrowing down subsequent guesses.

We need a completely fresh set of letters.  
The remaining consonants that are still quite common include R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K and remaining vowels are I, O, U.  
A popular second-guess choice that avoids every letter we’ve already tried and still packs frequently-seen letters is “ROUND”:

R – common first-letter
O – common vowel
U – second vowel
N – common consonant
D – common consonant
None of R, O, U, N, D were in SLATE, so this satisfies the constraint.

- Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
- Letters we know ARE in the word:
  – O is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2: _ O _ _ _).
  – N is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be in position 4).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _ and must contain N somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

Letters still available (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
- Position 2 = O
- Contains N (but N not in position 4)
- Uses only available letters (none from {S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D})

Possible candidates: words like ""CONIC"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"", ""JOKING"", ""GONIF"", etc. but we must use only valid 5-letter English words.

A good candidate that fits: ""MONEY""
- M, O, N, E, Y
- O is in position 2 (correct per feedback)
- N is in position 3 (different from position 4 where it was marked wrong, so valid)
- No letters from the eliminated set {S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D} except E was already eliminated in SLATE → E is out, so MONEY would be invalid because E is used.

Another candidate: ""HONKY""
H, O, N, K, Y — all letters are still available, and N is in position 3 (not 4), O is in position 2. This is valid.

Another: ""PONCY""
P, O, N, C, Y — also valid.

Among these, ""HONKY"" is a valid English word and gives us info on H, K, Y.

1. Summary of known facts  
   - Position 2 = O (locked).  
   - Position 3 = N (locked).  
   - Pattern so far: _ O N _ _  
   - Letters that are **definitely not** in the word:  
     S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, H, K, Y, I, F  
   - Remaining legal letters: B, C, G (still allowed), J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

2. From feedback on Guess 4 (GONIF)  
   – G appeared with a “-” mark, so **G is in the word but not in position 1**.  
   – The only open positions left are 1 and 4.  
   – Therefore G **must** be in position 4, giving the pattern: _ O N G _  

3. Now we just need a single letter for position 5 from the still-legal set {B, C, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}.  
   We want to pick one that makes a valid English 5-letter word.

4. Scanning possibilities:  
   BONG**O** – but O already fixed in position 2.  
   BONG**A** – A already eliminated.  
   BONG**E** – E already eliminated.  
   BONG**Y** – Y already eliminated.  
   BONG**S** – S already eliminated.  
   BONG**O** again repeats the O issue.  
   Only **BONG** plus a letter that is still legal: B, C, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   The only valid word is **BONG** + **O** but O is already used in position 2 and cannot repeat in the known pattern.  
   Wait, we need a fifth letter that is still legal.  
   Check dictionary for _ONG_ endings:  
   - BONGO – O repeats (invalid).  
   - BONGI – I is eliminated.  
   - BONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - CONGA – A eliminated.  
   - PONGO – O repeats.  
   - VONGI – I eliminated.  
   - MONGO – O repeats.  
   - PONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - JONGK – not a word.  
   - PONGY – same.  
   - ZONGI – I eliminated.  
   - CONGO – O repeats.  
   - BONGS – S eliminated.  
   - CONGA – A eliminated.  
   - BONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - JONGS – S eliminated.  
   - GONGS – G already used in position 4 and S eliminated.  

   It appears the only remaining single-letter options for position 5 that are still legal and produce a valid word are **C** or **P**.  
   Looking again:  
   - BONG**O** – invalid.  
   - **BONG** + **C** gives **BONGC**, which is not a word.  
   - **BONG** + **P** gives **BONGP**, which is not a word.  

   Realization: the pattern is _ O N G _ (positions 1-2-3-4).  
   Therefore the fifth letter is actually position 5, and the word is _ O N G _.  
   We need a single letter for position 1 that, combined with “ONG_”, makes a valid 5-letter English word.  

   Re-examining valid English words ending in “ONG_” (positions 2-3-4-5 being O-N-G-?):  
   – **DONG_** – D eliminated.  
   – **SONG_** – S eliminated.  
   – **LONG_** – L eliminated.  
   – **BONG_** – B is still legal; we can append any legal letter to position 5.  
   – **PONG_** – P is still legal.  

   So possible valid words:  
   - B O N G + (legal fifth letter)  
   - P O N G + (legal fifth letter)  

   Pick legal letters for position 5:  
   - B O N G **O** – O repeats.  
   - B O N G **E** – E eliminated.  
   - B O N G **C** – “Bongc” is not a word.  
   - B O N G **Y** – Y eliminated.  
   - B O N G **S** – S eliminated.  
   - P O N G **O** – O repeats.  
   - P O N G **E** – E eliminated.  
   - P O N G **Y** – Y eliminated.  
   - P O N G **S** – S eliminated.  

   The only remaining legal combination that is a valid English word is **B O N G + O** but O repeats.  
   This suggests the only possible word left is **BONGO**, but the second O repeats position 2.  
   However, the feedback has never ruled out a letter appearing twice; it only tells us about the specific positions.  
   Therefore **BONGO** is a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies every constraint:  
   – Pattern _ O N G O  
   – G is in position 4 (correct per G(-) in Guess 4).  
   – All letters used (B, O, N, G, O) are among the still-legal set.  

   (The two O’s are allowed since the feedback only indicates position-specific information, not letter counts.)

5. Thus, the next logical and only valid guess is BONGO.

   – Therefore G **must** be in position 4, giving the pattern: _ O N G _  

3. Now we just need a single letter for position 5 from the still-legal set {B, C, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}.  
   We want to pick one that makes a valid English 5-letter word.

4. Scanning possibilities:  
   BONG**O** – but O already fixed in position 2.  
   BONG**A** – A already eliminated.  
   BONG**E** – E already eliminated.  
   BONG**Y** – Y already eliminated.  
   BONG**S** – S already eliminated.  
   BONG**O** again repeats the O issue.  
   Only **BONG** plus a letter that is still legal: B, C, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   The only valid word is **BONG** + **O** but O is already used in position 2 and cannot repeat in the known pattern.  
   Wait, we need a fifth letter that is still legal.  
   Check dictionary for _ONG_ endings:  
   - BONGO – O repeats (invalid).  
   - BONGI – I is eliminated.  
   - BONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - CONGA – A eliminated.  
   - PONGO – O repeats.  
   - VONGI – I eliminated.  
   - MONGO – O repeats.  
   - PONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - JONGK – not a word.  
   - PONGY – same.  
   - ZONGI – I eliminated.  
   - CONGO – O repeats.  
   - BONGS – S eliminated.  
   - CONGA – A eliminated.  
   - BONGY – Y eliminated.  
   - JONGS – S eliminated.  
   - GONGS – G already used in position 4 and S eliminated.  

   It appears the only remaining single-letter options for position 5 that are still legal and produce a valid word are **C** or **P**.  
   Looking again:  
   - BONG**O** – invalid.  
   - **BONG** + **C** gives **BONGC**, which is not a word.  
   - **BONG** + **P** gives **BONGP**, which is not a word.  

   Realization: the pattern is _ O N G _ (positions 1-2-3-4).  
   Therefore the fifth letter is actually position 5, and the word is _ O N G _.  
   We need a single letter for position 1 that, combined with “ONG_”, makes a valid 5-letter English word.  

   Re-examining valid English words ending in “ONG_” (positions 2-3-4-5 being O-N-G-?):  
   – **DONG_** – D eliminated.  
   – **SONG_** – S eliminated.  
   – **LONG_** – L eliminated.  
   – **BONG_** – B is still legal; we can append any legal letter to position 5.  
   – **PONG_** – P is still legal.  

   So possible valid words:  
   - B O N G + (legal fifth letter)  
   - P O N G + (legal fifth letter)  

   Pick legal letters for position 5:  
   - B O N G **O** – O repeats.  
   - B O N G **E** – E eliminated.  
   - B O N G **C** – “Bongc” is not a word.  
   - B O N G **Y** – Y eliminated.  
   - B O N G **S** – S eliminated.  
   - P O N G **O** – O repeats.  
   - P O N G **E** – E eliminated.  
   - P O N G **Y** – Y eliminated.  
   - P O N G **S** – S eliminated.  

   The only remaining legal combination that is a valid English word is **B O N G + O** but O repeats.  
   This suggests the only possible word left is **BONGO**, but the second O repeats position 2.  
   However, the feedback has never ruled out a letter appearing twice; it only tells us about the specific positions.  
   Therefore **BONGO** is a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies every constraint:  
   – Pattern _ O N G O  
   – G is in position 4 (correct per G(-) in Guess 4).  
   – All letters used (B, O, N, G, O) are among the still-legal set.  

   (The two O’s are allowed since the feedback only indicates position-specific information, not letter counts.)

5. Thus, the next logical and only valid guess is BONGO.",Guess 5: BONGO -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
