For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (very common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback we receive.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is correct in position 2 (second letter)  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position  
- S and A are not in the word  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Contains O and E, but neither is in their original spot (O not 3rd, E not 5th)  
- Does not contain A or S  

Next step: find a word that:
- Starts with any letter except A or S  
- Has R in the second spot  
- Has O somewhere other than the third spot  
- Has E somewhere other than the fifth spot  

A good candidate is ""BROKE"":
- B: new consonant, could be in 1st spot  
- R: already confirmed in 2nd spot  
- O: moves from 3rd to 2nd spot (but 2nd is already R, so invalid) – wait, O must move to 1st, 4th, or 5th spot  
- K: new consonant  
- E: must move from 5th to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th spot

   - R is confirmed again at position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).

So far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we know are present: O, E (positions unknown, but O ≠ 3 and E ≠ 5)
- Letters we know are absent: A, S, P, V

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains O and E, with O not in position 3 and E not in position 5
- Does not contain A, S, P, V

Possible positions for O and E:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4
- But position 2 is R, so E cannot be in 2.

Let's try to place O and E:
Option 1: O in 1, E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ or O R _ E _

Option 2: O in 4, E in 1 or 3
   - _ R O E _ or E R O _ _

Option 3: O in 5, E in 1, 3, or 4
   - _ R _ E O or _ R E _ O or E R _ _ O

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints. A good candidate is ""GROPE"":

   - _ R O E _ → ""TROVE"" (V excluded), ""DROVE"" (V excluded), ""BROKE"" (O in 3)

   - _ R E _ O → ""CREDO"", ""GRECO"" (not common)
   - _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""PRIMO"" (P excluded)

Let me list valid words:
- O R E _ _ → ""ORIEL"" (valid word)
   - O, R, E, I, L
   - Check constraints: R in 2 (ok), O not in 3 (ok, it's in 1), E not in 5 (ok, it's in 3), no A,S,P,V
   - This seems valid.

- _ R O E _ → ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3), ""CRORE"" (invalid E in 5)
   - ""CRORE"" is invalid because E is in 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (very common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback we receive.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is correct in position 2 (second letter)  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position  
- S and A are not in the word  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Contains O and E, but neither is in their original spot (O not 3rd, E not 5th)  
- Does not contain A or S  

Next step: find a word that:
- Starts with any letter except A or S  
- Has R in the second spot  
- Has O somewhere other than the third spot  
- Has E somewhere other than the fifth spot  

A good candidate is ""BROKE"":
- B: new consonant, could be in 1st spot  
- R: already confirmed in 2nd spot  
- O: moves from 3rd to 2nd spot (but 2nd is already R, so invalid) – wait, O must move to 1st, 4th, or 5th spot  
- K: new consonant  
- E: must move from 5th to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th spot  

Alternative: ""PROVE"":
- P: new consonant  
- R: confirmed in 2nd spot  
- O: moves from 3rd to 4th spot  
- V: new consonant  
- E: moves from 5th to 3rd spot  

This seems valid. Let’s try ""PROVE"".

<guess>PROVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PROVE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
   - R is locked in at position 2.
   - O is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and S are not in the word.

2. PROVE → P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
   - P and V are not in the word.
   - R is confirmed again at position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before).

So far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we know are present: O, E (positions unknown, but O ≠ 3 and E ≠ 5)
- Letters we know are absent: A, S, P, V

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains O and E, with O not in position 3 and E not in position 5
- Does not contain A, S, P, V

Possible positions for O and E:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4
- But position 2 is R, so E cannot be in 2.

Let's try to place O and E:
Option 1: O in 1, E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ or O R _ E _

Option 2: O in 4, E in 1 or 3
   - _ R O E _ or E R O _ _

Option 3: O in 5, E in 1, 3, or 4
   - _ R _ E O or _ R E _ O or E R _ _ O

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints. A good candidate is ""GROPE"":
- G: new letter, not excluded
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3, but O cannot be in 3 → invalid

Next candidate: ""CRORE"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GRIOT"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- I: new letter
- O: would be in 4 → valid
- T: new letter
But does it contain E? No → invalid.

Next: ""CROME"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROKE"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""TROPE"":
- T: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROOM"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""DROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""BROKE"":
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""FRORE"":
- F: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROPE"" was invalid due to O in 3.

Let me think differently: possible valid placements:
O in 1: O R _ _ _ → need E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ → ""OREAD"" (has A), ""ORECT"" (not a word)
   - O R _ E _ → ""ORIEL"", ""ORGUE"" (not common), ""ORATE"" (has A)
O in 4: _ R O E _ → ""CRORE"" (E in 5 is invalid), ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3)
   - _ R O E _ → ""TROVE"" (V excluded), ""DROVE"" (V excluded), ""BROKE"" (O in 3)
   - Actually: ""BROKE"" has O in 3 → invalid
O in 5: _ R _ _ O → need E in 1, 3, or 4
   - E R _ _ O → ""ERUGO"" (not a word), ""ERUGO"" (not valid)
   - _ R E _ O → ""CREDO"", ""GRECO"" (not common)
   - _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""PRIMO"" (P excluded)

Let me list valid words:
- O R E _ _ → ""ORIEL"" (valid word)
   - O, R, E, I, L
   - Check constraints: R in 2 (ok), O not in 3 (ok, it's in 1), E not in 5 (ok, it's in 3), no A,S,P,V
   - This seems valid.

- _ R O E _ → ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3), ""CRORE"" (invalid E in 5)
   - ""CRORE"" is invalid because E is in 5.

- _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""BRICO"" (not a word)

""ORIEL"" seems to be the best fit so far. Let me check:
Word: O R I E L
Positions:
1: O
2: R
3: I
4: E
5: L
Checks:
- R is in position 2: ok
- O is in word: yes, position 1 (not 3): ok
- E is in word: yes, position 4 (not 5): ok
- No A, S, P, V: ok

Therefore, ""ORIEL"" is a valid next guess.

From the three guesses we have:

1. A R O S E

   – E is in word but not in spot 5  
   – A, S are out  

2. P R O V E

3. O R I E L  
   – O is in word but not in spot 1 (clue: O(-))  
   – I is out  
   – E is in word but not in spot 4 (clue: E(-))  

So the current constraints are:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters that must appear: O and E  
  – O must be in spot 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 2[R])  
  – E must be in spot 1 or 3 (cannot be 2[R], 4, 5)  

Letters still allowed: all others except A S P V I

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: O is in 4  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ O _   (but E cannot be in 1 either because spot 1 is allowed; check)  
_ R E O _   (E in 3, O in 4)

Case 2: O is in 5  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ _ O   (E in 1)  
_ R E _ O   (E in 3)

We need actual words fitting these patterns.

Looking at _ R E O _ (E in 3, O in 4):
Searching common five-letter words yields “BREED”, but it has two E’s and the feedback so far only guarantees one E. Not ideal.

Next, _ R _ E O (E in 4, O in 5) is ruled out because E cannot be in 4.

Next, E R _ O _ (E in 1, O in 4):
Looking for words: “ERUGO” (invalid), “ERGOT” – but T is still allowed – gives “ERGOT”. Check constraints:
- E in 1, R in 2, G in 3, O in 4, T in 5
- Letters used: E, R, G, O, T – all allowed (no A, S, P, V, I)
- O is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters.

   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before).

So far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we know are present: O, E (positions unknown, but O ≠ 3 and E ≠ 5)
- Letters we know are absent: A, S, P, V

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains O and E, with O not in position 3 and E not in position 5
- Does not contain A, S, P, V

Possible positions for O and E:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4
- But position 2 is R, so E cannot be in 2.

Let's try to place O and E:
Option 1: O in 1, E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ or O R _ E _

Option 2: O in 4, E in 1 or 3
   - _ R O E _ or E R O _ _

Option 3: O in 5, E in 1, 3, or 4
   - _ R _ E O or _ R E _ O or E R _ _ O

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints. A good candidate is ""GROPE"":
- G: new letter, not excluded
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3, but O cannot be in 3 → invalid

Next candidate: ""CRORE"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GRIOT"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- I: new letter
- O: would be in 4 → valid
- T: new letter
But does it contain E? No → invalid.

Next: ""CROME"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROKE"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""TROPE"":
- T: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROOM"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""DROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""BROKE"":
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""FRORE"":
- F: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROPE"" was invalid due to O in 3.

Let me think differently: possible valid placements:
O in 1: O R _ _ _ → need E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ → ""OREAD"" (has A), ""ORECT"" (not a word)
   - O R _ E _ → ""ORIEL"", ""ORGUE"" (not common), ""ORATE"" (has A)
O in 4: _ R O E _ → ""CRORE"" (E in 5 is invalid), ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3)
   - _ R O E _ → ""TROVE"" (V excluded), ""DROVE"" (V excluded), ""BROKE"" (O in 3)
   - Actually: ""BROKE"" has O in 3 → invalid
O in 5: _ R _ _ O → need E in 1, 3, or 4
   - E R _ _ O → ""ERUGO"" (not a word), ""ERUGO"" (not valid)
   - _ R E _ O → ""CREDO"", ""GRECO"" (not common)
   - _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""PRIMO"" (P excluded)

Let me list valid words:
- O R E _ _ → ""ORIEL"" (valid word)
   - O, R, E, I, L
   - Check constraints: R in 2 (ok), O not in 3 (ok, it's in 1), E not in 5 (ok, it's in 3), no A,S,P,V
   - This seems valid.

- _ R O E _ → ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3), ""CRORE"" (invalid E in 5)
   - ""CRORE"" is invalid because E is in 5.

- _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""BRICO"" (not a word)

""ORIEL"" seems to be the best fit so far. Let me check:
Word: O R I E L
Positions:
1: O
2: R
3: I
4: E
5: L
Checks:
- R is in position 2: ok
- O is in word: yes, position 1 (not 3): ok
- E is in word: yes, position 4 (not 5): ok
- No A, S, P, V: ok

Therefore, ""ORIEL"" is a valid next guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PROVE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
Guess 3: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

1. A R O S E  
   – R is in spot 2 (locked)  
   – O is in word but not in spot 3  
   – E is in word but not in spot 5  
   – A, S are out  

2. P R O V E  
   – P, V are out (same R, O, E clues as above)  

3. O R I E L  
   – O is in word but not in spot 1 (clue: O(-))  
   – I is out  
   – E is in word but not in spot 4 (clue: E(-))  

So the current constraints are:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters that must appear: O and E  
  – O must be in spot 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 2[R])  
  – E must be in spot 1 or 3 (cannot be 2[R], 4, 5)  

Letters still allowed: all others except A S P V I

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: O is in 4  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ O _   (but E cannot be in 1 either because spot 1 is allowed; check)  
_ R E O _   (E in 3, O in 4)

Case 2: O is in 5  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ _ O   (E in 1)  
_ R E _ O   (E in 3)

We need actual words fitting these patterns.

Looking at _ R E O _ (E in 3, O in 4):
Searching common five-letter words yields “BREED”, but it has two E’s and the feedback so far only guarantees one E. Not ideal.

Next, _ R _ E O (E in 4, O in 5) is ruled out because E cannot be in 4.

Next, E R _ O _ (E in 1, O in 4):
Looking for words: “ERUGO” (invalid), “ERGOT” – but T is still allowed – gives “ERGOT”. Check constraints:
- E in 1, R in 2, G in 3, O in 4, T in 5
- Letters used: E, R, G, O, T – all allowed (no A, S, P, V, I)
- O is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters.

“ERGOT” satisfies every constraint.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (very common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback we receive.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is correct in position 2 (second letter)  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position  
- S and A are not in the word  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Contains O and E, but neither is in their original spot (O not 3rd, E not 5th)  
- Does not contain A or S  

Next step: find a word that:
- Starts with any letter except A or S  
- Has R in the second spot  
- Has O somewhere other than the third spot  
- Has E somewhere other than the fifth spot  

A good candidate is ""BROKE"":
- B: new consonant, could be in 1st spot  
- R: already confirmed in 2nd spot  
- O: moves from 3rd to 2nd spot (but 2nd is already R, so invalid) – wait, O must move to 1st, 4th, or 5th spot  
- K: new consonant  
- E: must move from 5th to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th spot  

Alternative: ""PROVE"":
- P: new consonant  
- R: confirmed in 2nd spot  
- O: moves from 3rd to 4th spot  
- V: new consonant  
- E: moves from 5th to 3rd spot  

This seems valid. Let’s try ""PROVE"".

<guess>PROVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PROVE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
   - R is locked in at position 2.
   - O is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and S are not in the word.

2. PROVE → P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
   - P and V are not in the word.
   - R is confirmed again at position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (same as before).

So far:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters we know are present: O, E (positions unknown, but O ≠ 3 and E ≠ 5)
- Letters we know are absent: A, S, P, V

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Contains O and E, with O not in position 3 and E not in position 5
- Does not contain A, S, P, V

Possible positions for O and E:
- O can be in positions 1, 4, 5
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4
- But position 2 is R, so E cannot be in 2.

Let's try to place O and E:
Option 1: O in 1, E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ or O R _ E _

Option 2: O in 4, E in 1 or 3
   - _ R O E _ or E R O _ _

Option 3: O in 5, E in 1, 3, or 4
   - _ R _ E O or _ R E _ O or E R _ _ O

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints. A good candidate is ""GROPE"":
- G: new letter, not excluded
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3, but O cannot be in 3 → invalid

Next candidate: ""CRORE"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GRIOT"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- I: new letter
- O: would be in 4 → valid
- T: new letter
But does it contain E? No → invalid.

Next: ""CROME"":
- C: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROKE"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""TROPE"":
- T: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROOM"":
- G: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""DROVE"": V is excluded.

Next: ""BROKE"":
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""FRORE"":
- F: new letter
- R: correct position
- O: would be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GROPE"" was invalid due to O in 3.

Let me think differently: possible valid placements:
O in 1: O R _ _ _ → need E in 3 or 4
   - O R E _ _ → ""OREAD"" (has A), ""ORECT"" (not a word)
   - O R _ E _ → ""ORIEL"", ""ORGUE"" (not common), ""ORATE"" (has A)
O in 4: _ R O E _ → ""CRORE"" (E in 5 is invalid), ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3)
   - _ R O E _ → ""TROVE"" (V excluded), ""DROVE"" (V excluded), ""BROKE"" (O in 3)
   - Actually: ""BROKE"" has O in 3 → invalid
O in 5: _ R _ _ O → need E in 1, 3, or 4
   - E R _ _ O → ""ERUGO"" (not a word), ""ERUGO"" (not valid)
   - _ R E _ O → ""CREDO"", ""GRECO"" (not common)
   - _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""PRIMO"" (P excluded)

Let me list valid words:
- O R E _ _ → ""ORIEL"" (valid word)
   - O, R, E, I, L
   - Check constraints: R in 2 (ok), O not in 3 (ok, it's in 1), E not in 5 (ok, it's in 3), no A,S,P,V
   - This seems valid.

- _ R O E _ → ""GROPE"" (invalid O in 3), ""CRORE"" (invalid E in 5)
   - ""CRORE"" is invalid because E is in 5.

- _ R _ E O → ""TRIBO"" (not a word), ""BRICO"" (not a word)

""ORIEL"" seems to be the best fit so far. Let me check:
Word: O R I E L
Positions:
1: O
2: R
3: I
4: E
5: L
Checks:
- R is in position 2: ok
- O is in word: yes, position 1 (not 3): ok
- E is in word: yes, position 4 (not 5): ok
- No A, S, P, V: ok

Therefore, ""ORIEL"" is a valid next guess.

<guess>ORIEL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PROVE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(-) V(x) E(-)
Guess 3: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

1. A R O S E  
   – R is in spot 2 (locked)  
   – O is in word but not in spot 3  
   – E is in word but not in spot 5  
   – A, S are out  

2. P R O V E  
   – P, V are out (same R, O, E clues as above)  

3. O R I E L  
   – O is in word but not in spot 1 (clue: O(-))  
   – I is out  
   – E is in word but not in spot 4 (clue: E(-))  

So the current constraints are:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _  
- Letters that must appear: O and E  
  – O must be in spot 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 2[R])  
  – E must be in spot 1 or 3 (cannot be 2[R], 4, 5)  

Letters still allowed: all others except A S P V I

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: O is in 4  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ O _   (but E cannot be in 1 either because spot 1 is allowed; check)  
_ R E O _   (E in 3, O in 4)

Case 2: O is in 5  
Then E must be in 1 or 3  
Pattern options:  
E R _ _ O   (E in 1)  
_ R E _ O   (E in 3)

We need actual words fitting these patterns.

Looking at _ R E O _ (E in 3, O in 4):
Searching common five-letter words yields “BREED”, but it has two E’s and the feedback so far only guarantees one E. Not ideal.

Next, _ R _ E O (E in 4, O in 5) is ruled out because E cannot be in 4.

Next, E R _ O _ (E in 1, O in 4):
Looking for words: “ERUGO” (invalid), “ERGOT” – but T is still allowed – gives “ERGOT”. Check constraints:
- E in 1, R in 2, G in 3, O in 4, T in 5
- Letters used: E, R, G, O, T – all allowed (no A, S, P, V, I)
- O is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters.

“ERGOT” satisfies every constraint.

Guess 3: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(✓) I(x) E(-) L(x)
Guess 4: ERGOT -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the newest feedback:

ERGOT → E(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) T(x)

- Positions locked so far:
  1: E
  2: R
  3: (unknown; G is out)
  4: O
  5: (unknown; T is out)

Therefore the pattern is:
E R _ O _

Letters we know are absent: A, S, P, V, I, G, T  
Letters we know must appear: already E, R, O are placed.

Only positions 3 and 5 remain to be filled with letters not excluded so far and not repeating any used letters.

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting E R _ O _ using only allowed letters.

Candidates:
- ERBO_  → no common word
- ERCO_ → no
- ERDO_ → ERDOM? no
- ERFO_ → no
- ERHO_ → no
- ERKO_ → no
- ERLO_ → ERLOW? no
- ERMO_ → ERMO_? no
- ERNO_ → ERNOS? no
- ERUO_ → no
- ERWO_ → no
- ERYO_ → no

Let me switch to ER _ O _ with possible endings:
- ERDO_ → no
- ERBOR → no
Wait, let's list possible 3rd and 5th letters.

Valid English words matching E R _ O _:
- ERGOT (already used, T out)
- ERGON (nope, G out)
- ERBO_ → nothing
- ERBOW → not a word
- ERNOS → no
- ERBOS → no
- ERBOL → no
- ERNO_ → ERNOS not a word
- ERDO_ → nope

Wait, let's search systematically.

ERBOD → no
ERDOC → no
ERFOB → no
ERCOB → no
ERHOE → no
ERMOB → no
ERNOB → no

Wait, let me check ERBO_ — no. Maybe ERDO_ — no.

Actually, let's think of real words:
ERBOW — not listed
ERBOT — no
ERHOT — no
ERHOB — no
ERDOB — no
ERNOB — no
ERMOB — no
ERLO — no
ERKOB — no
ERFOB — no

Let me try ERDO_ — no
ERHOD — no
ERMOS — no
ERHOS — no
ERKOS — no
ERLOS — no
ERBOS — no

Let me check a word list mentally:
ERODE — but D and E are allowed, but E is already used in 1 and 4 has O, so EROD E? no, EROD_ 4th letter O, 5th E — but E is already used once in position 1, and the word must be 5 unique letters? No, repeats allowed unless clue indicates.

But feedback doesn't forbid repeats. However, we have no reason to suspect repeats yet.

ERODE: E R O D E — letters E, R, O, D, E  
This fits pattern E R _ O _ and uses allowed letters (D not excluded).

ERODE is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- Pattern: E R D O E
- No forbidden letters (A, S, P, V, I, G, T not present)
- Letters E, R, O already confirmed present and placed.

Therefore, ERODE is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback (ERODE → E(✓) R(✓) O(-) D(x) E(-)) we now know:

1. E must be in position 1 (already fixed).
2. R must be in position 2 (already fixed).
3. O must be in position 4 (from ERGOT) but in ERODE the 4th letter is O and the feedback says O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 4. This contradicts our earlier conclusion from ERGOT (O(✓)). The only resolution is that the ✓ in ERGOT meant O is correct in position 4, so the latest O(-) must be interpreted as a typo or mis-recording. However, following the feedback literally, the latest clue says O(-) for position 4, so O cannot be in position 4. This forces a re-evaluation.

Reconstructing all clues:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- R is fixed at 2.
- E is fixed at 1 (from ERGOT E(✓)).
- O must be in the word but NOT in 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in 4 (from ERODE O(-)), so O must be in 5.
- Therefore the pattern is: E R _ _ O
- Letters excluded so far: A, S, P, V, I, G, T, D, L
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, H, K, M, N, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word E R _ _ O with no excluded letters.

Candidates:
- ERBRO → no
- ERCOO → no
- ERCHO → no
- ERFRO → no
- ERBUO → no
- ERNCO → no
- ERUNO → no
- ERCOO → no
- ERBNO → no
- ERHUO → no

Real words:
- ERUGO → not valid
- ERBUO → no
- ERUNO → no

Let me systematically check:
- E R B O O → no
- E R C O O → no
- E R F O O → no
- E R H O O → no
- E R K O O → no
- E R M O O → no
- E R N O O → no
- E R U O O → no
- E R W O O → no
- E R Y O O → no

Wait, let's think of common words ending in -RO:
ERBRO — not a word
ERNCO — not
ERBNO — not
ERMUO — not
ERHUO — not

Actually, let's search for E R _ _ O patterns:
- ERBB O → no
- ERCO O → no
- ERMO O — ERMOO no
- ERNO O — ERNOO no
- ERKO O — ERKOO no

Let me think of valid words:
- ERUPO — no
- ERUGO — no
- ERBRO — no

Let me check a dictionary mentally:
- ERUPO — no
- ERUGO — no
- ERBRO — no

Wait, let's think of ""ERBRO"" — no. ""ERMBO"" — no. ""ERNBO"" — no. ""ERKBO"" — no.

Let me try E R N C O — no, C and N allowed but ""ERNCO"" not a word.

Real valid word: E R B O O — no
ERBBO — no
ERNNO — no
ERNCO — no
ERHCO — no
ERBHO — no

Let me try ERHOO — no
ERMOO — no
ERKOO — no
ERCOO — no

Wait, let me think of ""ERNCO"" — no, not a word.

Let me try ER N C O — no
ER M N O — no
ER B N O — no
ER C N O — no
ER F N O — no
ER H N O — no
ER M N O — no
ER K N O — no
ER U N O — no
ER W N O — no
ER Y N O — no

Let me try ER B U O — no
ER C U O — no
ER F U O — no
ER H U O — no
ER K U O — no
ER M U O — no
ER N U O — no
ER W U O — no
ER Y U O — no

Let me try ER N O W — but O must be last.

Let me think of ""ERBNO"" — no. ""ERMUO"" — no.

I realize I must have made an error in interpreting the latest feedback. Re-reading:

ERODE → E(✓) R(✓) O(-) D(x) E(-)

This is ambiguous without position numbers. Traditional Wordle-style feedback is given per position. Assuming the feedback is positional:

Position 1: E(✓) — E correct in 1
Position 2: R(✓) — R correct in 2
Position 3: O(-) — O in word, wrong position
Position 4: D(x) — D absent
Position 5: E(-) — E in word, wrong position

This interpretation makes more sense.

Therefore:
- Pattern: E R _ _ _
- O must be in 3 or 5 (since it was in 3 and got (-), meaning not 3, so O must be in 5)
- E must be in 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but 1 is E, 5 is O, so E must be in 3 or 4)
- But position 5 is O, so E must be in 3 or 4
- D is excluded

So possible patterns:
- E R E _ O  or  E R _ E O

But E cannot be in 3 and 5 simultaneously unless word has two E's.

Looking at E R E _ O:
Valid word: ERECT — but T excluded
EREBO — no
EREMO — no

E R _ E O:
ERCEO — no
ERNEO — no
ERWEO — no
ERBEO — no
