For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting letters in English words are S, T, R, N, and L, while vowels like A, E, I, O, U are essential. A balanced word like ""AROSE"" uses three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE – all five letters A, R, O, S, E are absent.
2. UNTIL – U, N, L are absent; T and I are present but in wrong positions.

Letters we now know are in the word: T, I  
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, C, M, P, B, F, K, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: none left except I (already confirmed), so the word must contain I and probably no other vowel (since the other four vowels A, E, O, U were ruled out). That’s unusual, so we should still allow for Y as a vowel-like letter.

Let’s build a word that includes T and I, avoids every banned letter, and places T and I in new positions (since both were “wrong position” last time).

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 5 (it was in 3rd spot last time)  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (it was in 4th spot last time)

A common word fitting these constraints is “ITCHY”:
- I, T, C, H, Y  
- All letters are from the allowed set.  
- T moves to 2nd position (was 3rd).  
- I moves to 1st position (was 4th).  

We haven’t used C, H, or Y yet, so “ITCHY” should give maximal new information.

Let’s consolidate what we know after three guesses.

Known absent letters  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y

Known present letters  
T, I, H

Known wrong positions  
T: must NOT be in positions 3 or 2 (was “-” in 3, then “-” in 2) ⇒ T must be in 1, 4, or 5  
I: must NOT be in positions 4, 1, or 3 (was “-” in 4, then “-” in 1) ⇒ I must be in 2 or 5  
H: must NOT be in position 4 (only place it’s appeared so far) ⇒ H can be 1, 2, 3, or 5

We still need two more letters.  From the remaining unused common consonants: D, G, M, P, B, F, K, W.

Let’s try to place the known letters first:
- T in 1, 4, or 5  
- I in 2 or 5  
- H anywhere except 4  

A simple pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
T _ I _ H  (T in 1, I in 3, H in 5) – but I cannot be in 3 (ruled out earlier).  
T _ _ I H  – I in 4 is ruled out.  
T _ _ H I  – I in 5 is allowed.  
But then we have T and H in 1 and 4, leaving positions 2 and 3 to fill.  

Another possibility:  
H _ I T _ – but T must be in 1, 4, or 5; here T is 4 (allowed), I is 3 (not allowed).  

A valid pattern:  
H _ _ T I  (T in 4, I in 5, H in 1) – all placements legal.

We still need two more letters that aren’t in the banned list and fit into positions 2 and 3.  Two common consonants we haven’t used yet are G and D.

That yields “HGDTI”, but that’s not a recognized English word.

Refine:  
Try “WIGHT”:  
W, I, G, H, T – all letters are not in the banned list.  
Positions:  
I is 2 (allowed), T is 5 (allowed), H is 4 (allowed).  
This satisfies every placement constraint.

So WIGHT seems valid and gives fresh information on three new letters (W, G).

T: must NOT be in positions 3 or 2 (was “-” in 3, then “-” in 2) ⇒ T must be in 1, 4, or 5  
I: must NOT be in positions 4, 1, or 3 (was “-” in 4, then “-” in 1) ⇒ I must be in 2 or 5  
H: must NOT be in position 4 (only place it’s appeared so far) ⇒ H can be 1, 2, 3, or 5

We still need two more letters.  From the remaining unused common consonants: D, G, M, P, B, F, K, W.

Let’s try to place the known letters first:
- T in 1, 4, or 5  
- I in 2 or 5  
- H anywhere except 4  

A simple pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
T _ I _ H  (T in 1, I in 3, H in 5) – but I cannot be in 3 (ruled out earlier).  
T _ _ I H  – I in 4 is ruled out.  
T _ _ H I  – I in 5 is allowed.  
But then we have T and H in 1 and 4, leaving positions 2 and 3 to fill.  

Another possibility:  
H _ I T _ – but T must be in 1, 4, or 5; here T is 4 (allowed), I is 3 (not allowed).  

A valid pattern:  
H _ _ T I  (T in 4, I in 5, H in 1) – all placements legal.

We still need two more letters that aren’t in the banned list and fit into positions 2 and 3.  Two common consonants we haven’t used yet are G and D.

That yields “HGDTI”, but that’s not a recognized English word.

Refine:  
Try “WIGHT”:  
W, I, G, H, T – all letters are not in the banned list.  
Positions:  
I is 2 (allowed), T is 5 (allowed), H is 4 (allowed).  
This satisfies every placement constraint.

So WIGHT seems valid and gives fresh information on three new letters (W, G).",Guess 4: WIGHT -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-),FAIL

Let’s list everything we now know.

Letters that are **NOT** in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y, W

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still wrong:
T, I, G, H   (all four were “-” in WIGHT)

So the secret word is built **only** from the four known letters T, I, G, H plus **one more letter** that has never been used.  
Available unused common letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- uses exactly the set {T, I, G, H} plus one of the unused consonants above,
- respects the positional restrictions accumulated so far.

Recall the positional bans derived:
- T cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (was 3 in UNTIL, 2 in ITCHY, 5 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ T must be in 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (was 4 in UNTIL, 1 in ITCHY, 2 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ I must be in 2 or 5.
- G cannot be in position 3 (was 3 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ G can be 1, 2, 4, 5.
- H cannot be in position 4 (was 4 in ITCHY)  
  ⇒ H can be 1, 2, 3, 5.

Try to make a valid arrangement.

Case 1: T in position 1  
   T _ _ _ _  
   I must then be in 2 or 5.  
   Try I in 2:   T I _ _ _  
   Remaining three spots need G, H, and the new consonant.  
   We still need a real word.  Check dictionary: “TIG… ” – nothing common (TIGER has E, which is banned).  
   Try I in 5:   T _ _ _ I  
   Then G and H and the new consonant must fill 2,3,4.  
   Possible word: T H I G ? – but 5th letter must be I, so we’d need 4 letters before it.  Doesn’t fit.

Case 2: T in position 4  
   _ _ _ T _  
   I must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 1,3,4).  
   Let’s put I in 2:   _ I _ T _  
   Remaining positions 1, 3, 5 must be G, H, and the unused consonant.  
   Dictionary check: among the unused consonants, D, K, M, etc.  
   The word “FIGHT” is perfect: F is unused, G, H, I, T are all present and satisfy every positional restriction.  
   Verify:  
   - Letters: {F, I, G, H, T} – no banned letters.  
   - T is in 5 → 5 is allowed (only 2,3,5 were banned earlier; 5 wasn’t banned before, only 2,3 were explicitly banned).  
     Wait – earlier I thought T was banned from 5 because of WIGHT, but in WIGHT T was in 5 and got (-), so 5 is **wrong** for T.  
     Therefore T cannot be in 5.  
     So “FIGHT” has T in 5 → violates the rule.  Discard.

   Try another word:  
   _ I _ T _ can’t be used; we need T in 4.  
   Let’s try I in 5:   _ _ _ T I  
   Then positions 1,2,3 must be G, H, and the new consonant.  
   Looking for real words:  
   “MIGHT” – M is unused, G, H, I, T are present.  
   Check positions:  
   T is in 4 (allowed), I is in 5 (allowed), G is in 3 (allowed), H is in 2 (allowed).  
   No banned letters.  “MIGHT” is a valid English word.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (it was in 4th spot last time)

A common word fitting these constraints is “ITCHY”:
- I, T, C, H, Y  
- All letters are from the allowed set.  
- T moves to 2nd position (was 3rd).  
- I moves to 1st position (was 4th).  

We haven’t used C, H, or Y yet, so “ITCHY” should give maximal new information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after three guesses.

Known absent letters  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y

Known present letters  
T, I, H

Known wrong positions  
T: must NOT be in positions 3 or 2 (was “-” in 3, then “-” in 2) ⇒ T must be in 1, 4, or 5  
I: must NOT be in positions 4, 1, or 3 (was “-” in 4, then “-” in 1) ⇒ I must be in 2 or 5  
H: must NOT be in position 4 (only place it’s appeared so far) ⇒ H can be 1, 2, 3, or 5

We still need two more letters.  From the remaining unused common consonants: D, G, M, P, B, F, K, W.

Let’s try to place the known letters first:
- T in 1, 4, or 5  
- I in 2 or 5  
- H anywhere except 4  

A simple pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
T _ I _ H  (T in 1, I in 3, H in 5) – but I cannot be in 3 (ruled out earlier).  
T _ _ I H  – I in 4 is ruled out.  
T _ _ H I  – I in 5 is allowed.  
But then we have T and H in 1 and 4, leaving positions 2 and 3 to fill.  

Another possibility:  
H _ I T _ – but T must be in 1, 4, or 5; here T is 4 (allowed), I is 3 (not allowed).  

A valid pattern:  
H _ _ T I  (T in 4, I in 5, H in 1) – all placements legal.

We still need two more letters that aren’t in the banned list and fit into positions 2 and 3.  Two common consonants we haven’t used yet are G and D.

That yields “HGDTI”, but that’s not a recognized English word.

Refine:  
Try “WIGHT”:  
W, I, G, H, T – all letters are not in the banned list.  
Positions:  
I is 2 (allowed), T is 5 (allowed), H is 4 (allowed).  
This satisfies every placement constraint.

So WIGHT seems valid and gives fresh information on three new letters (W, G).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list everything we now know.

Letters that are **NOT** in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y, W

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still wrong:
T, I, G, H   (all four were “-” in WIGHT)

So the secret word is built **only** from the four known letters T, I, G, H plus **one more letter** that has never been used.  
Available unused common letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- uses exactly the set {T, I, G, H} plus one of the unused consonants above,
- respects the positional restrictions accumulated so far.

Recall the positional bans derived:
- T cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (was 3 in UNTIL, 2 in ITCHY, 5 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ T must be in 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (was 4 in UNTIL, 1 in ITCHY, 2 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ I must be in 2 or 5.
- G cannot be in position 3 (was 3 in WIGHT)  
  ⇒ G can be 1, 2, 4, 5.
- H cannot be in position 4 (was 4 in ITCHY)  
  ⇒ H can be 1, 2, 3, 5.

Try to make a valid arrangement.

Case 1: T in position 1  
   T _ _ _ _  
   I must then be in 2 or 5.  
   Try I in 2:   T I _ _ _  
   Remaining three spots need G, H, and the new consonant.  
   We still need a real word.  Check dictionary: “TIG… ” – nothing common (TIGER has E, which is banned).  
   Try I in 5:   T _ _ _ I  
   Then G and H and the new consonant must fill 2,3,4.  
   Possible word: T H I G ? – but 5th letter must be I, so we’d need 4 letters before it.  Doesn’t fit.

Case 2: T in position 4  
   _ _ _ T _  
   I must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 1,3,4).  
   Let’s put I in 2:   _ I _ T _  
   Remaining positions 1, 3, 5 must be G, H, and the unused consonant.  
   Dictionary check: among the unused consonants, D, K, M, etc.  
   The word “FIGHT” is perfect: F is unused, G, H, I, T are all present and satisfy every positional restriction.  
   Verify:  
   - Letters: {F, I, G, H, T} – no banned letters.  
   - T is in 5 → 5 is allowed (only 2,3,5 were banned earlier; 5 wasn’t banned before, only 2,3 were explicitly banned).  
     Wait – earlier I thought T was banned from 5 because of WIGHT, but in WIGHT T was in 5 and got (-), so 5 is **wrong** for T.  
     Therefore T cannot be in 5.  
     So “FIGHT” has T in 5 → violates the rule.  Discard.

   Try another word:  
   _ I _ T _ can’t be used; we need T in 4.  
   Let’s try I in 5:   _ _ _ T I  
   Then positions 1,2,3 must be G, H, and the new consonant.  
   Looking for real words:  
   “MIGHT” – M is unused, G, H, I, T are present.  
   Check positions:  
   T is in 4 (allowed), I is in 5 (allowed), G is in 3 (allowed), H is in 2 (allowed).  
   No banned letters.  “MIGHT” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next best guess is MIGHT.
