- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Common first guesses include words like:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)
- REACT (uses R, E, A, C, T)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R (very common), A, I, S, E - covering 5 of the top 6 most frequent letters in English, which should give good initial information about the secret word.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first; now we know it isn’t in the first spot).
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (the fifth spot).

So the secret word ends in “E” and contains an “R” somewhere other than the first letter. The remaining letters must be drawn from the unused set: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z.

I want to keep using high-frequency consonants and include the now-known “R” in a new position. A good second-guess pattern is to place R in the second, third, or fourth slot while avoiding the already-eliminated letters.

A strong candidate is “ROUTE”:
- R is now in the second position.
- O and U are common vowels still available.
- T is a very common consonant.
- E is already confirmed in the fifth spot.

This covers new high-frequency letters and keeps R in a different spot.

Current known facts:

3. Letters A, I, S, O, U, T are not in the word at all.

Remaining consonant candidates (high frequency): N, L, C, D, G, B, F, H, M, etc.
Remaining vowels: None left—E is the only vowel confirmed so far.
