For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information. A good starting word should contain common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I’ll go with **CRANE** because it includes a mix of very common consonants (C, R, N) and common vowels (A, E), which should help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (marked ✓).

So the target word looks like: _ _ _ _ E, and none of C, R, A, N can appear anywhere.

Now I need a new guess that:
1. Ends with E, and
2. Uses five distinct letters that do NOT include C, R, A, N.

Good letters left that are common include: S, T, L, D, H, M, B, K, I, O, U, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that mixes unused common consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
A candidate: “HOUSE” – H, O, U, S, E – none of the banned letters appear and it ends in E.

Let me verify:
- H, O, U, S are all permissible.
- Ends in E.

Looks good.

From the latest feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: HOUSE → H(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)

What we now know:

Position map (1-5):  
1: _ (cannot be C, R, A, N, U; H is in word but wrong spot)  
2: _ (cannot be C, R, A, N, U; O is in word but wrong spot)  
3: _ (cannot be C, R, A, N, U; E is already fixed at 5)  
4: S (✓)  
5: E (✓)

Letters in the word somewhere (but not yet placed): H, O, S (S is fixed at 4), so really just H and O.

Letters ruled out entirely: C, R, A, N, U.

The pattern so far: _ _ _ S E  
We still need to place H and O in positions 1, 2, or 3 without repeating any letters.

Common 5-letter words ending in “S E” that also contain H and O are limited. Trying:

- H O _ S E → “HOISE” (not a common word)  
- O H _ S E → “OH… ” – no common word.  
- _ H O S E → we have the word “HOSES” but S is already at 4 and can’t repeat.  
- _ O H S E → “MOHSE” – not a word.  
- H _ O S E → “HO… ” – “HOISE” again (rare).  
- O _ H S E → “OCHSE” – no.

Another candidate that uses fresh common letters and satisfies constraints:  
“POISE” – but I has not been ruled in or out yet, and P, I are still allowed, but we still have to place O and H.  
We must place O and H in the three open slots (1-3).

A better fresh attempt: “THOSE”  
Letters: T, H, O, S, E  
- S and E already confirmed in correct spots.  
- O and H must appear but not in their old positions (O was at 2, now at 3; H was at 1, now at 2).  
- T is new but permissible (not ruled out).

Check:  
Pattern: T H O S E  
Positions:  
1: T – new letter, allowed  
2: H – allowed, was “wrong position” at 1, now at 2 (OK)  
3: O – allowed, was “wrong position” at 2, now at 3 (OK)

5: E – already ✓
