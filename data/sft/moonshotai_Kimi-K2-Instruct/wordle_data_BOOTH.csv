This is the first guess, so there's no feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a word that will give maximum information by covering common letters and positions. A common strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants.

Some good starter words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: A common consonant that appears in many words.
- R: One of the most common consonants.
- A: The most common vowel.
- N: Another common consonant.
- E: The most common vowel in English.

This word is likely to hit at least some letters in many possible secret words, giving good initial feedback.

From the new feedback:

- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it appeared in position 2).
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, D.
- O is definitely in position 3 (third letter).
- T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains T somewhere (but not in position 2).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining common letters we haven't tried: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s pick a word that fits these constraints. A possible choice is “MIGHT” (but G and H haven’t been tried yet). However, MIGHT has T in position 4, which is allowed since T cannot be in position 2.

Let me verify:
- M (not tried)
- I (not tried)
- G (not tried)
- H (not tried)
- T (allowed in position 4)
- O is not in MIGHT, so this doesn’t work. I need O in position 3.

Oops, I need a word with O in the third position. Let me think of valid words with O in the middle and T somewhere else (not position 2).

Possible candidates:
- B O T T O – invalid (duplicates, letters not allowed).
- P I T O N – but O is in position 4, not 3.
- M O T T O – again duplicates and O is in position 2 and 5.

Let me systematically list valid options:
- _ _ O _ _ where T is elsewhere and other letters are from remaining pool.

Possible words:
- “POINT” – O in position 3, T in position 5 (allowed), and P, I, N are used. But N was already eliminated in CRANE, so N is invalid.
- “BLOOM” – O in position 3, but L is eliminated and M is allowed, but O is in position 3. However, L is eliminated.
- “GLOOM” – same issue with L.
- “VIGOR” – but O is in position 4.
- “MOTOR” – but O is in positions 2 and 4, and R is eliminated.

Wait, I’m struggling to find a common word. Let me try “WITOU” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Another approach: From remaining letters (B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y, T), and O in position 3.

Try “MOUTH”:
- M (valid)
- O (position 3, correct)
- U (valid)
- T (position 4, allowed since T isn’t in position 2)
- H (valid)

Check if MOUTH uses any eliminated letters: M, O, U, T, H – none were previously eliminated. Also, T is in position 4 (allowed) and O is in position 3 (correct). This seems like a strong candidate.

- “MOTOR” – but O is in positions 2 and 4, and R is eliminated.

Wait, I’m struggling to find a common word. Let me try “WITOU” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Another approach: From remaining letters (B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y, T), and O in position 3.

Try “MOUTH”:
- M (valid)
- O (position 3, correct)
- U (valid)
- T (position 4, allowed since T isn’t in position 2)
- H (valid)

Check if MOUTH uses any eliminated letters: M, O, U, T, H – none were previously eliminated. Also, T is in position 4 (allowed) and O is in position 3 (correct). This seems like a strong candidate.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters completely out: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, D, M, U  
- Known positions:
  – 3rd letter: O (✓)  
  – 4th letter: T (✓)  
  – 5th letter: H (✓)

So the word has the pattern: _ _ O T H  
Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, I, K, P, V, W, Y

We need two different consonants for positions 1 and 2, both from the list above.  
Common starting digraphs with OTHI:  
- B, F, G, P, W are all plausible.

Quick scan of valid 5-letter words:  
- B   O   T   H   →  “BOTH” is 4 letters, not 5.  
- P   O   T   H   →  “POTHO” isn’t a word.  
- G   O   T   H   →  “GOTHA” isn’t correct.  
- F   O   T   H   →  “FOTHO” isn’t valid.  
- W   O   T   H   →  “WOTHA” isn’t valid.

Wait—what about “FOOTH”?  Doesn’t help.  
Real pattern: _ _ O T H

Valid word: “POOTH” – not in dictionary.  
Another: “BOOTH” – uses B and O, but O is already set in position 3, and B is allowed.

“BOOTH”:
- B (allowed)  
- O (already fixed at position 3)  
- O again at position 2 → duplicate O, but we don’t know yet if O can repeat; none of the feedback forbids it.  
- T (fixed at 4)  
- H (fixed at 5)

Let me check: O is only required once so far (position 3), so position 2 could be another O, but “BOOTH” has O twice (positions 2 & 3). That’s acceptable because the feedback never indicated O can’t repeat.  
“BOOTH” is a valid English word and fits the pattern.

So the next logical guess is:
