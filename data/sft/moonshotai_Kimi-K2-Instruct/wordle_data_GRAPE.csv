For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Some effective starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" These contain frequently used letters in English words. 

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This provides good coverage of common letters in different positions, helping maximize information gain from the first guess.

Current known facts:

2. Does not contain S, L, T, B, V anywhere.
3. Uses new common consonants to test other positions (1st and 4th).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CRANE – but BRAVE already tested R in pos 2 and A in pos 3, and C is allowed, but N would be 4th. However, this contradicts because we'd have CRA_E, which would be CRANE, but N is allowed.

- DRANK – invalid (K conflicts with E in 5th).
- GRADE – G is new, D is new, fits G R A D E. This fits perfectly: GRADE has G in 1st, R in 2nd, A in 3rd, D in 4th, E in 5th. No forbidden letters.

Some effective starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" These contain frequently used letters in English words. \n\nAmong these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common ending letter)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis provides good coverage of common letters in different positions, helping maximize information gain from the first guess.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- L(x) – L is not in the word.\n- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the exact 3rd position.\n- T(x) – T is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.\n\nSo the pattern of the secret word is:\n- _ _ A _ E\n- No S, L, or T may appear anywhere.\n- A and E are placed correctly.\n\nI want a word that:\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. Pattern locked as: _ R A _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 are R, A, E respectively).
2. Forbidden letters: S, L, T, B, V, D.
3. Latest feedback confirmed G is in position 1, so the word now must start with G and end in R A _ E.

Thus the word form is: G R A _ E with only the 4th letter unknown.

Allowed letters for the 4th position (not yet ruled out and not used): C, F, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English 5-letter words starting with G R A _ E:
- GRAPE
- GRAVE (but V is forbidden)
- GRATE (but T is forbidden)
- GRAZE (but Z is rare and Z is allowed)
- GRACE (but C is allowed)

Among these, GRAPE and GRACE are most plausible.

Of the two:
- GRAPE: P is allowed (not yet ruled out).
- GRACE: C is allowed (not yet ruled out).

Between these, GRAPE is more common and likely.
