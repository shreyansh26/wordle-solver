For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

After considering various options like ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I believe ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels in English
2. It has two very common consonants (R, S)
3. It has no repeating letters
4. It allows testing for multiple common letter combinations

This should give us good coverage to understand the structure of the secret word.

From the first guess (AROSE), every single letter was marked as “x”, which means none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a huge amount of pruning power: we can immediately eliminate any word that contains any of those five letters, including common vowels and consonants like R, S, and E.

To maximize information gain on the next turn, I want a word that:
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- still contains a good mix of remaining common vowels and consonants  
- is a valid 5-letter English word

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters we have not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, Y), I can build a new candidate.

One strong choice is “UNITY”:
- it uses U and I (two common vowels we haven’t tried)  
- it uses N, T, Y (common consonants we haven’t tried)  
- it contains no forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E)  
- it’s a valid English word  
- the letters are all distinct, maximizing coverage

Next-best alternatives might include “UNTIL”, “MOUND”, or “BUILD”, but “UNITY” seems optimal here.

Current deductions:

- Letters confirmed in the word: I (exactly once, and is in position 3).  
- Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed: N and Y (both not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
- Still-untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, plus the confirmed letters N, Y, I.

4. is a valid English word.

Scanning the dictionary, one word that immediately satisfies these constraints is “NINNY”.

Check:
- I is in position 3 (✓).  
- Contains both N and Y.  
- Contains no forbidden letters.  
- N appears twice—this is useful because it tests the possibility of a repeated N, and the extra N also lets us place one N in a different spot to check positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

After considering various options like ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I believe ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels in English
2. It has two very common consonants (R, S)
3. It has no repeating letters
4. It allows testing for multiple common letter combinations

This should give us good coverage to understand the structure of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE), every single letter was marked as “x”, which means none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a huge amount of pruning power: we can immediately eliminate any word that contains any of those five letters, including common vowels and consonants like R, S, and E.

To maximize information gain on the next turn, I want a word that:
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- still contains a good mix of remaining common vowels and consonants  
- is a valid 5-letter English word

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters we have not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, Y), I can build a new candidate.

One strong choice is “UNITY”:
- it uses U and I (two common vowels we haven’t tried)  
- it uses N, T, Y (common consonants we haven’t tried)  
- it contains no forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E)  
- it’s a valid English word  
- the letters are all distinct, maximizing coverage

Next-best alternatives might include “UNTIL”, “MOUND”, or “BUILD”, but “UNITY” seems optimal here.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(✓) T(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

- Letters completely ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.  
- Letters confirmed in the word: I (exactly once, and is in position 3).  
- Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed: N and Y (both not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
- Still-untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, plus the confirmed letters N, Y, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. contains I in position 3,
2. contains both N and Y (positions unknown, but N ≠ 2 and Y ≠ 5),
3. uses none of the eliminated letters A, R, O, S, E, U, T,
4. is a valid English word.

Scanning the dictionary, one word that immediately satisfies these constraints is “NINNY”.

Check:
- I is in position 3 (✓).  
- Contains both N and Y.  
- Contains no forbidden letters.  
- N appears twice—this is useful because it tests the possibility of a repeated N, and the extra N also lets us place one N in a different spot to check positions.

Therefore “NINNY” is a good next guess.

From the feedback on LYING, every letter from position 2 onward is correct:

- Position 3: I ✓  
- Position 4: N ✓  
- Position 5: G ✓  

This leaves only the first letter unknown.  
We already know the first letter cannot be any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L (because L was marked x).  
Allowed unused consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z (plus possibly others not yet eliminated).

A quick scan of valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern ?YING gives:

B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z as possible first letters.

Common words among these:
- BYING (archaic form of “buying,” but often accepted in word lists)  
- CYING (not a standard word)  
- DYING (definitely valid)  
- FYING (not standard)  
- HYING (valid, meaning “hastening”)

- PYING (valid, present participle of “to pye,” though uncommon)  
- VYING (valid, present participle of “vie”)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. 

After considering various options like ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""CRANE"", I believe ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels in English
2. It has two very common consonants (R, S)
3. It has no repeating letters
4. It allows testing for multiple common letter combinations

This should give us good coverage to understand the structure of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE), every single letter was marked as “x”, which means none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a huge amount of pruning power: we can immediately eliminate any word that contains any of those five letters, including common vowels and consonants like R, S, and E.

To maximize information gain on the next turn, I want a word that:
- uses none of A, R, O, S, E  
- still contains a good mix of remaining common vowels and consonants  
- is a valid 5-letter English word

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters we have not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, Y), I can build a new candidate.

One strong choice is “UNITY”:
- it uses U and I (two common vowels we haven’t tried)  
- it uses N, T, Y (common consonants we haven’t tried)  
- it contains no forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E)  
- it’s a valid English word  
- the letters are all distinct, maximizing coverage

Next-best alternatives might include “UNTIL”, “MOUND”, or “BUILD”, but “UNITY” seems optimal here.

<guess>UNITY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(✓) T(x) Y(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

- Letters completely ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.  
- Letters confirmed in the word: I (exactly once, and is in position 3).  
- Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed: N and Y (both not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
- Still-untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, plus the confirmed letters N, Y, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. contains I in position 3,
2. contains both N and Y (positions unknown, but N ≠ 2 and Y ≠ 5),
3. uses none of the eliminated letters A, R, O, S, E, U, T,
4. is a valid English word.

Scanning the dictionary, one word that immediately satisfies these constraints is “NINNY”.

Check:
- I is in position 3 (✓).  
- Contains both N and Y.  
- Contains no forbidden letters.  
- N appears twice—this is useful because it tests the possibility of a repeated N, and the extra N also lets us place one N in a different spot to check positions.

Therefore “NINNY” is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(✓) T(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: NINNY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(-) N(-) N(✓) Y(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated deductions after Guess 3 (NINNY):

1. **Letters ruled out entirely**: A, R, O, S, E, U, T  
2. **Letters we know exist in the word**:  
   - I (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 3)  
   - N (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3) – so N must be in 4 or 5  
   - Y (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5) – so Y must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  
3. **Confirmed positional info**:  
   - N is in position 4 (from NINNY feedback: N(✓) in slot 4)  
   - Therefore N is fixed in slot 4: _ _ _ N _  

4. **Remaining constraints**  
   - Need to place I somewhere (not 3) → only slots 1, 2, or 5 are possible for I.  
   - Need to place Y somewhere (not 5) → only slots 1, 2, or 3 are possible for Y.  
   - Need two more consonants that haven’t been tried yet and are not in the banned list.  
   - No repeats of any letters we’ve already placed (N is already used once, I and Y at most once each).

5. **Candidate list**  
   Quickly scan 5-letter words matching the pattern _ _ _ N _ with letters allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, X, Z plus the already-known I, N, Y.

   One word that satisfies:
   - Contains I (can be in 1, 2, or 5)  
   - Contains Y (can be in 1, 2, or 3)  
   - Uses only allowed letters and no banned ones  
   - Is valid English: “Lying” → but L not tested yet, looks good.

   Check:
   - L (unused), Y (must be present), I (must be present), N (fixed in 4), G (unused).  
   - Pattern: L Y I N G → matches _ _ I N _ (but feedback says N must be in 4, so that fits).  
   - No banned letters.  

Another candidate: “Cynic” → contains C and C, but that’s a repeat letter C and Y/I already placed.  

Simplest valid unique-letter word: “LYING”.  

Check positions:
- L (new)  
- Y (must be present)  
- I (must be present)  
- N (fixed in 4)  
- G (new)  

No conflicts. Let’s try LYING.

<guess>LYING</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(✓) T(x) Y(-)
Guess 3: NINNY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(-) N(-) N(✓) Y(-)
Guess 4: LYING -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on LYING, every letter from position 2 onward is correct:

- Position 2: Y ✓  
- Position 3: I ✓  
- Position 4: N ✓  
- Position 5: G ✓  

This leaves only the first letter unknown.  
We already know the first letter cannot be any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L (because L was marked x).  
Allowed unused consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z (plus possibly others not yet eliminated).

A quick scan of valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern ?YING gives:

B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z as possible first letters.

Common words among these:
- BYING (archaic form of “buying,” but often accepted in word lists)  
- CYING (not a standard word)  
- DYING (definitely valid)  
- FYING (not standard)  
- HYING (valid, meaning “hastening”)  
- KYING (not standard)  
- MYING (not standard)  
- PYING (valid, present participle of “to pye,” though uncommon)  
- VYING (valid, present participle of “vie”)  
- WYING (not standard)  
- ZYING (not standard)

Between the plausible standard English words, the two strongest are DYING and VYING.  
Since we have only one letter left to find, either would be a valid final guess.  
Let’s try the more common one first.
