For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to cover as many frequently used letters as possible. 

Looking at letter frequencies in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Possible good first guesses include:
- ""AROSE"" (has A, R, O, S, E - covers many top letters)
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong because it includes 4 vowels (A, O, E) plus S, covering very common letters. It also doesn't have any repeating letters, which is beneficial for maximizing information.

Therefore, ""AROSE"" is my first guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

1. Guess 1: AROSE
   - A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - O(x)  → O is not in the word.
   - S(x)  → S is not in the word.
   - E(✓)  → E is in position 5.

2. Guess 2: CRANE
   - C(x)  → C is not in the word.
   - R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in CRANE the A was in position 3 and was marked wrong-position).
   - N(-)  → N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E(✓)  → E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So the word:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Must contain: A, R, N.
- Must not contain: C, O, S.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending with E that includes A, R, N with those positional constraints.

Let’s try to list possible words fitting these constraints.

We know the pattern is _ _ _ _ E.
We have A, R, N to place in positions 1-4, with:
- A not in 1 or 3
- R not in 2
- N not in 4

Positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4 (4th is N, but N cannot be in 4, so N must be in 1,2, or 3)

Possible arrangements:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3
- A must be in 2 or 4 (but 4 is N’s exclusion, so 2)
Wait, 4 is excluded for N, but A can be in 2 or 4? But 4 cannot be A because we already have E in 5, and A could be in 4, but N is excluded from 4, so A could be in 4.

Let me re-examine constraints:
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (since not 1 or 3)
- R must be in 1, 3, or 4 (since not 2)
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3 (since not 4)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: A in position 2
Then R and N must be in 1,3,4 with:
- R not in 2 (already 2 is A)
- N not in 4
So:
- position 2: A
- positions 1,3,4: need to place R and N with N not in 4
Possible:
- 1: N
- 2: A
- 3: R
- 4: ? but we already have N(-) meaning N is in word but not in 4, and we have N in 1, so 4 is free for another letter but we've used A,R,N,E. So what's left? The word must be exactly 5 letters with these letters.

Wait, the word must contain A, R, N, E (with E fixed at 5), and no other constraints on letters except not C,O,S.

So we need to place A, R, N into positions 1-4 with:
- A not in 1 or 3
- R not in 2
- N not in 4
- E in 5

Possible valid arrangements:
1. N A R _ E → but 4th must be a letter (but we've used A,R,N,E, so it would have to be a duplicate or another letter, but we don't know others yet)
2. R A N _ E → but N is in 3, which is allowed, and 4 is free (but we've used R,A,N,E, so 4th would need to be one of these, but they're already used)
This seems like we need another letter that isn't A,R,N,E, and isn't C,O,S.

Looking for actual words: we have A, R, N, E and need a fifth letter (not C,O,S).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to find words ending in E with A, R, N plus one more letter.

One candidate is ""RANGE"":
- R A N G E
Check constraints:
- Ends with E: yes
- Contains A, R, N: yes
- Does not contain C, O, S: yes
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 3)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not 2)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, not 4)
- G is new letter, good to test
- E is in 5: yes
This seems valid.

Another candidate is ""ANGER"":
- A N G E R
But this ends with R, not E, so invalid.

""GRAPE"" doesn't have N.

""HEART"" doesn't end with E.

""WARNE"" is not a word.

""BRANE"" (physics term) might be acceptable:
- B R A N E
Check:
- Ends with E
- Contains A, R, N
- A in 3: but A cannot be in 3 (from CRANE feedback A(-) in position 3)
So BRANE is invalid because A is in 3.

""TRANE"" (brand name, possibly acceptable)
- T R A N E
But A is in 3: invalid.

""DRANE"" – not a word.

""FRANE"" – not a word.

""PRANE"" – not a word.

""GRANE"" – not a word.

""HRANE"" – not a word.

""LRANE"" – not a word.

""MRANE"" – not a word.

""NRANE"" – not a word.

""QRANE"" – not a word.

""XRANE"" – not a word.

""YRANE"" – not a word.

""ZRANE"" – not a word.

So ""RANGE"" seems the best candidate.

But let me double-check:
RANGE:
- R (1): allowed (not in 2)
- A (2): allowed (not in 1 or 3)
- N (3): allowed (not in 4)
- G (4): new
- E (5): correct
No forbidden letters (C, O, S), and includes A, R, N as required.

Therefore, RANGE is a good next guess.

- N must be in 1, 2, or 3 (since not 4)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: A in position 2
Then R and N must be in 1,3,4 with:
- R not in 2 (already 2 is A)
- N not in 4
So:
- position 2: A
- positions 1,3,4: need to place R and N with N not in 4
Possible:
- 1: N
- 2: A
- 3: R
- 4: ? but we already have N(-) meaning N is in word but not in 4, and we have N in 1, so 4 is free for another letter but we've used A,R,N,E. So what's left? The word must be exactly 5 letters with these letters.

Wait, the word must contain A, R, N, E (with E fixed at 5), and no other constraints on letters except not C,O,S.

So we need to place A, R, N into positions 1-4 with:
- A not in 1 or 3
- R not in 2
- N not in 4
- E in 5

Possible valid arrangements:
1. N A R _ E → but 4th must be a letter (but we've used A,R,N,E, so it would have to be a duplicate or another letter, but we don't know others yet)
2. R A N _ E → but N is in 3, which is allowed, and 4 is free (but we've used R,A,N,E, so 4th would need to be one of these, but they're already used)
This seems like we need another letter that isn't A,R,N,E, and isn't C,O,S.

Looking for actual words: we have A, R, N, E and need a fifth letter (not C,O,S).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to find words ending in E with A, R, N plus one more letter.

One candidate is ""RANGE"":
- R A N G E
Check constraints:
- Ends with E: yes
- Contains A, R, N: yes
- Does not contain C, O, S: yes
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 3)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not 2)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, not 4)
- G is new letter, good to test
- E is in 5: yes
This seems valid.

Another candidate is ""ANGER"":
- A N G E R
But this ends with R, not E, so invalid.

""GRAPE"" doesn't have N.

""HEART"" doesn't end with E.

""WARNE"" is not a word.

""BRANE"" (physics term) might be acceptable:
- B R A N E
Check:
- Ends with E
- Contains A, R, N
- A in 3: but A cannot be in 3 (from CRANE feedback A(-) in position 3)
So BRANE is invalid because A is in 3.

""TRANE"" (brand name, possibly acceptable)
- T R A N E
But A is in 3: invalid.

""DRANE"" – not a word.

""FRANE"" – not a word.

""PRANE"" – not a word.

""GRANE"" – not a word.

""HRANE"" – not a word.

""LRANE"" – not a word.

""MRANE"" – not a word.

""NRANE"" – not a word.

""QRANE"" – not a word.

""XRANE"" – not a word.

""YRANE"" – not a word.

""ZRANE"" – not a word.

So ""RANGE"" seems the best candidate.

But let me double-check:
RANGE:
- R (1): allowed (not in 2)
- A (2): allowed (not in 1 or 3)
- N (3): allowed (not in 4)
- G (4): new
- E (5): correct
No forbidden letters (C, O, S), and includes A, R, N as required.

Therefore, RANGE is a good next guess.",Guess 3: RANGE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
