This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good starting strategy is to guess a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting hits. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

I should choose a word that uses these letters efficiently. A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives me a good chance of getting at least one or two letters right in the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and E are in the correct positions (1st and 5th).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R and O are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is A _ _ _ E with an S somewhere in the middle three spots. My next guess should keep A and E in place, avoid R/O entirely, and test S in one of those middle positions.

Good candidate letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) and vowels like I or U. Since S must go in position 2, 3, or 4, let’s try placing S in position 2 and test some new consonants.

Possible guess: A S T E N → but this has E in position 4, which conflicts with known E in position 5. Adjust to ASTEN (but E already used correctly in position 5). Better to test new consonants in positions 3-4.

Another approach: A S I D E → but E is already in position 5. So ASIDE works (S in 2, I/D in 3-4). Let me check ASIDE:
- Keeps A and E correct.
- Places S in position 2 (could be correct or needs moving).
- Tests new letters I and D.

This seems efficient.
