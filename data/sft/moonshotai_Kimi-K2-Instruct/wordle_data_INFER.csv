For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to include several of these common letters to quickly determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the word:
- definitely contains an E, but not in the 5th position.
- definitely does **not** contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.

I should pick a word with new, common letters to maximize information. Good choices for remaining common letters are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters.
- E appears in position 5 (but feedback says E can’t be in position 5 — wait, that violates rule 2. Oops!)
  
So I need E not in position 5. Let me try “HONEY”:
- H, O, N, Y are new letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Does not include S, L, A, T.

Let me summarize the constraints we have after three guesses.

Guess 1: SLATE → S, L, A, T are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Guess 2: HONEY → H, O, Y are not in the word (x), N is in the word but not in position 3 (-), E is in position 4 (✓).

Guess 3: NERVE → N is in the word but not in position 1 (-), E is in the word but not in position 2 (-), R is in the word but not in position 3 (-), V is not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Summary of constraints:
- E is in the word, and from HONEY we know it must be in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- N is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from NERVE it can't be in 1, from HONEY it can't be in 3, and position 2 would have been marked ✓ if correct). So N must be in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from NERVE it's not in 3, and position 4 is E). So R must be in position 1.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V.
- We have positions 1, 2, 3 to fill, with position 4 = E and position 5 = N.

So far we have: R _ _ E N

Letters we've used so far: R, E, N
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V
Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a valid 5-letter word in the form R _ _ E N. Let's think of possible candidates:

- R I P E N - ""rip"" + ""en"" = ""ripen"" (a valid word)
- R A M E N - but A is banned
- R U M E N - ""rumen"" (also valid, but less common)
- R O D E N - O is banned
- R U D E N - not a valid word

""RIPEN"" seems to be the best candidate here:
- R in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- I, P in positions 2,3 (new letters, not banned)
- E in position 4 (matches confirmation)
- N in position 5 (matches our deduction)
- No banned letters are used

Let's verify:
- Letters used: R, I, P, E, N - none are in the banned list
- Position constraints: N is in 5 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), R is in 1 (allowed)
- Word is valid 5-letter English word

This appears to be the correct guess.
</think>

Based on the constraints derived from previous feedback, the only valid word that fits is:

<guess>RIPEN</guess>",RIPEN,"Let me summarize the constraints we have after three guesses.

Guess 1: SLATE → S, L, A, T are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Guess 2: HONEY → H, O, Y are not in the word (x), N is in the word but not in position 3 (-), E is in position 4 (✓).

Guess 3: NERVE → N is in the word but not in position 1 (-), E is in the word but not in position 2 (-), R is in the word but not in position 3 (-), V is not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Summary of constraints:
- E is in the word, and from HONEY we know it must be in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- N is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from NERVE it can't be in 1, from HONEY it can't be in 3, and position 2 would have been marked ✓ if correct). So N must be in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from NERVE it's not in 3, and position 4 is E). So R must be in position 1.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V.
- We have positions 1, 2, 3 to fill, with position 4 = E and position 5 = N.

So far we have: R _ _ E N

Letters we've used so far: R, E, N
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V
Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a valid 5-letter word in the form R _ _ E N. Let's think of possible candidates:

- R I P E N - ""rip"" + ""en"" = ""ripen"" (a valid word)
- R A M E N - but A is banned
- R U M E N - ""rumen"" (also valid, but less common)
- R O D E N - O is banned
- R U D E N - not a valid word

""RIPEN"" seems to be the best candidate here:
- R in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- I, P in positions 2,3 (new letters, not banned)
- E in position 4 (matches confirmation)
- N in position 5 (matches our deduction)
- No banned letters are used

Let's verify:
- Letters used: R, I, P, E, N - none are in the banned list
- Position constraints: N is in 5 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), R is in 1 (allowed)
- Word is valid 5-letter English word

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,INFER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to include several of these common letters to quickly determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the word:
- definitely contains an E, but not in the 5th position.
- definitely does **not** contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.

I should pick a word with new, common letters to maximize information. Good choices for remaining common letters are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters.
- E appears in position 5 (but feedback says E can’t be in position 5 — wait, that violates rule 2. Oops!)
  
So I need E not in position 5. Let me try “HONEY”:
- H, O, N, Y are new letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Does not include S, L, A, T.

This seems valid.

<guess>HONEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T  
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HONEY → H(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)  
- Letters not in the word: H, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 3.  
- Letter E is confirmed in position 4 (since it was marked ✓ in position 4).

So the target word:
- Has E in position 4.
- Has N somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, H, O, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with E in the 4th position and N somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). The remaining letters must avoid all the excluded letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z (plus N).

Let’s think of a word meeting these constraints:
- 4th letter = E
- N appears in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
- No banned letters

For example, N in position 1: N _ _ E _  
Possible candidates: NERVE, NINER, NEWER (but W is allowed), etc.

NERVE:
- N is in position 1 (allowed, not in position 3)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- R, V are not banned
- Doesn’t violate any feedback.

Let me verify:
- Uses N in position 1 (not position 3, so OK)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- No S, L, A, T, H, O, Y
- Valid 5-letter word

This seems like the best next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me summarize the constraints we have after three guesses.

Guess 1: SLATE → S, L, A, T are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Guess 2: HONEY → H, O, Y are not in the word (x), N is in the word but not in position 3 (-), E is in position 4 (✓).

Guess 3: NERVE → N is in the word but not in position 1 (-), E is in the word but not in position 2 (-), R is in the word but not in position 3 (-), V is not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Summary of constraints:
- E is in the word, and from HONEY we know it must be in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- N is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from NERVE it can't be in 1, from HONEY it can't be in 3, and position 2 would have been marked ✓ if correct). So N must be in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from NERVE it's not in 3, and position 4 is E). So R must be in position 1.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V.
- We have positions 1, 2, 3 to fill, with position 4 = E and position 5 = N.

So far we have: R _ _ E N

Letters we've used so far: R, E, N
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V
Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a valid 5-letter word in the form R _ _ E N. Let's think of possible candidates:

- R I P E N - ""rip"" + ""en"" = ""ripen"" (a valid word)
- R A M E N - but A is banned
- R U M E N - ""rumen"" (also valid, but less common)
- R O D E N - O is banned
- R U D E N - not a valid word

""RIPEN"" seems to be the best candidate here:
- R in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- I, P in positions 2,3 (new letters, not banned)
- E in position 4 (matches confirmation)
- N in position 5 (matches our deduction)
- No banned letters are used

Let's verify:
- Letters used: R, I, P, E, N - none are in the banned list
- Position constraints: N is in 5 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), R is in 1 (allowed)

Wait — let’s carefully list the “-” feedback for every letter that is “in the word but wrong position”.

From Guess 2 (HONEY): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 3.
From Guess 3 (NERVE): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 1.
From Guess 4 (RIPEN): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore N cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Position 4 is already E, so N must be in position 2.

Similarly for R:
From Guess 3 (NERVE): R(-) means R is in the word but not at position 3.
From Guess 4 (RIPEN): R(-) means R is in the word but not at position 1.
So R cannot be in positions 1 or 3. Position 4 is E, position 2 will be N, so R must be in position 5.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,INFER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to include several of these common letters to quickly determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the **wrong position** (-).

So the word:
- definitely contains an E, but not in the 5th position.
- definitely does **not** contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T.

I should pick a word with new, common letters to maximize information. Good choices for remaining common letters are R, N, I, O, U, C, H, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters.
- E appears in position 5 (but feedback says E can’t be in position 5 — wait, that violates rule 2. Oops!)
  
So I need E not in position 5. Let me try “HONEY”:
- H, O, N, Y are new letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Does not include S, L, A, T.

This seems valid.

<guess>HONEY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T  
- Letter E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HONEY → H(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)  
- Letters not in the word: H, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but not in position 3.  
- Letter E is confirmed in position 4 (since it was marked ✓ in position 4).

So the target word:
- Has E in position 4.
- Has N somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, H, O, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with E in the 4th position and N somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). The remaining letters must avoid all the excluded letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z (plus N).

Let’s think of a word meeting these constraints:
- 4th letter = E
- N appears in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
- No banned letters

For example, N in position 1: N _ _ E _  
Possible candidates: NERVE, NINER, NEWER (but W is allowed), etc.

NERVE:
- N is in position 1 (allowed, not in position 3)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- R, V are not banned
- Doesn’t violate any feedback.

Let me verify:
- Uses N in position 1 (not position 3, so OK)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- No S, L, A, T, H, O, Y
- Valid 5-letter word

This seems like the best next guess.

Guess 2: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)
Guess 3: NERVE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(-) R(-) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me summarize the constraints we have after three guesses.

Guess 1: SLATE → S, L, A, T are not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Guess 2: HONEY → H, O, Y are not in the word (x), N is in the word but not in position 3 (-), E is in position 4 (✓).

Guess 3: NERVE → N is in the word but not in position 1 (-), E is in the word but not in position 2 (-), R is in the word but not in position 3 (-), V is not in the word (x), E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Summary of constraints:
- E is in the word, and from HONEY we know it must be in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- N is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from NERVE it can't be in 1, from HONEY it can't be in 3, and position 2 would have been marked ✓ if correct). So N must be in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from NERVE it's not in 3, and position 4 is E). So R must be in position 1.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V.
- We have positions 1, 2, 3 to fill, with position 4 = E and position 5 = N.

So far we have: R _ _ E N

Letters we've used so far: R, E, N
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, Y, V
Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need to find a valid 5-letter word in the form R _ _ E N. Let's think of possible candidates:

- R I P E N - ""rip"" + ""en"" = ""ripen"" (a valid word)
- R A M E N - but A is banned
- R U M E N - ""rumen"" (also valid, but less common)
- R O D E N - O is banned
- R U D E N - not a valid word

""RIPEN"" seems to be the best candidate here:
- R in position 1 (matches our deduction)
- I, P in positions 2,3 (new letters, not banned)
- E in position 4 (matches confirmation)
- N in position 5 (matches our deduction)
- No banned letters are used

Let's verify:
- Letters used: R, I, P, E, N - none are in the banned list
- Position constraints: N is in 5 (allowed), E is in 4 (confirmed), R is in 1 (allowed)
- Word is valid 5-letter English word

This appears to be the correct guess.Based on the constraints derived from previous feedback, the only valid word that fits is:

   - R (cannot be positions 2, 3, 4 → must be position 1 or 5, but 5 is taken by N? Wait.)

Wait — let’s carefully list the “-” feedback for every letter that is “in the word but wrong position”.

From Guess 2 (HONEY): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 3.
From Guess 3 (NERVE): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 1.
From Guess 4 (RIPEN): N(-) means N is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore N cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Position 4 is already E, so N must be in position 2.

Similarly for R:

From Guess 4 (RIPEN): R(-) means R is in the word but not at position 1.

Let’s distill the feedback from all five guesses into a single set of constraints.

Positions 1 2 3 4 5  
Known:                       ?  ?  ?  E  ?

Letters confirmed in the word (at least once):
- E (must be in position 4)
- N (present, but wrong position every time it was tried: positions 1, 2, 3, 5)
- R (present, but wrong position every time it was tried: positions 1, 3, 5)

Therefore the only remaining free positions for N and R are:

N: must be in position 3 (already excluded 1,2,4,5)
R: must be in position 5 (already excluded 1,3,4)

So the pattern is now locked at:  ?  ?  N  E  R

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word (received x):
S L A T H O Y V P

Letters that are **allowed** for positions 1 and 2 (cannot repeat any of the excluded letters and must form a valid 5-letter word):

We need a valid word of the form _ _ N E R.

Listing common English words of that pattern:

- C I N E R  … no (cinch but not ciner)
- B I N E R  … no
- D I N E R  … already tested, N was wrong place
- G I N E R  … no
- W I N E R  … no
- F I N E R  … already tested, R was right place but I and F wrong places
- B U N E R  … no
- M I N E R  … already tested, N wrong place
- T U N E R  … T banned
- G U N N E R  … too long
- C O N N E R  … O banned
- K N I V E R  … K, V, I possible? But V is banned.
- D W I N E R  … uncommon

Wait, only real pattern matches are:
- DINER  (tested)
- FINER  (tested)
- MINER  (tested)
- WINER  (tested)
- GINER  (not common)

But all those have been tried or share letters already disqualified.

Let’s systematically list every remaining single-letter option for positions 1 and 2.

Allowed letters (not in banned list) for positions 1 and 2:
B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z (but excluding already used letters in fixed positions)

Letters already used in word: N, E, R (so cannot repeat them).

So possible pairs for positions 1-2:

- B I
- B U
- C I
- C U
- D I
- D U
- F I
- F U
- G I
- G U
- K I
- K U
- M I
- M U
- Q I
- Q U
- U I

Check which of these form valid English 5-letter words ending in NER:

- BINER → not valid
- BUNER → not valid
- CINER → no
- CUNER → no
- DINER → already tested
- DUNER → no
- FINER → already tested
- FUNER → no
- GINER → not common
- GUNER → no
- KINER → no
- KUNER → no
- MINER → already tested
- MUNER → no
- QINER → no
- QUNER → no
- UINER → no

None of these are valid 5-letter words except the ones we have already tried.

But we know the word exists (since the puzzle is solvable), so we must have missed something.

Ah! We assumed N had to be in position 3 and R in position 5, but let’s double-check:

- N has received “-” in positions 1,2,3,5: so N **must** be in 4? No, 4 is E. So N has no valid placement left. This is impossible.

Wait, let me re-examine feedback:

From RIPEN feedback: N(-) means N is in word but not in its current spot (position 4). But E is already in position 4, so N(-) in RIPEN’s position 4 is actually redundant — it already couldn’t be there. The real restriction from RIPEN is only that N is not in position 4 (which we already knew). So N could still be in position 2.

Similarly, let’s re-interpret R placements:

R has received:
- R(-) in NERVE (position 3), so R is not in 3.
- R(-) in RIPEN (position 1), so R is not in 1.
- R(✓) in FINER (position 5), so R is confirmed correct in 5.

E is confirmed in 4.

So the locked positions are:
? ? ? E R

Now N has restrictions:
- not in 1 (NERVE)
- not in 3 (HONEY)
- not in 4 (E)
- not in 5 (R)
So N **must** be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is:
? N ? E R

Now we need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ N _ E R.

Common words:
- UNDER
- ANGER
- INNER
- ONCER … but O banned
- UNGER … no
- B N I E R  … no

Looking at remaining allowed letters:

Letters not banned: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z  
Letters already placed: N(2), E(4), R(5)  
So positions 1 and 3 must be from remaining letters.

Valid 5-letter words matching _ N _ E R:

- B N E E R  … not valid
- C N I E R  … not valid
- D N I E R  … no
- G N A T E R  … A banned
- G N I E R  … no
- I N N E R  … N already used in 2, cannot repeat
- U N D E R  … D allowed, U allowed
- U N I E R  … no
- W N I E R  … no
- Z N I E R  … no

Only valid word found is UNDER.

Check UNDER:
- U (allowed, not banned)
- N (position 2, satisfies all N restrictions)
- D (allowed, not banned)
- E (position 4, correct)
- R (position 5, correct)

No banned letters used.

Thus UNDER fits every constraint.
