For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems optimal because:
- Contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters
- Covers 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good balance of vowels and consonants

This should give me valuable information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So far we know:
- The letters A and S are completely absent.
- The letters R, I, and E are all present somewhere, but not in the positions they occupied in ""RAISE"":
  – R cannot be first
  – I cannot be third
  – E cannot be fifth

Goal for the next guess:
1. Use R, I, and E in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
2. Avoid A and S.
3. Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

A good structure candidate: place R, I, and E in different positions and try common consonants like T, N, L, or D.  
Example candidates:
- TRIPE (but E is still last, same as before – bad)  
- IRATE (but I is first, E is last – both are same positions as feedback showed – bad)  
- INERT (I is second, E is fourth, R is fifth – none match the forbidden positions)  

""INERT"" fits well:

- N (new letter)

Known so far:

Letters fixed:
- I in position 1
- N in position 2

Letters that must appear somewhere (but we don’t yet know the exact spots):
- E  (cannot be 3, 4, or 5 – because it was rejected in those positions in earlier guesses)
- R  (cannot be 1, 5, or 4 – rejected in those spots)

Therefore:
- E can only go in position 3, because 1 and 2 are taken by I and N, and 4 & 5 have already been shown wrong for E.
- R can go in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is now the only open slot for E, so R must go in position 4.

This forces the word pattern:
I N E R _

The only blank left is position 5.  It must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out:
- Already excluded letters: A, S, T, U
- Allowed letters (common): B, C, D, G, L, M, P, etc.

A common 5-letter word fitting I N E R _ is “INERM” – but that isn’t a valid word.  
“INERT” was already tried.  
The real word matching this pattern and letter set is “INNER” (but it repeats N, which we have no evidence for).  
Wait – let me list real words:  
Valid English 5-letter words beginning with “INER”:
- INERM – not a word
- INERT – already guessed
- INEER – not a word
- INERS – contains S (already ruled out)

Actually, the only common dictionary word that fits the forced pattern is “INNER” (double N).  
We have no evidence against the second N, and it’s a legitimate word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems optimal because:
- Contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters
- Covers 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good balance of vowels and consonants

This should give me valuable information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me analyze the feedback from ""RAISE"":

R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So far we know:
- The letters A and S are completely absent.
- The letters R, I, and E are all present somewhere, but not in the positions they occupied in ""RAISE"":
  – R cannot be first
  – I cannot be third
  – E cannot be fifth

Goal for the next guess:
1. Use R, I, and E in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
2. Avoid A and S.
3. Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

A good structure candidate: place R, I, and E in different positions and try common consonants like T, N, L, or D.  
Example candidates:
- TRIPE (but E is still last, same as before – bad)  
- IRATE (but I is first, E is last – both are same positions as feedback showed – bad)  
- INERT (I is second, E is fourth, R is fifth – none match the forbidden positions)  

""INERT"" fits well:
- I (position 1 – allowed, since position 3 was forbidden)  
- N (new letter)  
- E (position 4 – new position)  
- R (position 5 – new position)  
- T (new letter)  

No S or A, all new positions for R, I, E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are **in the word** (and their current constraints):
- I – now fixed in position 1 (✓)
- N – now fixed in position 2 (✓)
- E – appears somewhere but NOT in position 3 (from Guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from Guess 2)
- R – appears somewhere but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1)

Letters **NOT in the word**: A, S, T

So the word shape so far is:
I N _ _ _

with the remaining letters needing to include E and R in their allowed positions, plus one more letter that isn’t A, S, or T.

Positions still open: 3, 4, 5
Allowed positions for E: 2 or 5 (but 2 is already N), so only 5 is left for E.
Allowed positions for R: 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is N), so 3 or 4.

Hence, possible word structures:
- I N R _ E  (R in 3, E in 5)
- I N _ R E  (R in 4, E in 5)

The blank must be a letter not yet used and not A/S/T. Common choices: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick “INURE”.  
It satisfies:
- I N _ U R E → structure I N _ R E (R in 4, E in 5)
- U is a new vowel that hasn’t been tested.
