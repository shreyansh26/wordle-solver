I need to make my first 5-letter word guess for Wordle. Since this is the first guess, I have no previous information to work with. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include multiple vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present
3. Use letters that can form many different words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of common letters to start with.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Exclude letters: A, O, S
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 5

   - Exclude letters: I, N, T
   - E is in word but not in position 3
   - R is in word but not in position 4

3. CREEK → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) K(x)
   - Exclude letters: C, K
   - 4th position is correct (E)
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 3 (and we now know 4th is fixed E)

So the secret word:
- Definitely has structure: _ _ _ E _
- Letters we know are present: R, E
- Letters we know are absent: A, C, I, K, N, O, S, T
- Allowed letters left: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4)
- Second E must appear somewhere (since 4th is E, and we know E is present, but not in position 3 or 5)

Wait: the 4th letter is E, and we already know E is in the word, but it must appear again (because the feedback for E in CREEK is “-” for positions 2 and 3, but “✓” for position 4). This tells us:
- There are at least two E’s, one in position 4, and one elsewhere (positions 1 or 2 or 5).

But we also know:
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from previous feedback).
- So the second E must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word has one of these patterns:
- E _ _ E _  (E in 1st and 4th positions)
- _ E _ E _  (E in 2nd and 4th positions)

We also know R must appear exactly once, in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 1st and 5th are possible depending on where the second E is).

Let’s enumerate possibilities based on these constraints:

Case 1: E _ _ E _
   - R must be in 3rd or 5th position.
   - 2nd and 3rd letters must be from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Case 2: _ E _ E _
   - R must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.
   - But 5th is allowed for R, but 1st and 3rd are also allowed.
   - However, 5th is not allowed for E, but is allowed for R.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting:
- E _ R E _ or E R _ E _ or _ E R E _ or _ E _ E R

From a quick scan of common words:
- VERVE (but V appears twice, and we have no info on V)
- MERGE (but G is allowed, M is allowed, R fits)
- PERVE (but V is allowed, P is allowed)
- HERVE (but H is allowed)
- FERME (but M is allowed)
- BERRY (but R appears twice, which may or may not be allowed)
- DERBY (but B is allowed, Y is allowed, R in 4th is forbidden)
- PERKY (but K is excluded)
- JERKY (K excluded)
- MERGE seems the best fit: M E R G E

   - Structure: _ E R E _ → E in 2nd and 4th, R in 3rd (allowed), no forbidden letters
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must have an E in position 4 and another E in position 1 or 2, and must include R somewhere not in positions 2 or 4. The only valid placement for R in a _ E _ E _ pattern is position 3. 

A valid word with this exact structure is not immediately obvious, but ""MERGE"" fits:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include multiple vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present
3. Use letters that can form many different words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of common letters to start with.

- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (somewhere)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- E cannot be in position 5
- R cannot be in position 2

Common letters left to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

I need a word with:
- R and E
- No A, O, S
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5

Good candidates: TREND, URINE, INERT, CRIER, ENTER, etc.

""TREND"" looks good:
- Uses T, R, E, N, D
- R is in position 2 (which I know is wrong from feedback), so skip

""INERT"":
- Uses I, N, E, R, T
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Valid remaining letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word with:

- R not in positions 2 or 4
- E not in positions 3 or 5

3. CREEK → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) K(x)  (E fixed in position 4)  
4. MERGE → M(x) E(-) R(-) G(x) E(-)  

Key deductions  
- Forbidden letters: A, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, S, T  
- Present letters: R and (at least one) E  
- E is locked into position 4: _ _ _ E _  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from R(-) in guesses 1, 3, 4)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- E may appear again elsewhere, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guess 2 and 4).  
  So if there is a second E it must be in position 1, but that would clash with R if R is also in position 1.  
  Therefore the word has exactly one E (position 4) and no other Es.

Pattern so far:  
- For R in position 1: R _ _ E _  
- For R in position 5: _ _ _ E R  

Allowed letters (unused & not forbidden):  
B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Candidate words  
- Position 1 R: R _ _ E _  
  e.g., R U B E L, R U P E L, R U F E L – none are valid English words.  
  The only common 5-letter word is R U B E L is invalid; R U B E L is not a word.  
  R U P E L is not a word.  
  R U F E L is not a word.  

- Position 5 R: _ _ _ E R  
  Common English word: U L C E R (L is allowed), but U is allowed.  
  But we have no info on U or L, and no forbidden letters.  
  D R E E R has two Es, which we have disallowed.  
  F U E L R is invalid.  

  Another candidate: F L E E R – but F L E E R has two Es.  
  V E T E R – V is allowed, but T is excluded.  

  P U R E R – P, U, R, E, R – but has two Rs, and the word is PURER.  
  But we don’t know if two Rs are allowed.  

  H E L P E R – too long.  

  B E A V E R – A is excluded.  

  D R E E R – two Es.  

  The only valid word left is ULCER: U L C E R.  
  C is excluded from forbidden letters – C was forbidden in guess 3.  
  So ULCER is invalid.  

Re-checking:  
From allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Let’s try positions:  
For R in position 1: R _ _ E _  
Possible combinations with allowed letters:  
R U P E D – but P, U, E, D are allowed. R U P E D is not a word.  
R U B E D – not a word.  
R U F E D – not a word.  

For R in position 5: _ _ _ E R  
Possible combinations:  
B U L E R – not a word.  
D U L E R – not a word.  
F U L E R – not a word.  
H U L E R – not a word.  
P U L E R – not a word.  
V U L E R – not a word.  
J U L E R – not a word.  
W U L E R – not a word.  

The only valid word that fits: U L C E R – but C is excluded.  

Another candidate: R U B E D – invalid.  

Wait, R U B E D is invalid. Let me re-examine.  

Realizing that the pattern is _ _ _ E R and R is allowed in position 5, the only common word left is D R U P E – but D, R, U, P, E – but R is allowed in position 5.  

Actually, for position 5 R:  
F U S E R – S is excluded.  
P U R E R – P U R E R – has two Rs, but P U R E R is a valid word.  

But we don’t know if two Rs are allowed.  

Another candidate: R U P E R – but R is in position 1 and 5, which is unlikely.  

The most plausible word is F U R E R – but F, U, R, E, R – two Rs.  

Actually, the only valid word left seems to be P U R E R.  

But let me check if there are other words.  

Another word: R E F E R – but this has E in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.  

But E in position 2 was marked with (-) in guess 4 MERGE, so E cannot be in position 2.  

Another word: V E R G E – G is excluded.  

Finally, the only valid word left is P U R E R.  

Let me verify:  
P U R E R  
- P: allowed  
- U: allowed  
- R: allowed, not in positions 2, 3, 4  
- E: allowed, must be in position 4 (fixed)  
- R: allowed in position 5  

The word P U R E R is a valid 5-letter English word.  

So the next guess is P U R E R.  

<think>
I have now deduced the exact constraints:

1. The word must be 5 letters.
2. Position 4 is E (✓ from CREEK).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, S, T.
4. Letters that ARE in the word: R (and exactly one E at position 4).
5. R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from previous R(-) feedback).
   → Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.
6. Only one E exists (at position 4), because a second E would have to be in position 1 or 2, but:
   - Position 2 was marked E(-) in MERGE → E not at position 2.
   - Position 1 would make the word E _ _ E R, but no valid English word fits with allowed letters.

Thus the word must be _ _ _ E R or R _ _ E _.

Allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English word fitting: P U R E R.

- P (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- R (allowed, not in positions 2-4)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>I need to make my first 5-letter word guess for Wordle. Since this is the first guess, I have no previous information to work with. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include multiple vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present
3. Use letters that can form many different words

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

Some popular strong starting words are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of common letters to start with.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (somewhere)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- E cannot be in position 5
- R cannot be in position 2

Common letters left to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

I need a word with:
- R and E
- No A, O, S
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5

Good candidates: TREND, URINE, INERT, CRIER, ENTER, etc.

""TREND"" looks good:
- Uses T, R, E, N, D
- R is in position 2 (which I know is wrong from feedback), so skip

""INERT"":
- Uses I, N, E, R, T
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters

Let's try INERT.

Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (INERT):
- I, N, T are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 4.

Combining:
- Letters NOT present: A, I, N, O, S, T
- Present letters: R (positions 1, 3, or 5 only), E (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 only)

Valid remaining letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word with:
- R and E
- R not in positions 2 or 4
- E not in positions 3 or 5
- No A, I, N, O, S, T

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ _ _ : Then E must be in 2, 3, or 4
- _ _ R _ _ : Then E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4
- _ _ _ _ R : Then E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Good candidates: CREEK, FRESH, BERRY, PERKY, etc.

Let's check:
- CREEK: Valid letters, positions, no forbidden letters. E is allowed in position 2, R in 3.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Exclude letters: A, O, S
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 5

2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
   - Exclude letters: I, N, T
   - E is in word but not in position 3
   - R is in word but not in position 4

3. CREEK → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) K(x)
   - Exclude letters: C, K
   - 4th position is correct (E)
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 3 (and we now know 4th is fixed E)

So the secret word:
- Definitely has structure: _ _ _ E _
- Letters we know are present: R, E
- Letters we know are absent: A, C, I, K, N, O, S, T
- Allowed letters left: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4)
- Second E must appear somewhere (since 4th is E, and we know E is present, but not in position 3 or 5)

Wait: the 4th letter is E, and we already know E is in the word, but it must appear again (because the feedback for E in CREEK is “-” for positions 2 and 3, but “✓” for position 4). This tells us:
- There are at least two E’s, one in position 4, and one elsewhere (positions 1 or 2 or 5).

But we also know:
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from previous feedback).
- So the second E must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word has one of these patterns:
- E _ _ E _  (E in 1st and 4th positions)
- _ E _ E _  (E in 2nd and 4th positions)

We also know R must appear exactly once, in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 1st and 5th are possible depending on where the second E is).

Let’s enumerate possibilities based on these constraints:

Case 1: E _ _ E _
   - R must be in 3rd or 5th position.
   - 2nd and 3rd letters must be from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Case 2: _ E _ E _
   - R must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.
   - But 5th is allowed for R, but 1st and 3rd are also allowed.
   - However, 5th is not allowed for E, but is allowed for R.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting:
- E _ R E _ or E R _ E _ or _ E R E _ or _ E _ E R

From a quick scan of common words:
- VERVE (but V appears twice, and we have no info on V)
- MERGE (but G is allowed, M is allowed, R fits)
- PERVE (but V is allowed, P is allowed)
- HERVE (but H is allowed)
- FERME (but M is allowed)
- BERRY (but R appears twice, which may or may not be allowed)
- DERBY (but B is allowed, Y is allowed, R in 4th is forbidden)
- PERKY (but K is excluded)
- JERKY (K excluded)
- MERGE seems the best fit: M E R G E
   - Letters: M (allowed), E (allowed), R (allowed), G (allowed), E (allowed)
   - Structure: _ E R E _ → E in 2nd and 4th, R in 3rd (allowed), no forbidden lettersBased on the feedback, the word must have an E in position 4 and another E in position 1 or 2, and must include R somewhere not in positions 2 or 4. The only valid placement for R in a _ E _ E _ pattern is position 3. 

A valid word with this exact structure is not immediately obvious, but ""MERGE"" fits:
- M (allowed)
- E (must be in position 2)
- R (must be in position 3)
- E (must be in position 4)
- G (allowed)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(-)
Guess 3: CREEK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) K(x)
Guess 4: MERGE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) G(x) E(-)

Guesses so far  
1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)  
3. CREEK → C(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) K(x)  (E fixed in position 4)  
4. MERGE → M(x) E(-) R(-) G(x) E(-)  

Key deductions  
- Forbidden letters: A, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, S, T  
- Present letters: R and (at least one) E  
- E is locked into position 4: _ _ _ E _  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from R(-) in guesses 1, 3, 4)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- E may appear again elsewhere, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guess 2 and 4).  
  So if there is a second E it must be in position 1, but that would clash with R if R is also in position 1.  
  Therefore the word has exactly one E (position 4) and no other Es.

Pattern so far:  
- For R in position 1: R _ _ E _  
- For R in position 5: _ _ _ E R  

Allowed letters (unused & not forbidden):  
B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Candidate words  
- Position 1 R: R _ _ E _  
  e.g., R U B E L, R U P E L, R U F E L – none are valid English words.  
  The only common 5-letter word is R U B E L is invalid; R U B E L is not a word.  
  R U P E L is not a word.  
  R U F E L is not a word.  

- Position 5 R: _ _ _ E R  
  Common English word: U L C E R (L is allowed), but U is allowed.  
  But we have no info on U or L, and no forbidden letters.  
  D R E E R has two Es, which we have disallowed.  
  F U E L R is invalid.  

  Another candidate: F L E E R – but F L E E R has two Es.  
  V E T E R – V is allowed, but T is excluded.  

  P U R E R – P, U, R, E, R – but has two Rs, and the word is PURER.  
  But we don’t know if two Rs are allowed.  

  H E L P E R – too long.  

  B E A V E R – A is excluded.  

  D R E E R – two Es.  

  The only valid word left is ULCER: U L C E R.  
  C is excluded from forbidden letters – C was forbidden in guess 3.  
  So ULCER is invalid.  

Re-checking:  
From allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Let’s try positions:  
For R in position 1: R _ _ E _  
Possible combinations with allowed letters:  
R U P E D – but P, U, E, D are allowed. R U P E D is not a word.  
R U B E D – not a word.  
R U F E D – not a word.  

For R in position 5: _ _ _ E R  
Possible combinations:  
B U L E R – not a word.  
D U L E R – not a word.  
F U L E R – not a word.  
H U L E R – not a word.  
P U L E R – not a word.  
V U L E R – not a word.  
J U L E R – not a word.  
W U L E R – not a word.  

The only valid word that fits: U L C E R – but C is excluded.  

Another candidate: R U B E D – invalid.  

Wait, R U B E D is invalid. Let me re-examine.  

Realizing that the pattern is _ _ _ E R and R is allowed in position 5, the only common word left is D R U P E – but D, R, U, P, E – but R is allowed in position 5.  

Actually, for position 5 R:  
F U S E R – S is excluded.  
P U R E R – P U R E R – has two Rs, but P U R E R is a valid word.  

But we don’t know if two Rs are allowed.  

Another candidate: R U P E R – but R is in position 1 and 5, which is unlikely.  

The most plausible word is F U R E R – but F, U, R, E, R – two Rs.  

Actually, the only valid word left seems to be P U R E R.  

But let me check if there are other words.  

Another word: R E F E R – but this has E in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.  

But E in position 2 was marked with (-) in guess 4 MERGE, so E cannot be in position 2.  

Another word: V E R G E – G is excluded.  

Finally, the only valid word left is P U R E R.  

Let me verify:  
P U R E R  
- P: allowed  
- U: allowed  
- R: allowed, not in positions 2, 3, 4  
- E: allowed, must be in position 4 (fixed)  
- R: allowed in position 5  

The word P U R E R is a valid 5-letter English word.  

So the next guess is P U R E R.  

<think>
I have now deduced the exact constraints:

1. The word must be 5 letters.
2. Position 4 is E (✓ from CREEK).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, S, T.
4. Letters that ARE in the word: R (and exactly one E at position 4).
5. R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from previous R(-) feedback).
   → Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.
6. Only one E exists (at position 4), because a second E would have to be in position 1 or 2, but:
   - Position 2 was marked E(-) in MERGE → E not at position 2.
   - Position 1 would make the word E _ _ E R, but no valid English word fits with allowed letters.

Thus the word must be _ _ _ E R or R _ _ E _.

Allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English word fitting: P U R E R.

- P (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- R (allowed, not in positions 2-4)
- E (fixed at 4)
- R (allowed in 5)

This is the only common word left.

Let’s consolidate what Guess 5 now tells us:

PURER → P(x) U(x) R(-) E(✓) R(✓)

- P and U are NOT in the word.
- R is NOT in position 3 (we already knew it couldn’t be in 2, 3 or 4).
- E is correct in position 4.
- R is correct in position 5.

Hence the word ends in “…E R” and the letter R is now fixed in position 5 (✓).  
So the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and we already have:

Letters already fixed:
- position 4 = E
- position 5 = R

Letters still unknown:
- positions 1, 2, 3

Letters that have been eliminated so far (from all guesses):
A, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, S, T, U

Allowed letters left (not yet tried or ruled out):
B, D, F, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-used E and R which are correct).

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? ? ? E R that uses only the allowed letters.

Scanning English words that fit _ _ _ E R:

B – L – E – E – R → BLEER (not a word)  
B – O – W – E – R → BOWER (O eliminated)  
B – U – Y – E – R → BUYER (U eliminated)  
D – I – V – E – R → DIVER (I eliminated)  
D – R – I – V – E – R → too long  
F – E – V – E – R → FEVER (E already in 4)  
F – L – E – E – R → FLEER (has two Es, but we only have one E)  
H – E – L – V – E – R → HELVER (V is allowed) but we need 5 letters  
H – U – V – E – R → HUVER? (not a word)  
L – E – V – E – R → LEVER (two Es)  
L – U – V – E – R → LUVER (U eliminated)  
D – E – B – E – R → DEBER (not standard)  
F – I – B – E – R → FIBER (I eliminated)  
D – O – V – E – R → DOVER (O eliminated)  
J – U – V – E – R → JUVER (U eliminated)  
V – I – V – E – R → VIVER (I eliminated)  
L – I – V – E – R → LIVER (I eliminated)  
B – I – V – E – R → BIVER (I eliminated)  
F – I – V – E – R → FIVER (I eliminated)  

The first valid common word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is:

F – E – V – E – R → FEVER

Check:
- F (never tried, allowed)
- E (already correct in 4)
- V (never tried, allowed)
- E (already correct in 4)
- R (correct in 5)

No forbidden letters, single E at 4, R at 5, positions 1-2-3 use only F, E, V.

So FEVER is the next logical guess.
