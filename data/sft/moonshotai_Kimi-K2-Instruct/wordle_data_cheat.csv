For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in the English language. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for either finding correct letters or eliminating many possibilities early on.

Summarizing what we know after both guesses:

From AROSE:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

From BEACH:
- B is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3.
- C is in the word, but not in position 4.
- H is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far:
Mandatory letters: A, C, E, H  
Forbidden letters: B, O, R, S  
Positions we now know to avoid:
- A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
- C cannot be 4th.
- E cannot be 2nd or 5th.
- H cannot be 5th.

We still need a 5-letter word that contains A, C, E, H and one additional letter that is none of B, O, R, S.  
The most common un-tested remaining letters are D, G, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.  
Let’s list possible English words meeting these constraints.

Candidate words that use A, C, E, H plus one new letter:
- CHAFE (C, H, A, F, E) – but F hasn’t been tested yet.
- CHEAP (C, H, E, A, P) – P hasn’t been tested.
- LEACH (L, E, A, C, H) – L hasn’t been tested.
- PEACH (P, E, A, C, H) – P hasn’t been tested.
- TEACH (T, E, A, C, H) – T hasn’t been tested.

Among these, LEACH uses the new letter L, which is common and hasn’t been ruled out, and it places the known letters in fresh positions.

- L is new.
- E is in position 2 (but we know E cannot be in position 2 from BEACH feedback).  
Oops! E cannot be in position 2, but in LEACH, E is in position 2 – so that’s invalid.

Next, let’s check TEACH:
- T is new.
- E is in position 2 – again invalid.

PEACH:
- P is new.
- E is in position 2 – invalid.

CHEAP:
- C, H, E, A, P
- E is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), H in 2 (allowed).  
This fits all constraints: C is not in 4, E is not in 2 or 5, A is not in 1 or 3, H is not in 5, and no forbidden letters are used.

So CHEAP is a valid next guess.

- L is new.
- E is in position 2 (but we know E cannot be in position 2 from BEACH feedback).  
Oops! E cannot be in position 2, but in LEACH, E is in position 2 – so that’s invalid.

Next, let’s check TEACH:
- T is new.
- E is in position 2 – again invalid.

PEACH:
- P is new.
- E is in position 2 – invalid.

CHEAP:
- C, H, E, A, P
- E is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), H in 2 (allowed).  
This fits all constraints: C is not in 4, E is not in 2 or 5, A is not in 1 or 3, H is not in 5, and no forbidden letters are used.

So CHEAP is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on CHEAP:
- C(✓) – C is in the word and in the correct first position.
- H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct second position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct third position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct fourth position.
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.

So the word so far is:
C H E A _

We know:
- Forbidden letters (from earlier turns): B, O, R, S, P  
- Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, G, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y

We need a single letter to fit in the 5th position that is:
- 5-letter English word starting with CHEA, ending with that letter
- Not any of the forbidden letters

Looking at valid English words:
- CHEAT – T is allowed, not forbidden
- CHEAK – obsolete spelling, not standard
- CHEAP – already guessed, P is forbidden
- CHEAS – not a standard word
- CHEAR – archaic spelling, R is forbidden
- CHEAM – not a standard word
- CHEAH – not a standard word

The only standard English word left is CHEAT, using T (which hasn't been ruled out).

So the word must be CHEAT.
