For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information by covering common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these common letters to maximize our chances of getting hits.

Looking at these letters, possible good starting words could be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters and gives us good coverage of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E. Between these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers more of the top 10 most frequent letters in English.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → is in the word but in wrong position
- A: - → is in the word but in wrong position
- N: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, N, or E
- DOES contain R and A
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3

For my second guess I want to:
1. Preserve the known letters R and A
2. Place R and A in new positions
3. Introduce new common letters that weren't tested yet (we've eliminated C, N, E)

Good remaining common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, P, M, B, etc.

Possible words:
- TRIAL (but we already excluded E, and I is common)
- ROAST (but we know O wasn't used yet - might be good)
- TRASH (T, R, A, S, H)
- RATIO (but we don't know about O or I yet)

Looking at these, ""TRASH"" uses T, R, A, S, H - all new letters except R and A which we know are present. This gives us good coverage and places R in position 2 (new position) and A in position 3 (also new position).

But wait, we know A is not in position 3 from CRANE feedback. So TRASH is invalid.

Let's try words where:
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3
- No C, N, E

Possible options:
- RAILS (R, A, I, L, S) - R in 1, A in 2
- RATIO (but O is untested)
- ROAST (O in 2, A in 3 - but A can't be in 3)

I think ""RAILS"" is good - places R in 1, A in 2, and introduces I, L, S.
