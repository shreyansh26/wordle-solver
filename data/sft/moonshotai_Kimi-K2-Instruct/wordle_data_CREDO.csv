1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many possible secret words. The most effective starting words usually contain a good mix of vowels and common consonants.

Some of the most statistically optimal starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE
- SOARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of possible letters and positions in the English language. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Known so far:

- S, L, A, T are ruled out entirely.

I need a fresh set of letters that does not include S, L, A, or T, and which places E somewhere other than the last position. A good next-guess strategy is to try a word with entirely new common letters plus E in a new spot.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, G, B, F  
Common remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already in play)

Candidate word: CRONE
- Uses C, R, O, N, E
- None of the banned letters S, L, A, T
- Places E in position 5 is ruled out, so I’ll shift E to position 4.
- CRONE has E in position 4, which is allowed.

   - E is present somewhere but not in position 4 or 5
2. Letters known not to be in the word: S, L, A, T, N
3. O is in the word but not in position 3

So the pattern so far is:
C R ? ? ? with E required somewhere, O required somewhere (but not in position 3), and no S/L/A/T/N allowed.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 3 (but O must also be somewhere, and position 3 is excluded for O)
- Position 1: impossible (C fixed)
- Position 2: impossible (R fixed)
- Position 4: ruled out by last feedback
- Position 5: ruled out by first feedback

This suggests E must be in position 3, making the pattern: C R E ? ?

Now O must be in either position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 3).
