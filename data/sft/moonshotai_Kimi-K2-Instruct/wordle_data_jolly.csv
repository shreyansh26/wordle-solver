For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words include: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid English word

3. Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- L in position 4
- Only letters from remaining pool

Possible combinations:
- B O _ L _ → B O ? L ? (need 2 more letters)
- F O _ L _ → F O ? L ?

Looking at common English words:
- BOGLY (but G and Y are possible)

- H O _ L _ → H O ? L ?
- J O _ L _ → J O ? L ?

- M O _ L _ → M O ? L ?

Common words that fit:
- BOBBY (but B is repeated and Y is possible)
- BOGUS (but U and S are eliminated)
- HOLLY (but H is possible, O is correct, L is correct, but we need to check: pattern would be H O L L Y → but position 3 and 4 can't both be L, since we know only position 4 is L)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ L _, so positions are:
1: ?
2: O (fixed)
3: ?
4: L (fixed)
5: ?

So possible words:
- B O _ L _ → B O ? L ?

- H O _ L _ → H O ? L ?
- J O _ L _ → J O ? L ?

Looking at common words:
- BOGLY (B, O, G, L, Y) → all letters possible
- FOGGY (but G is repeated, and second G is position 4 which must be L)
- HOGGY (same issue)
- JOWLY (J, O, W, L, Y) → all letters possible
- KOLLY (but K is possible, but ""kolly"" isn't a word)
- MOLLY (M, O, L, L, Y) → but position 4 is L, position 3 would also be L - but we don't know if L can appear twice. However, ""molly"" has L in position 3 and 4, but we only know L is in position 4. So this might be risky.
- BOBBY (B, O, B, B, Y) → but we don't know about B yet, and multiple B's are possible.

Between BOGLY and JOWLY, ""BOGLY"" seems more likely as ""bogly"" is an adjective form related to ""bog"", though rare. ""Jowly"" is also a word.

But let's think of more common words:
- BOGGY (B, O, G, G, Y) but position 4 must be L, so this doesn't fit
- BOBBY (B, O, B, B, Y) → position 4 is B, but must be L - no
- BOFFO (but F is position 5, and O is already position 2)
- BOOZY (B, O, O, Z, Y) → position 4 is Z, but must be L - no

Actually, looking carefully, the pattern is _ O _ L _, so:
- 1st letter: any remaining (B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- 2nd letter: O
- 3rd letter: any remaining

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,jolly,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words include: ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid English word

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word
- R(x) – R is not in the word
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 3)
- S(x) – S is not in the word
- E(x) – E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains the letter O (but not in position 3)
- It does NOT contain A, R, S, or E
- Position 3 is NOT O

We need a word that:
1. Has the letter O somewhere other than position 3
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, S, E)
3. Uses common remaining consonants

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good candidates to test next: L, N, T, C, P, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be:
- Put O in position 1 or 2 to test its placement
- Use other common consonants and remaining vowels (I, U, Y)

I'll try ""POINT"":
- P and N are common consonants
- I is a common vowel we haven't tested yet
- T is another common consonant
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3)

Let's verify this fits all constraints:
- No A, R, S, or E
- Contains O
- O is not in position 3

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on POINT:

- P(x) – P is not in the word
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- N(x) – N is not in the word
- T(x) – T is not in the word

So we now know:
1. Position 2 is definitely O.
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T
3. Letters not yet tested (still possible): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
4. The word has the form: _ O _ _ _

Vowels left to consider: U, Y  
Consonants left to consider: many, but we want common ones. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, K.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Uses only letters not eliminated so far
- Uses common remaining letters

Good possibilities among common words:
- BOUGH (but we haven't tested G or H yet)
- BOUND (but we haven't tested D yet)
- COULD (but we haven't tested U, L, or D)
- GOULD (but we haven't tested G, U, L, D)

Let's think of common five-letter words with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters. Some options:
- BOUGH, COULD, FOUND, MOUND, WOULD, BOOBY, etc.

But we must avoid letters P, I, N, T, A, R, S, E.

Looking at this, ""COULD"" seems promising:
- C, O, U, L, D are all not yet eliminated
- Uses common letters
- O is in position 2 correctly

Let's check:
- C: not eliminated
- O: position 2 (correct)
- U: not eliminated
- L: not eliminated
- D: not eliminated

This fits all constraints.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ L _, so positions are:

- BOOZY (B, O, O, Z, Y) → position 4 is Z, but must be L - no

From the latest feedback on JOWLY:

- J(✓) – J is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- O(✓) – O is correct and in the correct position (position 2).
- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is correct and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) – Y is correct and in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know the exact pattern of the word: J O _ L Y

We need to determine the missing letter in position 3. From previous eliminations and confirmations:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, W
Letters confirmed in specific positions: J (pos1), O (pos2), L (pos4), Y (pos5)

Remaining possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, X, Z

Now, let's think of common 5-letter English words that fit the pattern J O _ L Y and use letters from the remaining pool.

Looking at the remaining letters:
- B: Could form J O B L Y
- F: Could form J O F L Y
- G: Could form J O G L Y
- H: Could form J O H L Y
- K: Could form J O K L Y
- M: Could form J O M L Y
- Q: No common word fits
- V: Could form J O V L Y
- X: No common word fits
- Z: Could form J O Z L Y

Now, checking which of these are actual English words:
- J O B L Y → ""jobly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O F L Y → ""jofly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O G L Y → ""jogly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O H L Y → ""johly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O K L Y → ""jokly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O M L Y → ""jomly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O V L Y → ""jovly"" is not a recognized English word
- J O Z L Y → ""jozly"" is not a recognized English word

This is concerning because none of these combinations form valid English words. This suggests I might have made an error in identifying valid words earlier or missed a possible letter. Let me re-examine the remaining possible letters more carefully.

Looking back at the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, X, Z

Actually, among these, the only one that forms a valid English word is ""JOLLY"" with the letter L in position 3. However, this would mean the word has two L's - one in position 3 and one in position 4. 

Given that:
1. We know L is in position 4
2. The word pattern is J O _ L Y
3. All other combinations with remaining letters don't form valid words
4. ""JOLLY"" is a valid 5-letter English word

This seems to be the only possible remaining word that fits all constraints. The feedback so far hasn't ruled out the possibility of the letter L appearing twice in the word.

Therefore, the correct word must be JOLLY.
