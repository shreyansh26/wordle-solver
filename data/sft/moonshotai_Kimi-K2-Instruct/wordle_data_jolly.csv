Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and frequently used consonants as possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

The word ""AROSE"" fits these criteria perfectly:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid English word

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for common English words matching _O_L_ with these constraints.

Candidate words:
- FOLLY (but Y is allowed, and all letters F, O, L, Y are allowed)
- GOLLY
- HOLLY (but H, O, L, Y are allowed)
- MOLLY
- POLLY (but P is eliminated)
- WOLLY (not a common word)
- FOLLY seems best.

Check FOLLY:
Letters: F, O, L, L, Y
- F is allowed
- O is in position 2 (correct)
- L is in position 4 (correct)
- Second L is in position 3 – but we don't know if L is allowed to repeat. Since position 4 is confirmed L, and we have no info about other L's, this is acceptable.
- Y is allowed

Thus, FOLLY is a valid guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Guess 3: COULD -> C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(✓) D(x)

1. C(x) – C is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is confirmed in position 2 (already known).
3. U(x) – U is not in the word.
4. L(✓) – L is confirmed in position 4.
5. D(x) – D is not in the word.

Summary so far:

Letters eliminated (from any position):
A, E, I, R, S, P, N, T, C, U, D

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: L

Remaining letters to consider:
Consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: none left (A, E, I, O, U all used or eliminated)

The word structure is now: _ O _ L _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the remaining pool. Let's choose common letters and form a valid word.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for common English words matching _O_L_ with these constraints.

Candidate words:
- FOLLY (but Y is allowed, and all letters F, O, L, Y are allowed)
- GOLLY
- HOLLY (but H, O, L, Y are allowed)
- MOLLY
- POLLY (but P is eliminated)
- WOLLY (not a common word)
- FOLLY seems best.

Check FOLLY:
Letters: F, O, L, L, Y
- F is allowed
- O is in position 2 (correct)
- L is in position 4 (correct)
- Second L is in position 3 – but we don't know if L is allowed to repeat. Since position 4 is confirmed L, and we have no info about other L's, this is acceptable.
- Y is allowed

Thus, FOLLY is a valid guess.Now the pattern is _ O _ L _ with many letters eliminated. A good candidate that fits is:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: COULD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: FOLLY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from Guess 4 (FOLLY → F(x) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)) tells us:

1. F is not in the word.
2. O is in position 2 (already known).
3. L is in positions 3 and 4 (already known for position 4; now we also know it’s in position 3).
4. Y is in position 5.

So the exact pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown (but cannot be A, C, D, E, F, I, N, P, R, S, T, U)
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Letters still allowed for position 1: B, G, H, K, M, V, W, Z (and a few rarer ones).

The only common English word that matches the pattern _ O L L Y is:

BOLLY (but B is allowed and not yet eliminated)

All letters B, O, L, L, Y fit the current constraints.
