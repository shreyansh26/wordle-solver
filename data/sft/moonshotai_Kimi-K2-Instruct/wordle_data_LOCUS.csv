For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the secret word. This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain many of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to get feedback on as many different letters as possible. Popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters, making it an excellent first guess to maximize information gathering.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain many of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to get feedback on as many different letters as possible. Popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" covers five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters, making it an excellent first guess to maximize information gathering.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, E.
- Present letters: O (not in slot 3), S (not in slot 4).

We still have 5 unknown positions and need to test more high-frequency consonants and vowels. Good candidates to test now are I, N, T, L, U, C, D, P, etc. 

A strong second guess that uses S and O while avoiding the forbidden letters and positions is “POINT”. It introduces P, I, N, T and keeps O and S without reusing any of the eliminated letters or positions.

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from AROSE feedback: S(-)).

So the word looks like: _ O _ _ _
and S must appear in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be in position 4).

We have already eliminated a lot of common letters (A, R, E, P, I, N, T), so we now need to test the remaining high-frequency consonants and vowels: C, L, D, G, H, K, M, U, Y, etc.

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps O in position 2.
- Uses S in a new position (e.g., position 1 or 3).
- Tests several of the remaining letters.

A good candidate is “SOLID”. It uses S in position 1, tests L, D, and avoids all forbidden letters.

Looking for common words that fit _ O C _ S:

- FOCHS (not a word)  
- HOCHS (not a word)  
- GOCKS (not a word)  
- YOCKS (not a word)  
- BOCHS (not a word)  
- BOCES (not matching pattern)  

Actually, the only common word that perfectly matches _ O C _ S is FOCUS (but it's F O C U S, which would put U in position 4). However, we haven't tested U in position 4 yet, and U hasn't been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess should be FOCUS.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Position S in slot 3: _ O S _ _  
  e.g., “GOSHT”, “MOSKY”, “COUGH” – these use many new letters.
- Position S in slot 5: _ O _ _ S  
  e.g., “COUGS”, “FOGHS”, “MOCKS” – but we prefer real words.

Among those, “COUGS” isn’t valid; “MOCKS” is a known word and tests M, C, K.

Let’s go with “MOCKS”:
- M, C, K are all new high-frequency letters.
- S is in slot 5, a position it hasn’t been tried in yet.
- Completely respects all feedback so far.

So the next guess is:

<guess>MOCKS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) L(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 4: MOCKS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) C(✓) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating everything we know after four guesses:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, E, P, I, N, T, L, D, M, K

Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions (✓):  
- O in position 2  
- C in position 3  
- S in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ O C _ S  

Remaining unused letters from the alphabet (still possible):  
B, F, G, H, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Among these, the most common in 5-letter English words are B, F, G, H, U, Y.

We need a single letter to fill position 1 (the underscore) that makes a valid word with the pattern _ O C _ S.

Looking for common words that fit _ O C _ S:

- BOCKS (not a standard word)  
- FOCHS (not a word)  
- HOCHS (not a word)  
- GOCKS (not a word)  
- YOCKS (not a word)  
- BOCHS (not a word)  
- BOCES (not matching pattern)  

Actually, the only common word that perfectly matches _ O C _ S is FOCUS (but it's F O C U S, which would put U in position 4). However, we haven't tested U in position 4 yet, and U hasn't been ruled out.

But wait - looking again, the pattern is:  
Position 1: unknown  
Position 2: O (confirmed)  
Position 3: C (confirmed)  
Position 4: unknown  
Position 5: S (confirmed)  

Thus the word must be [?] O C [?] S.

A very likely candidate is FOCUS, which fits perfectly: F O C U S.

We haven't eliminated F or U yet, and this uses both new letters. This seems like the most probable word fitting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be FOCUS.
