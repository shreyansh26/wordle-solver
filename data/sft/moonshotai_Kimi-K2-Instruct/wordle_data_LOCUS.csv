For the first guess, we want a word that can help us efficiently gather information about common letters and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants and vowels that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Good coverage of common positions (start, middle, end)

Looking at common letter distributions in 5-letter words, some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it includes very common letters (R, A, S, E) plus the useful vowel I, and has good positional coverage.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Since we know S appears somewhere, the next guess should:
1. Include the confirmed letter S
2. Shift S to a new position (not 4)
3. Use entirely new letters (avoiding R, A, I, E)
4. Preferably test common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet

From Guess 3 (HOLYS) we now know:

- H is NOT in the word.  
- O is in position 2 (already known).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Y is NOT in the word.  
- S is in the word AND is in position 5.

So the current template looks like:

Position 1: ?  
Position 2: O  
Position 3: ?  
Position 4: ?  
Position 5: S  

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, U, N, D, H, Y.  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (fixed at 2), L (somewhere), S (fixed at 5).

Remaining good letters to try: T, C, M, P, G, B, F, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Has S in position 5.  
- Contains L somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Candidate words:
- CLOTS (C, L, O, T, S) – L in position 2? No, position 2 is fixed O. L is position 3.  
- BLOTS – B, L, O, T, S – L in position 2? No, 2 is O. So L in position 3.  
- PLOTS – P, L, O, T, S – same.  
- FLOSS – invalid (double S and double letters).  
- GLOBS – G, L, O, B, S – L in position 3.  
- BLOCS – B, L, O, C, S – L in position 3.

""BLOTS"" seems like a strong choice because:
- B is new.  
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since HOLYS only told us L is not in position 3? Wait, no: HOLYS feedback for L was ""in the word but wrong position"", and in HOLYS L was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to adjust. Let’s pick a word with L in position 1 or 4.

Examples:
- LOPES – L in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4 (but E is excluded), invalid.  
- LOWES – W is new, but E is excluded.  
- LOFTS – F in 3, T in 4, S in 5 – L in 1, O in 2 – valid letters (L, O, F, T, S).  
- LOCUS – U is excluded.  
- LOCKS – K is new, C is new – L in 1, O in 2, C in 3, K in 4, S in 5 – valid.

Between ""LOFTS"" and ""LOCKS"", ""LOCKS"" tests C and K which are fresh and common.

Thus, ""LOCKS"" is a good next guess:
- L in 1 (new position for L).  
- O in 2 (fixed).  
- C in 3 (new).  
- K in 4 (new).  
- S in 5 (fixed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can help us efficiently gather information about common letters and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants and vowels that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Good coverage of common positions (start, middle, end)

Looking at common letter distributions in 5-letter words, some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it includes very common letters (R, A, S, E) plus the useful vowel I, and has good positional coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Since we know S appears somewhere, the next guess should:
1. Include the confirmed letter S
2. Shift S to a new position (not 4)
3. Use entirely new letters (avoiding R, A, I, E)
4. Preferably test common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet

Good candidate consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good candidate vowels left: O, U, Y (sometimes)

Let’s pick a word that places S in position 1 and uses fresh letters: ""STOUT"" tests S, T, O, U.

But ""STOUT"" repeats T. A better choice is ""SOUND"" – it includes S in position 1, tests O, U, N, D, all new letters.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SOUND:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5).
- O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- U and N are NOT in the word.
- D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word contains S and O (with O in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, U, N, D.

Remaining good letters still untested: T, L, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains S (but not in position 1 or 4).
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A good next guess is ""POLYS"":
- P is new.
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- L is new.
- Y is new.
- S is in position 5 (new position for S, which is allowed).

Alternatively, ""MOLDS"" is invalid because D is excluded. ""COYOS"" has repeated O. ""HOLYS"" is better, but ""POLYS"" tests P which is quite common.

""FOSYL"" is not a valid word. ""HOLOS"" is invalid due to repeated O.

Thus, ""HOLYS"" is a good valid choice:
- H is new.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- L is new.
- Y is new.
- S in position 5.

Let’s pick ""HOLYS"".

We need to adjust. Let’s pick a word with L in position 1 or 4.

Examples:
- LOPES – L in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4 (but E is excluded), invalid.  
- LOWES – W is new, but E is excluded.  
- LOFTS – F in 3, T in 4, S in 5 – L in 1, O in 2 – valid letters (L, O, F, T, S).  
- LOCUS – U is excluded.  
- LOCKS – K is new, C is new – L in 1, O in 2, C in 3, K in 4, S in 5 – valid.

Between ""LOFTS"" and ""LOCKS"", ""LOCKS"" tests C and K which are fresh and common.

Thus, ""LOCKS"" is a good next guess:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LOCUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can help us efficiently gather information about common letters and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants and vowels that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Good coverage of common positions (start, middle, end)

Looking at common letter distributions in 5-letter words, some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it includes very common letters (R, A, S, E) plus the useful vowel I, and has good positional coverage.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Since we know S appears somewhere, the next guess should:
1. Include the confirmed letter S
2. Shift S to a new position (not 4)
3. Use entirely new letters (avoiding R, A, I, E)
4. Preferably test common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet

Good candidate consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good candidate vowels left: O, U, Y (sometimes)

Let’s pick a word that places S in position 1 and uses fresh letters: ""STOUT"" tests S, T, O, U.

But ""STOUT"" repeats T. A better choice is ""SOUND"" – it includes S in position 1, tests O, U, N, D, all new letters.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SOUND:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5).
- O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- U and N are NOT in the word.
- D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word contains S and O (with O in position 2).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, U, N, D.

Remaining good letters still untested: T, L, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains S (but not in position 1 or 4).
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A good next guess is ""POLYS"":
- P is new.
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- L is new.
- Y is new.
- S is in position 5 (new position for S, which is allowed).

Alternatively, ""MOLDS"" is invalid because D is excluded. ""COYOS"" has repeated O. ""HOLYS"" is better, but ""POLYS"" tests P which is quite common.

""FOSYL"" is not a valid word. ""HOLOS"" is invalid due to repeated O.

Thus, ""HOLYS"" is a good valid choice:
- H is new.
- O in position 2 (✓).
- L is new.
- Y is new.
- S in position 5.

Let’s pick ""HOLYS"".

<guess>HOLYS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: HOLYS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) L(-) Y(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 3 (HOLYS) we now know:

- H is NOT in the word.  
- O is in position 2 (already known).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Y is NOT in the word.  
- S is in the word AND is in position 5.

So the current template looks like:

Position 1: ?  
Position 2: O  
Position 3: ?  
Position 4: ?  
Position 5: S  

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, U, N, D, H, Y.  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (fixed at 2), L (somewhere), S (fixed at 5).

Remaining good letters to try: T, C, M, P, G, B, F, K.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Has S in position 5.  
- Contains L somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Candidate words:
- CLOTS (C, L, O, T, S) – L in position 2? No, position 2 is fixed O. L is position 3.  
- BLOTS – B, L, O, T, S – L in position 2? No, 2 is O. So L in position 3.  
- PLOTS – P, L, O, T, S – same.  
- FLOSS – invalid (double S and double letters).  
- GLOBS – G, L, O, B, S – L in position 3.  
- BLOCS – B, L, O, C, S – L in position 3.

""BLOTS"" seems like a strong choice because:
- B is new.  
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since HOLYS only told us L is not in position 3? Wait, no: HOLYS feedback for L was ""in the word but wrong position"", and in HOLYS L was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to adjust. Let’s pick a word with L in position 1 or 4.

Examples:
- LOPES – L in 1, O in 2, P in 3, E in 4 (but E is excluded), invalid.  
- LOWES – W is new, but E is excluded.  
- LOFTS – F in 3, T in 4, S in 5 – L in 1, O in 2 – valid letters (L, O, F, T, S).  
- LOCUS – U is excluded.  
- LOCKS – K is new, C is new – L in 1, O in 2, C in 3, K in 4, S in 5 – valid.

Between ""LOFTS"" and ""LOCKS"", ""LOCKS"" tests C and K which are fresh and common.

Thus, ""LOCKS"" is a good next guess:
- L in 1 (new position for L).  
- O in 2 (fixed).  
- C in 3 (new).  
- K in 4 (new).  
- S in 5 (fixed).

Letters already ruled out for the blank include: R, A, I, E, U, N, D, H, Y, K and any others already tried.

Remaining common consonants not yet used: B, F, G, M, P, T, W, etc.

The only plausible English 5-letter words that fit L O C _ S are:
