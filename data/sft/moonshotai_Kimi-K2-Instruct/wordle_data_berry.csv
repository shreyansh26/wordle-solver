For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. Words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLANT"" are popular choices among Wordle players. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it uses S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters, and it doesn't repeat any letters. This should give good coverage to help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E.
2. E is NOT in position 5.
3. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Popular letters remaining that haven't been eliminated: R, I, N, O, C, D, U, M, H, Y, etc.

A good strategy now is to pick a word that uses E in a different position and includes other common letters. Words like ""RINSE"", ""DINER"", ""OUNCE"", or ""MONEY"" fit. I'll choose ""RINSE"" because:
- It uses E in position 5 (which we know is wrong, but we need to test E in other positions)
- It includes R, I, N which are common
- Excludes eliminated letters S, L, A, T

Wait - ""RINSE"" uses S which we know is eliminated. Let me pick ""DINER"" instead:
- Uses D, I, N, E, R
- E is in position 4 (new position)
- All letters are still possible

Actually, E is in position 5 in ""DINER"" - same issue. Let me choose ""MONEY"":
- M, O, N, E, Y
- E is in position 4
- None of the eliminated letters are used

From the three clues:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ No S, L, A, T; E exists but not in position 5.

2. MONEY → M(x) O(x) N(x) E(-) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ No M, O, N; E exists but not in position 4; Y is correct in position 5.

3. PERKY → P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ No P, K; E is correct in position 2; R is correct in position 3; Y is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ E R _ Y

Forbidden letters accumulated: S, L, A, T, M, O, N, P, K.

We need a word that:
- Has length 5
- Matches pattern _ E R _ Y (positions 2,3,5 fixed as E,R,Y respectively)
- Contains no forbidden letters
- Uses valid English letters for positions 1 and 4 (only positions left to determine)

Possible remaining letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (among others, but focusing on common ones)

Let's list possible valid English words fitting _ E R _ Y:

- BERRY (but B is allowed, R is already in position 3, but Y is in position 5 - this would fit pattern wise, but we have R already in position 3, so this would be B E R R Y which has two R's. The feedback shows R is correct in position 3, so this is possible.)
- JERRY (but J is allowed, E R R Y)
- FERRY (F is allowed)
- HERRY (but not a valid word)
- DERRY (valid word: D E R R Y)

Looking at these, the most common and likely correct ones are BERRY, FERRY, or DERRY.

Between these, let's pick the one with the most common starting letter. B is very common, so let's try BERRY.

Wait, let's double-check:
- B: not forbidden
- E: correct in position 2
- R: correct in position 3
- R: second R should be allowed since we only know R is correct in position 3, not that it can't appear elsewhere
- Y: correct in position 5

BERRY seems valid.

But let's consider if there are single-letter options for position 4. Actually, position 4 must be a single letter, and the word must be _ E R _ Y. Other possibilities:

- CERVY (not a word)
- VERGY (not a word)
- WERDY (not a word)
- HERVY (not a word)
- GERVY (not a word)

It seems the only valid words are those with double R: BERRY, FERRY, JERRY, DERRY.

Among these, let's pick BERRY as the most common.
