For my first guess, I should choose a word that helps me gather as much information as possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This increases the chances of hitting some correct letters or eliminating many incorrect ones.

Good options typically include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L). A balanced combination of these letters works well.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- S is very common in 5-letter words
- L is a frequent consonant
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- T is also very common

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S = x → S is NOT in the word.
- L = - → L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2).
- A = - → A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- T = x → T is NOT in the word.
- E = - → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).

So the secret word must:
- contain the letters L, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively)
- NOT contain S or T

Let’s try to place those three letters in new positions while avoiding the excluded ones.

Possible letters left to explore: B C D F G H I J K M N O P Q R U V W X Y Z  
We still need to test some additional consonants.

A good second guess should place L, A, E in new positions and introduce other common consonants.  
One strong candidate is “REALM”:
- R is a common untested consonant
- E moves from position 5 to 1
- A moves from position 3 to 2
- L moves from position 2 to 3
- M is a common untested consonant

It obeys all the constraints we have so far.

Let’s digest the new feedback:

REALM → R(-) E(-) A(-) L(✓) M(x)

- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- L is in the correct position (position 4).  
- M is not in the word.

Combining with the earlier feedback:

Known letters that must appear: L (and it must be in slot 4), E, A, R  
Letters definitely absent: S, T, M  

Still need to determine the exact slots for E, A, R and the fifth letter.

Possible positions:
- Slot 1: not R (from REALM feedback) and not S/T/M (already ruled out).  
- Slot 2: not E (from REALM) and not L (already fixed at 4).  
- Slot 3: not A (from REALM) and not L.  
- Slot 5: not E (from SLATE feedback).

So we have:
1: open (cannot be R,S,T,M)  
2: open (cannot be E,L,S,T,M)  
3: open (cannot be A,L,S,T,M)  
4: L  
5: open (cannot be E,S,T,M)

We need to place A, E, R among slots 1,2,3,5.  
Slot 5 could be one of A/R/E but not E (from SLATE), so slot 5 ∈ {A,R}.  
Slot 3 cannot be A, so slot 3 ∈ {E,R}.  
Slot 2 cannot be E, so slot 2 must be either A or R (but A is still possible here).  
Slot 1 can be A/E/R.

Let’s list coherent permutations that satisfy all constraints.  
A couple of promising patterns:

- Pattern 1: R _ A _ L  
- Pattern 2: A _ E _ L  
- Pattern 3: E _ R _ L  
- Pattern 4: _ A R _ L (but slot 1 can’t be R; ok, so slot 1 could be A/E)  
- Pattern 5: _ R A _ L (but slot 3 can’t be A)

The pattern “_ A R _ L” looks impossible because slot 3 would be R, which is allowed.  
Let’s try concrete words.

Possible words that fit “? A R ? L”:
- FAROL (not common)  
- BARREL is 6 letters  
- CAROL (common, 5 letters) – but does it contain all required letters?  
CAROL has C,A,R,O,L. We know L is correct, A and R must be present, E is also required but missing from CAROL → reject.

Try “E A R _ L”: positions 1-3-5 would be E,A,L but we know L is fixed at 4.  
So “EAR?L” – E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, L in 4.  
That yields EAR L _, so fifth letter at 5 is unknown.  
We also know slot 5 can’t be E (from SLATE) and must be one of remaining allowed letters.

What five-letter words are of the form E A R ? L or similar?  
EARLY: E A R L Y  
Check constraints:
- L is at 4 ✓  
- A is at 2 (allowed, because earlier A was at 3 and feedback said “-” → ok to move to 2)  
- E is at 1 (allowed, because earlier E was at 5 and feedback said “-” → ok to move to 1)  
- R is at 3 (allowed, because earlier R was at 1 and feedback said “-” → ok to move to 3)  
Letters: E, A, R, L, Y. All required letters are present, no banned letters appear.

So EARLY is a valid next guess.
