For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the target word. A good starting word should have a mix of frequently used letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.

Commonly recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- Three very common vowels (A, E)
- Common consonants (S, L, T)
- No letter repeats

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.
