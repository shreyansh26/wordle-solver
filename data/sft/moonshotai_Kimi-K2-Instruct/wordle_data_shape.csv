1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. 

Looking at frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good opening word should contain several of these common letters while avoiding repeats to test more letters. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice as it contains S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters. However, since I want to be slightly different, I'll choose ""RAISE"" which contains R, A, I, S, E - also very common letters with good coverage.

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so S is in the word but not in position 4

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

3. SHAME → S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms S, H, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.
   - Only position 4 is unknown and must be a letter we haven’t ruled out.

Letters already confirmed: S, H, A, E
Letters ruled out so far: R, I, C, M

Common remaining consonants for position 4: L, N, T, D, G, B, F, K, P, etc.

The pattern is SHA_E. Common 5-letter words fitting this:
- SHALE (but L is common)
- SHANE (but N is common)
- SHAKE
- SHADE
- SHAVE
- SHALE
- SHAME (already tried, M ruled out)

Among these, ""SHAKE"" uses K, another common letter, and hasn’t been tested yet.
