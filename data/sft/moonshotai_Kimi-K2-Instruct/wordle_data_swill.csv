For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, I, S, and H. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This should give me good coverage for identifying correct letters early.

All five letters in CRANE are **not** in the secret word at all (C, R, A, N, E are all marked with x).  
That eliminates a huge chunk of 5-letter words, so my next guess should avoid every one of those letters.

Good remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y  

A balanced word that uses several of the still-possible common letters is:
- S, T, O, L, I  → “STOLI” (but not a common English word)
- S, T, O, I, D  → “STOID” (also uncommon)
- S, T, O, I, L  → “STOIL” (not valid)
- S, T, O, I, M  → “STOIM” (not valid)

Let me pick a valid word with distinct letters from the still-allowed pool.  
“STOUT” uses S, T, O, U, T – T is repeated, so less informative.  
“STUMP” uses S, T, U, M, P – all distinct and still allowed.  
“SPOUT” uses S, P, O, U, T – also all distinct and allowed.  
Between “STUMP” and “SPOUT”, both are good; I’ll go with **STUMP**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, I, S, and H. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This should give me good coverage for identifying correct letters early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE are **not** in the secret word at all (C, R, A, N, E are all marked with x).  
That eliminates a huge chunk of 5-letter words, so my next guess should avoid every one of those letters.

Good remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y  

A balanced word that uses several of the still-possible common letters is:
- S, T, O, L, I  → “STOLI” (but not a common English word)
- S, T, O, I, D  → “STOID” (also uncommon)
- S, T, O, I, L  → “STOIL” (not valid)
- S, T, O, I, M  → “STOIM” (not valid)

Let me pick a valid word with distinct letters from the still-allowed pool.  
“STOUT” uses S, T, O, U, T – T is repeated, so less informative.  
“STUMP” uses S, T, U, M, P – all distinct and still allowed.  
“SPOUT” uses S, P, O, U, T – also all distinct and allowed.  
Between “STUMP” and “SPOUT”, both are good; I’ll go with **STUMP**.

Common remaining vowels: I, O

Now we know:

1. S _ _ _ L (first letter S ✓ and last letter L ✓).
2. The letters I and L are still in their wrong positions.
   - For I: must be in word, but NOT in position 2 (from SIBYL feedback: I(-)).
   - For L: must be in word and we already have L in position 5 (✓), so it’s now correctly placed and no longer “wrong-position”.
3. Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, M, P, O, D, B, Y.
4. Available letters left: F, G, H, K, V, W, plus the still-needed I (which must fit somewhere between positions 2-4) and any other allowed letters not yet ruled out.

So the pattern is S _ _ I L (because I cannot be in position 2 and must appear somewhere, and positions 3 and 4 remain for it).

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and ends in IL.

Possible candidates:
- S, _, _, I, L → “SKILL” (but K and L are allowed, I is allowed).  
  Check letters: S, K, I, L – L is already ✓, K is allowed.  
  SKILL: K is allowed, I is allowed, no eliminated letters.

- “SWILL” – W and I, L are allowed, but word has double L which is fine, but let’s see if we have a better fit.

- “SIGIL” – G, I are allowed, but we need I in position 4, not 3.

- “SPIEL” – P is eliminated.

Thus, the best next guess is **SKILL**.

Check constraints:
- SKILL: S(✓), K, I, L, L – only single L is needed, but the word is valid.
- No eliminated letters used.
- Positions: S _ _ I L fits because I is now in position 4 (allowed) and L is correctly at 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, I, S, and H. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This should give me good coverage for identifying correct letters early.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE are **not** in the secret word at all (C, R, A, N, E are all marked with x).  
That eliminates a huge chunk of 5-letter words, so my next guess should avoid every one of those letters.

Good remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y  

A balanced word that uses several of the still-possible common letters is:
- S, T, O, L, I  → “STOLI” (but not a common English word)
- S, T, O, I, D  → “STOID” (also uncommon)
- S, T, O, I, L  → “STOIL” (not valid)
- S, T, O, I, M  → “STOIM” (not valid)

Let me pick a valid word with distinct letters from the still-allowed pool.  
“STOUT” uses S, T, O, U, T – T is repeated, so less informative.  
“STUMP” uses S, T, U, M, P – all distinct and still allowed.  
“SPOUT” uses S, P, O, U, T – also all distinct and allowed.  
Between “STUMP” and “SPOUT”, both are good; I’ll go with **STUMP**.

Guess 2: STUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, M, P  
- The first letter is **S** (✓), so the word is of the form S _ _ _ _  
- Allowed letters left (from the alphabet minus the above):  
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
  plus the vowels I, O, Y (since A, E, U are gone)

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, W  
Common remaining vowels: I, O  

A good 5-letter pattern is S _ _ _ _.  
We want to test new letters quickly while keeping S fixed.  
A word like “SHOWN” uses S, H, O, W, N – but N is already out.  
“SOLID” uses S, O, L, I, D – all still allowed.  
“SLICK” uses S, L, I, C, K – C is out, K is allowed.  
“SLOTH” uses S, L, O, T, H – T is out.  
“SWIFT” uses S, W, I, F, T – T is out.

“SOLID” looks the best: uses S, O, L, I, D – all still allowed, no repeats, common word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (first letter is S and in the right place)
- Letters known to be somewhere in the word: L, I (both marked “-”, so they are present but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively).
- Letters ruled out completely: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, M, P, O, D.

Remaining letters to test: B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, plus the still-allowed vowels I (already known to be in), and Y.

Positions:

1: S (fixed)
2: ?
3: must contain L (but not in position 3)
4: must contain I (but not in position 4)
5: ?

So L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, and I must be in position 2, 3, or 5, with positions 3 and 4 excluded respectively.

Let’s try a word that places L in position 2 and I in position 3:

S L I _ _

A common word fitting this pattern is SLICK – but C is already ruled out.

Next possibility: SLI _ _ isn’t valid because that only leaves three letters. Let’s try placing L in position 2 and I in position 5: S L _ _ I

A valid word: SLIMY – uses S, L, I, M, Y. M is ruled out (from STUMP feedback), so SLIMY is invalid.

Try placing L in position 4: S _ I L _

But I is not allowed in position 4 (SOLID feedback: I is in word but not in position 4), so I must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Alternative: place I in position 2 and L in position 3: S I L _ _

But L is not allowed in position 3 (SOLID feedback: L is in word but not in position 3), so that’s invalid.

Next: place I in position 2 and L in position 5: S I _ _ L

A valid word: SIZZL – invalid (double Z and not common).

Another: SI _ _ L → SIGHT – but G and H are still allowed.

But let’s list valid common words that fit constraints:

- SLI _ _ : SLICK (invalid C), SLIDE (invalid D), SLIME (invalid M), SLING, SLINK, SLIPS (invalid P), SLITS (invalid T)
- S _ L _ _ : SWILL (invalid W I L L), SKILL (invalid K, I, L, L)
- S _ _ L _ : SHILL (invalid H, I, L, L)
- S _ _ _ L : SWIRL (invalid W, R, I), SPIEL (invalid P, E), SKILL (invalid K, I, L, L)

Hmm, let’s try SLINK: S, L, I, N, K – N is ruled out (CRANE feedback).

Next: SWIRL – W, I, R, L – R is ruled out.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:

We know:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- L must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- I must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible overlaps:
1. L in 2, I in 3: S L I _ _
   - SLI _ _ needs two letters from allowed set: B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y
   - SLI _ _ valid words: SLICK (invalid C), SLIDE (invalid D), SLIME (invalid M), SLING (N invalid), SLINK (N invalid), SLIPS (P invalid), SLITS (T invalid) – none valid.

2. L in 2, I in 5: S L _ _ I
   - SL _ _ I: SLIMI (invalid), SLYMI (invalid), SL_ _ I
   - Only plausible: SL _ _ I → SLIMI (invalid), SL _ _ I – no common words.

3. L in 4, I in 2: S I _ L _
   - SI _ L _ : SIGIL (invalid G, I, L), SIBYL (B, Y, L), but Y and L allowed.
   - SIBYL: S, I, B, Y, L – all letters allowed (B, Y, L not yet ruled out).
   - Check letters: S (✓), I (known to be in word), B (new), Y (new), L (known to be in word).
   - This fits all constraints.

4. L in 4, I in 3: S _ I L _ – but I is not allowed in 4 (but this is position 3), so valid, but need two more letters.
   - S _ I L _ : S, _, I, L, _ – but we have no good candidates (e.g., S, B, I, L, Y → SBILY – invalid).

5. L in 5, I in 2: S I _ _ L
   - SI _ _ L : S, I, _, _, L – e.g., SIZZL (invalid), SIBYL (already considered).

6. L in 5, I in 3: S _ I _ L
   - S _ I _ L : S, _, I, _, L – e.g., S, K, I, Y, L → SKIYL (invalid), S, B, I, Y, L → SBIYL (invalid), S, F, I, Y, L → SFIYL (invalid) – no valid words.

Thus, the best valid word fitting constraints is **SIBYL**.

Still-allowed consonants: F,G,H,J,Q,V,W,X,Z (plus the vowels none left except I already used)

Among these, common English words ending in ILL are:
- SKILL – but K is eliminated
- SPILL – P is eliminated
- STILL – T is eliminated
- SWILL – W is allowed
- SHILL – H is allowed

Between SWILL and SHILL, let’s pick **SHILL** because “H” is still allowed and it is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next (and likely final) guess is SHILL.
