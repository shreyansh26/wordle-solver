For my first guess, I need a 5-letter word that maximizes the information gained. The best opening guesses are those that use common letters and cover a wide range of possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct, common letters.

After considering options like ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", and ""SLATE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This gives me good coverage across consonants and vowels.

From the feedback:  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position.  
A(x) – A is not in the word.  
T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct 4th position.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has the form _ _ _ T _.
2. It contains L somewhere, but not in position 2.
3. It does not contain S, A, or E.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been used yet include R, I, N, O, U, C, D, etc. I want to test several of these while also repositioning L.

A good candidate is “TRULY”:
- T is already confirmed in position 4.  
- L is repositioned to 3rd place (allowed, since previous feedback only said “wrong position”).  
- Adds R, U, Y as new letters to check.

Other candidates like “BUILT”, “GUILT”, or “FAULT” would also work, but “TRULY” keeps it simple with common letters. I’ll go with “TRULY”.

Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

Feedback recap:
1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - Word pattern so far: _ _ _ T _
   - L is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - Letters not present: S, A, E.

2. TRULY → T(-) R(x) U(x) L(-) Y(✓)
   - T appeared in position 1 here and was marked “-”.  
     But from SLATE we know T is actually in position 4, so the “-” simply confirms T is elsewhere (which we already knew).
   - R and U are not in the word at all.
   - L appears again and is again marked “-” (still present but not in position 4).
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position, i.e., position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ _ _ T Y
Letters already ruled out: S, A, E, R, U.
Known letters to place: L (not in positions 2 or 4), plus two unknown letters.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Fills positions 1, 2, 3.
- Tries new, common letters we haven’t tested yet (e.g., N, I, D, G, C).
- Keeps the known letters T (in position 4) and Y (in position 5).

Candidate: “BLUNT” – but U is ruled out.  
“FLINT” – uses F, L, I, N, T (but T must be in 4th spot).  
“GLINT” – G, L, I, N, T – positions 1-3-4-5 match our pattern if we rearrange to _ _ _ T Y, so swap T and Y positions.

Wait, no: pattern is _ _ _ T Y. We need letters 1-2-3 plus T in 4 and Y in 5.

The simplest valid candidate is “FLINT” rearranged to “FLINT” itself doesn’t fit _ _ _ T Y.  
Correct approach is to list words ending in “TY” with L somewhere else.

Examples: “FAULTY” (6 letters, too long), “BILTY” (invalid), “GILTY” (invalid).  
Actually, we must find a 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ T Y.

Let’s list 5-letter words ending in “TY”:
- BLOTY – no
- CRYPT – C, R, Y, P, T – R is ruled out.
- DITTY – D, I, T, T, Y – T repeats, but we only have one T confirmed.
- FELTY – E is ruled out.
- GILTY – G, I, L, T, Y – this fits: _ _ _ T Y, with L in position 3.  
  Letters used: G, I, L, T, Y.  
  Ruled out letters not used: avoids S, A, E, R, U.  
  L is in position 3, which is allowed (only positions 2 and 4 were marked wrong).

“GILTY” is valid.

“GLINT” – G, L, I, N, T – positions 1-3-4-5 match our pattern if we rearrange to _ _ _ T Y, so swap T and Y positions.

Wait, no: pattern is _ _ _ T Y. We need letters 1-2-3 plus T in 4 and Y in 5.

The simplest valid candidate is “FLINT” rearranged to “FLINT” itself doesn’t fit _ _ _ T Y.  
Correct approach is to list words ending in “TY” with L somewhere else.

Examples: “FAULTY” (6 letters, too long), “BILTY” (invalid), “GILTY” (invalid).  
Actually, we must find a 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ T Y.

Let’s list 5-letter words ending in “TY”:
- BLOTY – no
- CRYPT – C, R, Y, P, T – R is ruled out.
- DITTY – D, I, T, T, Y – T repeats, but we only have one T confirmed.
- FELTY – E is ruled out.
- GILTY – G, I, L, T, Y – this fits: _ _ _ T Y, with L in position 3.  
  Letters used: G, I, L, T, Y.  
  Ruled out letters not used: avoids S, A, E, R, U.  
  L is in position 3, which is allowed (only positions 2 and 4 were marked wrong).

“GILTY” is valid.

Another option: “MILTY” – but M hasn’t been tested; G gives new consonant.  
Let’s choose “GILTY”.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   – Pattern _ _ _ T _
   – L present, not in position 2
   – S, A, E absent

2. TRULY → T(-) R(x) U(x) L(-) Y(✓)
   – Confirms T not in position 1
   – R, U absent
   – Y present and in position 5 (because it was ✓ in TRULY)

3. GILTY → G(x) I(x) L(-) T(✓) Y(✓)
   – G, I absent
   – L still marked “-”, so NOT in position 3
   – T is still ✓ in position 4
   – Y is ✓ in position 5

Therefore the pattern is now:
_ _ _ T Y

Known letters:
- T (fixed at 4)
- Y (fixed at 5)
- L must appear exactly once, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.
  Possible positions: 1 or 5. Position 5 is already Y, so L must be in position 1.

Hence the word is L _ _ T Y.

Letters already ruled out:
S, A, E, R, U, G, I

Remaining relatively common letters to try in positions 2 and 3:
C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form L ? ? T Y.

Possible candidates:
- LOFTY – uses O (allowed) and F. O has not been tested yet.
- LEFTY – uses E (but E is ruled out)
- LUSTY – uses U (ruled out)
- LAPTY – invalid
- LINTY – uses N and I, but I is ruled out
- LOFTY – L, O, F, T, Y – letters all allowed and positions match.

LOFTY seems the only common word left that fits every constraint.
