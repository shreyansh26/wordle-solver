For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common and uses letters that are frequently found in English words. This helps maximize the amount of information I can gain from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants, avoiding less frequent letters like 'x' or 'z'. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- It also covers 5 distinct letters, increasing the chance of hitting correct letters or positions.

Another good option is ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a popular and effective starter.

From the feedback:
- T is correct in position 5 ( _ _ _ _ T ).
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

So:
1. We know the word ends with T.
2. We can eliminate all words containing S, L, A, E.
3. We haven’t tested any of these remaining letters yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the final T fixed (or at least not move it, because it’s already correct).
- Use as many new common consonants and vowels as possible, avoiding S, L, A, E.

Possible common consonants left: R, N, D, M, C, K, H, G, B, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (A and E are out).

A strong candidate is “FRUIT” because:
- Ends with T (though we already know T is last, so we’d actually keep it last anyway).
- Uses F, R, U, I, which are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.
But “FRUIT” keeps T last, which is already known, so it tests four new letters in positions 1-4.

Another good option is “CHORD” but it ends with D, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful since we know the final letter must be T.

So the best is to keep T in position 5 and test new letters in positions 1-4, like “FRUIT.”
Wait—actually “FRUIT” ends with T, so that’s good. But it uses U and I, which are new vowels, and F and R, which are new consonants.

But let me double-check: does “FRUIT” end with T? No—“FRUIT” ends with T, which is correct, but actually it ends with T. So it’s valid.

Alternatively, “BRICK” ends with K, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful.

“POINT” ends with T, uses P, O, I, N—all new letters (no S, L, A, E). That’s also good.

Between “FRUIT” and “POINT,” “POINT” has slightly more common letters overall, so I’ll go with that.

Wait—does “POINT” have any forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T—none are S, L, A, E. So it’s valid.

Therefore, my next guess is “POINT.”

1. Position 5: In guess 1, T is ✓ (correct place).  
   In guess 2, T is marked (-) for position 5, which might look conflicting, but that’s just a mis-notation—since T must be fixed in position 5 from guess 1, the (-) in guess 2 simply re-confirms T is in the word but already placed correctly.  
   So the word ends with T.

2. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, I, N (all x).

3. Known correct letter: O in position 2 (✓).

“POINT” ends with T, uses P, O, I, N—all new letters (no S, L, A, E). That’s also good.

Between “FRUIT” and “POINT,” “POINT” has slightly more common letters overall, so I’ll go with that.

Wait—does “POINT” have any forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T—none are S, L, A, E. So it’s valid.

Therefore, my next guess is “POINT.”

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. Position 5: In guess 1, T is ✓ (correct place).  
   In guess 2, T is marked (-) for position 5, which might look conflicting, but that’s just a mis-notation—since T must be fixed in position 5 from guess 1, the (-) in guess 2 simply re-confirms T is in the word but already placed correctly.  
   So the word ends with T.

2. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, I, N (all x).

3. Known correct letter: O in position 2 (✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ _ T

We still need to test new letters.  
Good remaining consonants (not yet ruled out) include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowel: only U is left (A, E, I, O already handled).

A strong candidate that fits _ O _ _ T and uses only untested letters is “Doubt” (but it has B and U, both allowed).  
Another candidate is “Court” (C, R, U, O, T).  
“Court” uses C, R, U which are all new and common.

Let me check: C, O, U, R, T—none are in the forbidden set (S, L, A, E, P, I, N).  
So “COURT” fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This helps maximize the amount of information I can gain from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants, avoiding less frequent letters like 'x' or 'z'. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- It also covers 5 distinct letters, increasing the chance of hitting correct letters or positions.

Another good option is ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a popular and effective starter.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- T is correct in position 5 ( _ _ _ _ T ).
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

So:
1. We know the word ends with T.
2. We can eliminate all words containing S, L, A, E.
3. We haven’t tested any of these remaining letters yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the final T fixed (or at least not move it, because it’s already correct).
- Use as many new common consonants and vowels as possible, avoiding S, L, A, E.

Possible common consonants left: R, N, D, M, C, K, H, G, B, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (A and E are out).

A strong candidate is “FRUIT” because:
- Ends with T (though we already know T is last, so we’d actually keep it last anyway).
- Uses F, R, U, I, which are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.
But “FRUIT” keeps T last, which is already known, so it tests four new letters in positions 1-4.

Another good option is “CHORD” but it ends with D, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful since we know the final letter must be T.

So the best is to keep T in position 5 and test new letters in positions 1-4, like “FRUIT.”
Wait—actually “FRUIT” ends with T, so that’s good. But it uses U and I, which are new vowels, and F and R, which are new consonants.

But let me double-check: does “FRUIT” end with T? No—“FRUIT” ends with T, which is correct, but actually it ends with T. So it’s valid.

Alternatively, “BRICK” ends with K, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful.

“POINT” ends with T, uses P, O, I, N—all new letters (no S, L, A, E). That’s also good.

Between “FRUIT” and “POINT,” “POINT” has slightly more common letters overall, so I’ll go with that.

Wait—does “POINT” have any forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T—none are S, L, A, E. So it’s valid.

Therefore, my next guess is “POINT.”

Notice the feedback for GODOT shows the second O was marked “-”, meaning the word contains at least one more O but that extra O is NOT in position 4.  
Since position 2 is already the first O, the third letter must be the second O (because positions 1,3,4 can hold it, but position 4 is ruled out by the “-”).  
Hence the pattern is forced to: _ O O _ T

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,tooth,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common and uses letters that are frequently found in English words. This helps maximize the amount of information I can gain from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants, avoiding less frequent letters like 'x' or 'z'. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- It also covers 5 distinct letters, increasing the chance of hitting correct letters or positions.

Another good option is ""CRANE,"" but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a popular and effective starter.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- T is correct in position 5 ( _ _ _ _ T ).
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

So:
1. We know the word ends with T.
2. We can eliminate all words containing S, L, A, E.
3. We haven’t tested any of these remaining letters yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the final T fixed (or at least not move it, because it’s already correct).
- Use as many new common consonants and vowels as possible, avoiding S, L, A, E.

Possible common consonants left: R, N, D, M, C, K, H, G, B, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (A and E are out).

A strong candidate is “FRUIT” because:
- Ends with T (though we already know T is last, so we’d actually keep it last anyway).
- Uses F, R, U, I, which are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.
But “FRUIT” keeps T last, which is already known, so it tests four new letters in positions 1-4.

Another good option is “CHORD” but it ends with D, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful since we know the final letter must be T.

So the best is to keep T in position 5 and test new letters in positions 1-4, like “FRUIT.”
Wait—actually “FRUIT” ends with T, so that’s good. But it uses U and I, which are new vowels, and F and R, which are new consonants.

But let me double-check: does “FRUIT” end with T? No—“FRUIT” ends with T, which is correct, but actually it ends with T. So it’s valid.

Alternatively, “BRICK” ends with K, which we don’t know yet—so not helpful.

“POINT” ends with T, uses P, O, I, N—all new letters (no S, L, A, E). That’s also good.

Between “FRUIT” and “POINT,” “POINT” has slightly more common letters overall, so I’ll go with that.

Wait—does “POINT” have any forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T—none are S, L, A, E. So it’s valid.

Therefore, my next guess is “POINT.”

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. Position 5: In guess 1, T is ✓ (correct place).  
   In guess 2, T is marked (-) for position 5, which might look conflicting, but that’s just a mis-notation—since T must be fixed in position 5 from guess 1, the (-) in guess 2 simply re-confirms T is in the word but already placed correctly.  
   So the word ends with T.

2. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, I, N (all x).

3. Known correct letter: O in position 2 (✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ _ T

We still need to test new letters.  
Good remaining consonants (not yet ruled out) include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowel: only U is left (A, E, I, O already handled).

A strong candidate that fits _ O _ _ T and uses only untested letters is “Doubt” (but it has B and U, both allowed).  
Another candidate is “Court” (C, R, U, O, T).  
“Court” uses C, R, U which are all new and common.

Let me check: C, O, U, R, T—none are in the forbidden set (S, L, A, E, P, I, N).  
So “COURT” fits all constraints.

3. Still-allowed letters we have not tried:  
   - Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   - Vowels: none left (A, E, I, O, U all either placed or eliminated)

We need three more consonants in positions 1, 3, 4 that are:
- not yet eliminated,  
- can form a valid 5-letter word ending in O _ _ T.

Quick scan of common English words fitting _O__T:
- BLOWT – no  
- BOMBT – no  
- DOGOT – no  
- FOGOT – no  
- GODOT – “GODOT” is valid (as in “Waiting for Godot”)  
- HOMOT – no  
- JOWET – no  
- MOBOT – no  
- VOMIT – but it ends in T and has O in spot 2: V O M I T – but I is eliminated.  
- WOVET – no

The only real option that survives the banned-letter list is G O D O T → GODOT.

Letters used: G, O, D, O, T  
- G, D, O, T have never been marked x.  
- O and T are already confirmed correct in their positions.

Thus, GODOT is a valid next guess.

Current constraints:
- Pattern so far: _ O O T _
- Position 5 must be T (from guess 1), so the word must be _ O O T T.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, P, I, N, C, U, R, G, D, F, Y
- Still-allowed letters not yet tried: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with one of the allowed letters (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)
2. Has O in positions 2 and 3
3. Has T in positions 4 and 5
4. Uses only allowed letters

The only possible word is ROOTT, but R is eliminated. 
Next possibility is MOOTT, but that's not a valid English word.
Looking at valid English words, the only 5-letter word ending with OOTT is ""BOOTT"" (but that's not standard) or ""BOOTY"" (but Y is eliminated).

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern from the FOOTY feedback:
- F(x) - F is out
- O(✓) - O is correct in position 2
- O(✓) - O is correct in position 3
- T(✓) - T is correct in position 4
- Y(x) - Y is out

This means the pattern is _ O O T _ with T in position 4, but we know from guess 1 that T is in position 5. This appears contradictory.

Ah! I see the confusion - in FOOTY feedback, T is marked ✓ in position 4, but we know T must be in position 5. This suggests an inconsistency in feedback notation. However, following strictly that position 5 is T (from guess 1), and the latest feedback shows positions 2-4 as O-O-T, this would require T in both positions 4 and 5, which is impossible.

Re-evaluating: The correct interpretation is that in FOOTY feedback:
- Position 2 O: ✓ (correct)
- Position 3 O: ✓ (correct)
- Position 4 T: ✓ (correct)
- Position 5 Y: x (incorrect)

This would imply the word is _ O O T _ with T in position 4, but we know T must be in position 5. This can only mean the word has T in positions 4 AND 5, forming ""TOOTT"" - but this isn't valid.

Realizing the mistake: The pattern must be _ O O T with T at the end, making the word structure _ O O T. But we need 5 letters. The only possible valid word is ""BOOST"" - but S is eliminated. 

After careful reconsideration, the only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is ""BOOTY"" but Y is eliminated. This suggests the word must have double O and end with T, leading to ""MOOT"" + T = ""MOOTT"" (invalid) or ""BOOTT"" (invalid).

Upon closer inspection, the correct 5-letter word fitting _ O O T _ with T in position 5 and all other constraints is ""BOOTH"" - but this doesn't match the O-O-T pattern. Realizing the error, the actual word must be ""BOOTH"" but that doesn't fit.

Finally recognizing the only valid remaining possibility: The word is ""BOOTS"" but S is out. The actual valid word is ""BOOTY"" but Y is out. This leaves only one possible answer that satisfies all: ""BOOTH"" but this contradicts the pattern.

After systematic elimination, the only possible remaining word is ""MOOTH"" - but H is allowed and not eliminated. Checking: M, O, O, T, H - none are in the eliminated list (M, O, T, H are all allowed). ""MOOTH"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to complain or grumble.

Therefore, the correct next guess is MOOTH.
