For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can quickly help me identify common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular starting choices because they contain a mix of vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me a good spread of letters to work with for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
- A(-) – A is somewhere in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
- I(✓) – I is in the word and correctly placed in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) – S is not in the word.  
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- 3rd letter = I
- Word contains A but A is not in position 2
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E

I want a word that:
- Has I in the 3rd spot
- Uses A in a different position (not 2)
- Avoids R, S, E

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
Vowels still possible: O, U (since A is already confirmed, I is fixed, and E is out).

Possible candidates:
- PAINT – has A in 2nd spot (forbidden), so no
- GRAINS – too long
- TAPIR – has R and P, but R is out
- DAISY – has S and Y (Y sometimes vowel, but S is out)
- UNLIT – no A
- CANDI – has C, A, N, D, I – let me check positions: C-A-N-D-I; A would be 2nd (forbidden), so no
- VITAL – has A in 3rd, but I already occupies 3rd
- VALID – V-A-L-I-D; A is 2nd (no), I is 4th (no)
- AVOID – A in 1st, V, O, I, D; has I in 4th (no), A in 1st (ok), avoids R,S,E. But I must be 3rd
- PAINT – already ruled out

A X I O M – positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:O, 5:M

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
Round 2 AXIOM → A(✓) X(x) I(✓) O(x) M(-)

What we now know:

1. The word is 5 letters long.
2. Position 3 is definitely I (from both rounds).
3. Position 1 is definitely A (because A is now marked ✓ in AXIOM).
4. M is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5 (it was marked “-”).
5. Letters to avoid completely: R, S, E, X, O.
6. So far the pattern is:

   A _ I _ _

   and somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 we must place M plus two other valid letters (no repeats of forbidden letters).

Possible letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
Vowels used so far: A, I (fixed).  
Remaining vowels: U, Y (sometimes), but U is safer.

Consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z.  
Plus M is known to be in the word somewhere.

We need a word that:
- starts with A
- has I in position 3
- contains M in position 2, 4, or 5
- uses only allowed letters.

Let’s brainstorm:

Position 1: A  
Position 3: I  
M must appear in 2, 4, or 5.

Try:

- A M I _ _  
  Need two more letters for positions 4 & 5, no repeats.  
  Good candidates: AMITY – but T, Y are still allowed.  
  However, AMITY has Y at position 5 and T at 4: both fine.  
  No forbidden letters.

- A _ I M _  
  2nd letter: choose from B, C, D, F, etc.  
  Example: A C I M _ → need a 5th letter.  
  ACIMB?  Not a word.  
  AF... nothing common.

- A _ I _ M  
  2nd letter and 4th letter: e.g., A V I N M – not a word.  
  A V I D M – not a word.

AMITY is the only common word that fits A M I _ _.  
Let’s check it: A M I T Y  
Letters: A(1 ✓), M(2), I(3 ✓), T(4), Y(5)  
No repeats, none of the forbidden letters (R,S,E,X,O).  
So AMITY looks perfect.

- starts with A
- has I in position 3
- contains M in position 2, 4, or 5
- uses only allowed letters.

Let’s brainstorm:

Position 1: A  
Position 3: I  
M must appear in 2, 4, or 5.

Try:

- A M I _ _  
  Need two more letters for positions 4 & 5, no repeats.  
  Good candidates: AMITY – but T, Y are still allowed.  
  However, AMITY has Y at position 5 and T at 4: both fine.  
  No forbidden letters.

- A _ I M _  
  2nd letter: choose from B, C, D, F, etc.  
  Example: A C I M _ → need a 5th letter.  
  ACIMB?  Not a word.  
  AF... nothing common.

- A _ I _ M  
  2nd letter and 4th letter: e.g., A V I N M – not a word.  
  A V I D M – not a word.

AMITY is the only common word that fits A M I _ _.  
Let’s check it: A M I T Y  
Letters: A(1 ✓), M(2), I(3 ✓), T(4), Y(5)  
No repeats, none of the forbidden letters (R,S,E,X,O).  
So AMITY looks perfect.",Guess 3: AMITY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(✓) I(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
