For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (another frequent letter)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
Therefore, any new guess must avoid those letters entirely.  
I need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates among the remaining high-frequency letters are: T, S, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.  
Combining them into common 5-letter words gives options like:

Two full guesses have now eliminated 10 distinct letters:  
C, R, A, N, E, S, T, U, M, P are all confirmed **NOT** in the secret word.

Remaining very-common letters are roughly:  
Vowels: I, O  
Consonants: L, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W

I want a word that uses five of these yet is still a common, valid 5-letter English word.  
Good candidate letters: B, L, O, D, I, G, K, F, H, Y.

A simple high-frequency word built from them is “BLOCK”.  
It uses B, L, O, C, K.  
However, C is already ruled out (x on CRANE), so “BLOCK” is invalid.

Next option: “DOLLY” — uses D, O, L, L, Y.  
C is gone, S, T, U, M, P are gone, so these letters are all still possible.  
“DOLLY” is a common word and tests D, O, L, Y.

Another candidate: “GOLLY” (G, O, L, L, Y).  
Either is fine, but “GOLLY” brings in G, which is still possible and quite common.

So far we know none of: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U,M,P,G,L,Y are in the word at all (x).  
The only letter we know is in the word but in the wrong place is O (from the “-” in GOLLY).  
Remaining very common letters are:  
vowels: I, maybe O (already confirmed present), no others left.  
consonants left: B,D,F,H,K,J,Q,V,W,X,Z (but J,Q,X,Z are rare).  
So the most frequent remaining consonants are B,D,F,H,K,W.

Since the word must be 5 letters and must contain O (and only O from the vowels so far), I need a common 5-letter word that uses O plus some of B,D,F,H,K,W and avoids every letter already ruled out.

Let’s list possibilities quickly:
- B, D, F, H, K, W + O.

Good candidates:
- WORD  – but R and D are both still possible yet R is ruled out (x) so NO.  
- FLOCK – C,L,K ruled out.  
- HONEY – N,E,Y ruled out.  
- KNOBS – N,S,K,B,S ruled out.  
- WOMBY – M,Y,B – M and Y ruled out.  
- WODGE – G ruled out.  
- WHIFF – H,F,F – possible but two F’s seems less informative.

Actually the simplest untouched common letters are D, I, O, W, K, F, H.

Looking for a clean word:  
- “WHISK” – S,K ruled out.  
- “FOXID” – X ruled out.  

Wait, we haven’t used I yet and I is still possible.  
A 5-letter word with O and I plus remaining consonants:  
- “DOWIK” – not a real word.  
- “VIDIO” – not a word.  
- “FIORD” – R,D – R ruled out.  
- “WIDOW” – W,I,D,O,W – uses D, I, O, W.  All letters are still possible: W, I, D, O, W.  
And “WIDOW” is a valid English word.

Let me double-check each letter in WIDOW against the bans:
W – never seen before (ok)  
I – never seen before (ok)  
D – never seen before (ok)  
O – confirmed in word (ok)  
W – already ok.

So WIDOW is a strong fourth guess.

<guess>WIDOW</guess>",WIDOW,"So far we know none of: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,U,M,P,G,L,Y are in the word at all (x).  
The only letter we know is in the word but in the wrong place is O (from the “-” in GOLLY).  
Remaining very common letters are:  
vowels: I, maybe O (already confirmed present), no others left.  
consonants left: B,D,F,H,K,J,Q,V,W,X,Z (but J,Q,X,Z are rare).  
So the most frequent remaining consonants are B,D,F,H,K,W.

Since the word must be 5 letters and must contain O (and only O from the vowels so far), I need a common 5-letter word that uses O plus some of B,D,F,H,K,W and avoids every letter already ruled out.

Let’s list possibilities quickly:
- B, D, F, H, K, W + O.

Good candidates:
- WORD  – but R and D are both still possible yet R is ruled out (x) so NO.  
- FLOCK – C,L,K ruled out.  
- HONEY – N,E,Y ruled out.  
- KNOBS – N,S,K,B,S ruled out.  
- WOMBY – M,Y,B – M and Y ruled out.  
- WODGE – G ruled out.  
- WHIFF – H,F,F – possible but two F’s seems less informative.

Actually the simplest untouched common letters are D, I, O, W, K, F, H.

Looking for a clean word:  
- “WHISK” – S,K ruled out.  
- “FOXID” – X ruled out.  

Wait, we haven’t used I yet and I is still possible.  
A 5-letter word with O and I plus remaining consonants:  
- “DOWIK” – not a real word.  
- “VIDIO” – not a word.  
- “FIORD” – R,D – R ruled out.  
- “WIDOW” – W,I,D,O,W – uses D, I, O, W.  All letters are still possible: W, I, D, O, W.  
And “WIDOW” is a valid English word.

Let me double-check each letter in WIDOW against the bans:
W – never seen before (ok)  
I – never seen before (ok)  
D – never seen before (ok)  
O – confirmed in word (ok)  
W – already ok.

So WIDOW is a strong fourth guess.",Guess 4: WIDOW -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) I(✓) D(✓) O(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
