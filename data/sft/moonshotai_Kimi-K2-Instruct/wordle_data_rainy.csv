2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good coverage to potentially identify letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with mostly these letters, avoiding repeats to maximize information gain.

Looking at this, ""STARE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 common letters (S, T, A, R, E)
2. All letters are unique
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
4. It gives good coverage for vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R)

This should provide helpful feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S (1st letter) → x → S is NOT in the word
- T (2nd letter) → x → T is NOT in the word
- A (3rd letter) → – → A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position
- R (4th letter) → – → R is in the word but NOT in the 4th position
- E (5th letter) → x → E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Includes A and R
- Avoids positions 3 and 4 for A and R (but we don’t know their exact positions yet)
- Uses new common letters to maximize info (since S, T, E are ruled out)

Good remaining common letters: N, I, O, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

A solid second guess would be a word like ""RADIO"":
- Contains A and R
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed)
- R is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed)
- Uses new letters (D, I, O) to test additional possibilities

D(x) → D is not in the word  
I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 4  
O(x) → O is not in the word  

So far we know:
1. R is the first letter.
2. A is the second letter.
3. The remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must NOT contain D, S, T, E, O.
4. I is somewhere in the word but not position 4, so it must be in position 3 or 5.

Since we need three more letters and they must be common consonants (and must include I), a good next word is “RAINY”:
- It keeps R and A fixed in the correct positions.
- It places I in position 3 (testing that possibility).
- It introduces N and Y, two new common letters not yet ruled out.

If I is actually in position 5 instead, we’ll learn that next round.
