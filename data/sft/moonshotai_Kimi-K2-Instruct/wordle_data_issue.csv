For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to use a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T are **not** in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, and the word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.

Good letters to incorporate next: S, plus any other high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.) while avoiding L, A, T.

A strong next guess would be something like “SHINE”:
- S is in the word but not at the start (fits the feedback).
- H, I, N are new letters to test.
- E is already confirmed in the last position.

From the two rounds we know:

1. The last letter is E.
2. S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5—but position 5 is already E, so positions 2, 3, or 4).
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5—position 5 is E, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
4. Letters definitely not in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N.

We want a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both S and I, avoiding L, A, T, H, N, and with S not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- _ I S _ E   (I in 2, S in 3)
- _ S I _ E   (S in 2, I in 3 → forbidden, I can’t be in 3)
- I _ S _ E   (I in 1, S in 3)
- I _ _ S E   (I in 1, S in 4)
- _ _ I S E   (I in 3 → forbidden)
- _ S _ I E   (S in 2, I in 4)
- S is banned from position 1.

Scanning common words:
- R I S E N – but N is forbidden.
- P I S T E – T is forbidden.
- C R I S E – but only 4 letters.
- P R I S E – but ends in E and contains S, I; P, R are still allowed.
- P R I S E – valid 5-letter word: PRISE.

- Ends in E ✓
- Contains S and I ✓
- Doesn’t use L, A, T, H, N ✓
- S not in position 1 ✓
- I not in position 3 ✓

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,issue,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to use a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T are **not** in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, and the word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.

Good letters to incorporate next: S, plus any other high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.) while avoiding L, A, T.

A strong next guess would be something like “SHINE”:
- S is in the word but not at the start (fits the feedback).
- H, I, N are new letters to test.
- E is already confirmed in the last position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we know:

1. The last letter is E.
2. S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5—but position 5 is already E, so positions 2, 3, or 4).
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5—position 5 is E, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
4. Letters definitely not in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N.

We want a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both S and I, avoiding L, A, T, H, N, and with S not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- _ I S _ E   (I in 2, S in 3)
- _ S I _ E   (S in 2, I in 3 → forbidden, I can’t be in 3)
- I _ S _ E   (I in 1, S in 3)
- I _ _ S E   (I in 1, S in 4)
- _ _ I S E   (I in 3 → forbidden)
- _ S _ I E   (S in 2, I in 4)
- S is banned from position 1.

Scanning common words:
- R I S E N – but N is forbidden.
- P I S T E – T is forbidden.
- C R I S E – but only 4 letters.
- P R I S E – but ends in E and contains S, I; P, R are still allowed.
- P R I S E – valid 5-letter word: PRISE.

Check constraints:
- Ends in E ✓
- Contains S and I ✓
- Doesn’t use L, A, T, H, N ✓
- S not in position 1 ✓
- I not in position 3 ✓

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,issue,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to use a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in the first position.
- L, A, T are **not** in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, and the word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.

Good letters to incorporate next: S, plus any other high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet (like R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.) while avoiding L, A, T.

A strong next guess would be something like “SHINE”:
- S is in the word but not at the start (fits the feedback).
- H, I, N are new letters to test.
- E is already confirmed in the last position.

<guess>SHINE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we know:

1. The last letter is E.
2. S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5—but position 5 is already E, so positions 2, 3, or 4).
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5—position 5 is E, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
4. Letters definitely not in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N.

We want a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both S and I, avoiding L, A, T, H, N, and with S not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- _ I S _ E   (I in 2, S in 3)
- _ S I _ E   (S in 2, I in 3 → forbidden, I can’t be in 3)
- I _ S _ E   (I in 1, S in 3)
- I _ _ S E   (I in 1, S in 4)
- _ _ I S E   (I in 3 → forbidden)
- _ S _ I E   (S in 2, I in 4)
- S is banned from position 1.

Scanning common words:
- R I S E N – but N is forbidden.
- P I S T E – T is forbidden.
- C R I S E – but only 4 letters.
- P R I S E – but ends in E and contains S, I; P, R are still allowed.
- P R I S E – valid 5-letter word: PRISE.

Check constraints:
- Ends in E ✓
- Contains S and I ✓
- Doesn’t use L, A, T, H, N ✓
- S not in position 1 ✓
- I not in position 3 ✓

Therefore, PRISE is a valid next guess.

<guess>PRISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: PRISE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

1. Word ends in E (position 5).
2. Forbidden letters: L, A, T, H, N, P, R.
3. Letters still in the word but whose positions are unknown:
   - S – must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 1 or 5).
   - I – must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 3, because I(-) on PRISE means I is not in position 3; position 5 is E).

So far the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E with
   - S somewhere in positions 2-4
   - I somewhere in positions 2 or 4
   - No duplicates of S or I yet.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both S and I exactly once each, avoiding all forbidden letters (L, A, T, H, N, P, R).

Good remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I already used, U and O are still free.

Let’s place the known letters:

Option 1: I at 2, S at 3 or 4
   - _ I S _ E or _ I _ S E

Option 2: S at 2, I at 4
   - _ S _ I E

Try Option 1 first: _ I S _ E
   - C I S C E – invalid (C twice, but we have no info on C yet).
   - D I S C E – C is fine, but D, I, S, C, E – all letters allowed.
   - DISCE is not a valid English word.

   - V I S C E – valid? No.

   - F I S C E – no.

   - M I S C E – no.

Option 2: _ S _ I E
   - B U S I E – valid 5-letter word “BUISE”? No, not valid.

   - C O S I E – “COSIE” is valid (Scottish for cozy, but allowed in Wordle word lists).

   - D O S I E – “DOSIE” – no.

   - V O S I E – no.

   - F O S I E – no.

   - G O S I E – no.

   - K O S I E – no.

   - W O S I E – no.

“COSIE” is a valid 5-letter word in Wordle lists.

Check constraints:
- Ends in E ✓
- Contains S and I ✓
- S is in position 3 (allowed) ✓
- I is in position 4 (allowed) ✓
- Avoids forbidden letters L, A, T, H, N, P, R ✓

Therefore, COSIE is the next logical guess.

Guess 3: PRISE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(x) I(-) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 4: COSIE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) S(✓) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the whole history so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E is definitely in position 5 and fixed).
2. Letters never in the word: L, A, T, H, N, P, R, C, O.
3. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - S – now known to be in position 3 (feedback S(✓) in COSIE).
   - I – must be in the word (I(-) on PRISE and COSIE), yet COSIE shows I(-) which means I is not in position 4. Since it also cannot be in position 3 (S is there) or 5 (E), the only remaining possible positions for I are 1 or 2.

Therefore, the pattern so far is: _ I _ S E  or  I _ _ S E   (with S locked at position 3).

Allowed letters left (avoiding forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- _ I _ S E
   – D I B S E → “DIBSE” is not a valid word.
   – D I M S E → “DIMSE” is not a valid word.
   – D I K S E → “DIKSE” invalid.
   – D I V S E → invalid.
   – F I D S E → invalid.
   – G I D S E → invalid.
   – K I D S E → invalid.
   – V I D S E → invalid.
   – W I D S E → invalid.

- I _ _ S E
   – I D S E ? needs 5 letters: I D _ S E.
   – I D E S E – invalid (E used twice).
   – I D D S E – invalid (D twice).
   – I D I S E – invalid (I twice).
   – I D U S E → “IDUSE” – no.
   – I D G S E – no.

Wait, let’s try _ I _ S E again with letters we haven’t used:

 – M I D S E → “MIDSE” – no.
 – G I V E S – but S is at 3, not 5.
 – F I V E S – F, I, V, E, S – letters all allowed, S at 3: F I V S E – valid word “FIVES”.

Check:
- F, I, V, E, S all allowed.
- Pattern: F I V S E
- S at position 3 (confirmed ✓).
- I at position 2 (allowed).
- E at position 5 (confirmed).
- No forbidden letters included.

Therefore, FIVES is a valid next guess that satisfies all constraints.

Let's extract every constraint we have so far.

1. Position 5 is **E** (always ✓).

2. Letters **never** in the word (from previous x-feedback):
   L, A, T, H, N, P, R, C, O, F, V.

3. Letters **must** be in the word:
   - **S** – now known to be in position 3 (from COSIE: S ✓).
   - **I** – must appear somewhere (seen in I(-) on multiple guesses).  
     Positions ruled out for I:
        - 3 (occupied by S)  
        - 4 (I(-) on COSIE)  
        - 5 (E)  
        - 2 (I(-) on FIVES)  
     Therefore **I must be in position 1**.

So the only possible pattern is:  
I _ S _ E

Allowed letters left (avoiding the forbidden set and duplicates):  
B, D, G, K, M, U, W, Y (no repeats).

We need a 5-letter word matching I _ S _ E.

Valid dictionary words that fit:
- I D S A E – invalid (A forbidden)  
- I D S U E – not a word  
- I G S U E – not a word  
- I M S U E – not a word  
- I B S U E – not a word  
- I K S U E – not a word  
- I G S O E – O forbidden  
- I W S U E – not a word  
- I M S G E – not a word  
- I K S D E – not a word  

Continuing down the list of remaining consonants, the first recognizable valid word is:

I D S O E – invalid (O forbidden)  
I D S U E – still not a word.

Wait — how about “ISBNE”? no.  
Checking a compact list of English 5-letter words ending in “ISE” with an I at the start and an S in position 3, the only common word is **ISUSE**, but that’s not valid.

However, **ISBNE** etc. are not words, but **ISUSE** is invalid.

Actually, the only word that fits is **ISSUE**.

Check:
- Pattern: I _ S _ E → I S S U E  
- S is in position 3 (✓).  
- I is in position 1 (✓).  
- E is in position 5 (✓).  
- All letters allowed (S is allowed to repeat, and ISSUE uses S twice).  
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, H, N, P, R, C, O, F, V) are present.

Therefore, the unique remaining candidate is ISSUE.
