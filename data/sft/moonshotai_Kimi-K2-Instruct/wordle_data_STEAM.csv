For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible.

A popular and effective first guess is ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common)
- A (very common)
- I (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter)

This combination gives good coverage of common vowels and consonants, allowing us to quickly identify which of these letters are in the word and their potential positions.

From the first guess we learned:

- R is NOT in the word (R x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (A -).
- I is NOT in the word (I x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (S -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (E -).

So the mystery word definitely contains A, S, E, all in unknown positions.  
It also definitely does NOT contain R or I.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, S, E (with none of them in the positions they were just rejected from) and avoids R and I.

A quick way to cover new common letters is to look at the next most common ones not yet excluded: T, N, L, C, D, P, etc.

Let’s try “STEAL”:
- It has S, T, E, A, L.
- S is shifted to position 1 (allowed, since S was only rejected at position 4).
- A is shifted to position 3 (allowed, since A was rejected at position 2).
- E is shifted to position 3 (allowed, since E was rejected at position 5).
- T and L are fresh letters.

This seems like a solid second guess.

From the feedback so far we know the target word is of the form:

S T E A _

and the last letter is NOT K (from Guess 3) and also not L (from Guess 2).  
We still have these unused common letters for position 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, the most common that appear in English 5-letter words ending in “STEAK-style” endings are: M, N, D.

Checking valid 5-letter words:

- STEAM – fits all constraints (M unused, not excluded).  
- STEAN – valid but extremely obscure.  
- STEAD – valid word (D unused, not excluded).

Both STEAM and STEAD are common; STEAM uses the highly frequent M, so I’ll choose STEAM.
