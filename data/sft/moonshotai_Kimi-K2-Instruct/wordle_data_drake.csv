- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have frequently used letters to maximize information gain. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A and E are very common vowels.
- It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z, etc.
This should provide good feedback on letter positions and presence.

From the second guess GRATE we now know:

- G is not in the word (x).
- R is still ✓ in position 2.
- A is still ✓ in position 3.
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is still ✓ in position 5.

- Introduces new letters in positions 1 and 4.

Common letters left to try: S, L, B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y (avoiding the ruled-out ones).

Some candidate words:
- BRAVE – but V is new, B is new
- DRASE – but D would be position 4 and S position 1; however, S is common
- FRAME – F and M are new
- PRASE – P and S are new
- BRASE – B and S are new

Of these, “BRASE” seems good because:
- B and S are common and haven’t been tested.
- It fits the pattern _ R A _ E: B R A S E
- No forbidden letters.

But let me check: BRASE uses S in position 4 and E in position 5 (already correct). That would be B R A S E – yes, valid.

Another check: has any feedback shown S is not in the word? No, S hasn’t appeared yet. So BRASE is safe.

Alternatively, “FRASE” could work (F R A S E), but F is slightly less common than B.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,drake,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have frequently used letters to maximize information gain. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A and E are very common vowels.
- It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z, etc.
This should provide good feedback on letter positions and presence.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓)

So the pattern we know is _ R A _ E, and the letters not in the word are C and N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position.
2. Has A in the 3rd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Does not contain C or N.
5. Has distinct letters in the 1st and 4th positions (since we haven't seen those positions yet).

Possible candidates: BRAKE, GRATE, PRASE, TRADE, FRAGE, etc.

Among these, ""GRATE"" seems good because:
- It follows the pattern _ R A _ E (GRATE -> G R A T E)
- It introduces new common letters G and T
- Doesn't use C or N

<guess>GRATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: GRATE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the second guess GRATE we now know:

- G is not in the word (x).
- R is still ✓ in position 2.
- A is still ✓ in position 3.
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is still ✓ in position 5.

So the fixed pattern is _ R A _ E.
Letters already ruled out: C, N, G, T.

We need a word that:
- Has the pattern _ R A _ E
- Uses none of C, N, G, T
- Introduces new letters in positions 1 and 4.

Common letters left to try: S, L, B, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y (avoiding the ruled-out ones).

Some candidate words:
- BRAVE – but V is new, B is new
- DRASE – but D would be position 4 and S position 1; however, S is common
- FRAME – F and M are new
- PRASE – P and S are new
- BRASE – B and S are new

Of these, “BRASE” seems good because:
- B and S are common and haven’t been tested.
- It fits the pattern _ R A _ E: B R A S E
- No forbidden letters.

But let me check: BRASE uses S in position 4 and E in position 5 (already correct). That would be B R A S E – yes, valid.

Another check: has any feedback shown S is not in the word? No, S hasn’t appeared yet. So BRASE is safe.

Alternatively, “FRASE” could work (F R A S E), but F is slightly less common than B.

I’ll go with BRASE because B and S are both very common and untested.
