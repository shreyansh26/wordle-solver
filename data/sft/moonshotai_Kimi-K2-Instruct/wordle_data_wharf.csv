For the first guess, I want to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. Good starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage across different positions and help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters to exclude: S, L, T, E
- We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U, Y) and remaining consonants.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels
3. Avoid the excluded letters (S, L, T, E)

Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, R, W, plus vowels O, I, U, Y.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- Keeps A in position 3
- Tests C, R, N (common consonants)
- Tests E (though E was in SLATE and excluded, but E is position 5 here - wait, E was excluded entirely)
Correction: E was excluded (x), so avoid E.

Better choice: ""CRAIN"" - but that's not a valid word. 
Next: ""DRAIN"" - valid, tests D, R, I, N.
But A is position 3, so: D R A I N - that's 5 letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → ✗ S,L,T,E are NOT in the word. A is in position 3.
2. DRAIN → ✗ D,I,N are NOT in the word. R is in the word but not position 2.
3. CHARM → ✗ C,M are NOT in the word. H is in position 2, A in 3, R in 4 (all ✓ positions).

So the pattern is now: _ H A R _

Letters known to be absent: S, L, T, E, D, I, N, C, M  
Letters still possible: B, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus any we haven’t tried.

We need:
- Position 1: any letter not yet excluded.
- Position 5: any letter not yet excluded.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits _ H A R _ and only uses allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B H A R ? → BHARD, BHARS… none valid.
- F H A R ? → FHARD, FHARS… none.
- G H A R ? → GHARS isn’t valid.
- J H A R ? → JHARS isn’t valid.
- K H A R ? → KHARS isn’t valid.
- P H A R ? → PHARO (not 5), PHARM (M excluded).
- O H A R ? → OHARE isn’t valid.
- U H A R ? → UHARS isn’t valid.
- V H A R ? → VHARD, VHARS… none.
- W H A R ? → WHARF – valid 5-letter word.

Check WHARF:
- W: new, allowed.
- H: position 2 (matches ✓).
- A: position 3 (matches ✓).
- R: position 4 (matches ✓).
- F: new, allowed.

Thus, WHARF fits the pattern and only uses untested letters.
