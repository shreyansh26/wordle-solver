For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm them. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It has no repeated letters
3. It covers all vowels except U
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good feedback on whether these common letters are in the word or not.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R(x) means R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) means O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) means E is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 5).

So we know:
- Letters eliminated: R, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E
- We also know A is not in slot 1 and E is not in slot 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A and E, avoids R, O, S, and respects the positional constraints so far.  
Let’s look for a word that uses other very common letters (T, L, N, I, D, etc.) along with A and E.

A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It has both known letters A and E.
- It avoids R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters L, I, N.
- A is in slot 2 (not slot 1), E is in slot 4 (not slot 5) – both positions are safe so far.

   • Letters I and N are now also eliminated.

Known required letters so far: A, E, L  
Known forbidden letters: R, O, S, I, N  
Known positions that are still open for A, E, L:  
   – A cannot be 1 or 3 → it must be 2, 4, or 5  
   – E cannot be 4 or 5 → it must be 1, 2, or 3  
   – L cannot be 2 → it must be 1, 3, 4, or 5

We also need two more consonants that are not yet eliminated (cannot be R, O, S, N; nor any vowels that have been ruled out like I).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, C, G, B, F, H, M, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
   • Contains A, E, L  
   • Uses two fresh, still-possible consonants  
   • Respects the positional rules above.

A word like “LEAPT” would be invalid, because P is fine but T at the end is okay, but let’s be systematic.

Known required letters so far: A, E, L

   – L cannot be 2 → it must be 1, 3, 4, or 5

We also need two more consonants that are not yet eliminated (cannot be R, O, S, N; nor any vowels that have been ruled out like I).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, C, G, B, F, H, M, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
   • Contains A, E, L  
   • Uses two fresh, still-possible consonants  
   • Respects the positional rules above.

A word like “LEAPT” would be invalid, because P is fine but T at the end is okay, but let’s be systematic.

Candidate: TABLE  
   • Letters: T, A, B, L, E  
   • Contains required A, E, L  
   • Uses new consonants T and B (both still possible)  
   – A is in position 2 (allowed)  
   – E is in position 5 (but we know E cannot be in 5) — so TABLE is disallowed.

Candidate: BLEAT  
   • Letters: B, L, E, A, T  
   – A is in position 4 (allowed)  
   – E is in position 3 (allowed)  
   – L is in position 2 (forbidden because L cannot be in 2) — so BLEAT is out.

Candidate: LATTE — has two T’s, which we haven’t ruled out, but repeats T; also E at 5, forbidden.

Candidate: DEALT  
   • D, E, A, L, T  
   – A is in position 3 — but A cannot be in 3 (from ALIEN feedback) — so DEALT is out.

Candidate: LATED  
   • L, A, T, E, D  
   – A at 2 (allowed)  
   – E at 4 (forbidden) — so LATED is out.

Candidate: DELTA  
   • D, E, L, T, A  
   – A at 5 (allowed)  
   – E at 2 (allowed)  
   – L at 3 (allowed)  
   – Uses new consonants D and T, both still possible  
   – No forbidden letters (R, O, S, I, N absent)  
   – All required letters (A, E, L) present  
   – Positional constraints respected.

Therefore, DELTA is a valid next guess.

Let's consolidate the information from every guess so far.

Known letters
- Must be in the word: A, E, L  
- Must not be in the word: R, O, S, I, N, D, T

Known positions
- A is somewhere, but NOT positions 1, 3, or 5 (from AROSE/ALIEN/DELTA).  
  ⇒ A is in position 2 or 4.

- E is somewhere, but NOT positions 4 or 5 (from ALIEN/DELTA).  
  From DELTA we see E is in position 2.  
  ⇒ E is fixed in position 2 and we can write: _ E _ _ _

- L is somewhere, but NOT positions 2 or 3 (from ALIEN/DELTA).  
  Possible slots for L: 1, 4, 5.

Forbidden consonants so far: R, O, S, D, T, I, N  
Remaining usable consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y …

We have the skeleton:  
? E ? ? ?  
with A required in 2 or 4, but position 2 is already E, so A must be in 4.  
That gives: ? E ? A ?

And L must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).

Case 1 – L in position 1: L E ? A ?  
   We need one more consonant (not yet ruled out) for position 3.  
   Try C: LEACH (but H is allowed) – but H not yet eliminated.  
   Try G: LEGAL – but A already used once.  
   Try F: LEFAX – not a word.  
   Try B: LEB… – nothing obvious.  
   Try C: LECA? – LECAL not a word.  
   Maybe K: LEAK?  needs 5 letters.  
   Look for real 5-letter words:
   - L E B A ? – LEBAR isn’t valid.  
   - L E C A ? – LECAR not valid.  
   - L E G A ? – LEGAL is valid, but only 5 letters: L E G A L – double L ok, but L already placed in 1 and 5.  LEGAL is a valid word and uses allowed letters (E, G, A, L).  It keeps the unknown slot 3 as G which hasn’t been eliminated.

Case 2 – L in position 5: ? E ? A L  
   Need a consonant for positions 1 and 3.  
   Try B: B E G A L → BEGAL isn’t a word.

   Try B: B E C A L → BECAL not a word.  
   Try K: K E G A L → KEGAL not a word.  
   Among the valid ones, LEGAL and FECAL both fit the constraints, but LEGAL has a repeated L and does not give new info.  FECAL uses F and C which are still possible.

Let’s pick the cleanest word that uses fresh consonants and satisfies everything: FECAL.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm them. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It has no repeated letters
3. It covers all vowels except U
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good feedback on whether these common letters are in the word or not.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R(x) means R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) means O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) means E is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 5).

So we know:
- Letters eliminated: R, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E
- We also know A is not in slot 1 and E is not in slot 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A and E, avoids R, O, S, and respects the positional constraints so far.  
Let’s look for a word that uses other very common letters (T, L, N, I, D, etc.) along with A and E.

A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It has both known letters A and E.
- It avoids R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters L, I, N.
- A is in slot 2 (not slot 1), E is in slot 4 (not slot 5) – both positions are safe so far.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm them. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It has no repeated letters
3. It covers all vowels except U
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good feedback on whether these common letters are in the word or not.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 1).
- R(x) means R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) means O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) means S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) means E is in the word but in a different position (it’s not in slot 5).

So we know:
- Letters eliminated: R, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E
- We also know A is not in slot 1 and E is not in slot 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A and E, avoids R, O, S, and respects the positional constraints so far.  
Let’s look for a word that uses other very common letters (T, L, N, I, D, etc.) along with A and E.

A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It has both known letters A and E.
- It avoids R, O, S.
- It introduces new common letters L, I, N.
- A is in slot 2 (not slot 1), E is in slot 4 (not slot 5) – both positions are safe so far.

   • A exists but is NOT in position 1 (and not in position 3 from ALIEN)  
   • E exists but is NOT in position 5 (and not in position 4 from ALIEN)

Known required letters so far: A, E, L  
Known forbidden letters: R, O, S, I, N  
Known positions that are still open for A, E, L:  
   – A cannot be 1 or 3 → it must be 2, 4, or 5  
   – E cannot be 4 or 5 → it must be 1, 2, or 3  
   – L cannot be 2 → it must be 1, 3, 4, or 5

We also need two more consonants that are not yet eliminated (cannot be R, O, S, N; nor any vowels that have been ruled out like I).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, C, G, B, F, H, M, K, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
   • Contains A, E, L  
   • Uses two fresh, still-possible consonants  
   • Respects the positional rules above.

A word like “LEAPT” would be invalid, because P is fine but T at the end is okay, but let’s be systematic.

Candidate: TABLE  
   • Letters: T, A, B, L, E  
   • Contains required A, E, L  
   • Uses new consonants T and B (both still possible)  
   – A is in position 2 (allowed)  
   – E is in position 5 (but we know E cannot be in 5) — so TABLE is disallowed.

Candidate: BLEAT  
   • Letters: B, L, E, A, T  
   – A is in position 4 (allowed)  
   – E is in position 3 (allowed)  
   – L is in position 2 (forbidden because L cannot be in 2) — so BLEAT is out.

Candidate: LATTE — has two T’s, which we haven’t ruled out, but repeats T; also E at 5, forbidden.

Candidate: DEALT  
   • D, E, A, L, T  
   – A is in position 3 — but A cannot be in 3 (from ALIEN feedback) — so DEALT is out.

Candidate: LATED  
   • L, A, T, E, D  
   – A at 2 (allowed)  
   – E at 4 (forbidden) — so LATED is out.

Candidate: DELTA  
   • D, E, L, T, A  
   – A at 5 (allowed)  
   – E at 2 (allowed)  
   – L at 3 (allowed)  
   – Uses new consonants D and T, both still possible  
   – No forbidden letters (R, O, S, I, N absent)  
   – All required letters (A, E, L) present  
   – Positional constraints respected.

Therefore, DELTA is a valid next guess.

Known letters
- Must be in the word: A, E, L  
- Must not be in the word: R, O, S, I, N, D, T

Known positions
- A is somewhere, but NOT positions 1, 3, or 5 (from AROSE/ALIEN/DELTA).  
  ⇒ A is in position 2 or 4.

- E is somewhere, but NOT positions 4 or 5 (from ALIEN/DELTA).  
  From DELTA we see E is in position 2.  
  ⇒ E is fixed in position 2 and we can write: _ E _ _ _

- L is somewhere, but NOT positions 2 or 3 (from ALIEN/DELTA).  
  Possible slots for L: 1, 4, 5.

Forbidden consonants so far: R, O, S, D, T, I, N  
Remaining usable consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y …

We have the skeleton:  
? E ? ? ?  
with A required in 2 or 4, but position 2 is already E, so A must be in 4.  
That gives: ? E ? A ?

And L must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2,3,4).

Case 1 – L in position 1: L E ? A ?  
   We need one more consonant (not yet ruled out) for position 3.  
   Try C: LEACH (but H is allowed) – but H not yet eliminated.  
   Try G: LEGAL – but A already used once.  
   Try F: LEFAX – not a word.  
   Try B: LEB… – nothing obvious.  
   Try C: LECA? – LECAL not a word.  
   Maybe K: LEAK?  needs 5 letters.  
   Look for real 5-letter words:
   - L E B A ? – LEBAR isn’t valid.  
   - L E C A ? – LECAR not valid.  
   - L E G A ? – LEGAL is valid, but only 5 letters: L E G A L – double L ok, but L already placed in 1 and 5.  LEGAL is a valid word and uses allowed letters (E, G, A, L).  It keeps the unknown slot 3 as G which hasn’t been eliminated.

Case 2 – L in position 5: ? E ? A L  
   Need a consonant for positions 1 and 3.  
   Try B: B E G A L → BEGAL isn’t a word.  
   Try C: C E C A L → CECAL obscure.  
   Try G: G E N A L → GENAL uses N which is excluded.  
   Try H: H E C A L → HECAL not a word.  
   Try M: M E C A L → MECAL not valid.  
   Try F: F E C A L → FECAL is valid.  
   Try B: B E C A L → BECAL not a word.  
   Try K: K E G A L → KEGAL not a word.  
   Among the valid ones, LEGAL and FECAL both fit the constraints, but LEGAL has a repeated L and does not give new info.  FECAL uses F and C which are still possible.

Let’s pick the cleanest word that uses fresh consonants and satisfies everything: FECAL.

Check:
- Letters: F, E, C, A, L  
- Contains required A, E, L  
- No forbidden letters (no R,O,S,I,N,D,T)  
- Positions: _ E _ A L (L in position 5 allowed, E in 2 confirmed, A in 4 allowed).

From Guess 5 (LEGAL → L✓ E✓ Gx A- L-) we now have:

- Positions 1 & 2 are locked: L E _ _ _
- A is confirmed present, but not in slot 4 (it had (-) in LEGAL).  
  Earlier we already knew A is not in 1, 3, 5.  
  That leaves only slot 4 … but A was just flagged (-) in slot 4.  
  ⇒ A has no legal position left.  This is impossible, so our assumption chain must be wrong.

Let’s re-evaluate all constraints:

Known letters that must appear: A, E, L  
Known letters that must not appear: R, O, S, I, N, D, T, C, F, G  

Positions so far:
- E cannot be 4,5 and must be somewhere; from LEGAL we see E is in slot 2 → slot 2 = E
- A cannot be 1,3,5 (from earlier) and now also cannot be 4 (LEGAL feedback) → A has no possible slot.  This means our only possible conclusion is that the word must be L E _ A _ but A cannot go anywhere, so we must have missed another earlier deduction.

Recheck:  
After Guess 4 (FECAL) we had:
- E fixed in slot 2
- A must be in slot 4
- L must be in slot 1
- Slot 3 had to be a new consonant.

But LEGAL gave slot 4 A(-), contradicting the earlier deduction that slot 4 must be A.  
Hence the true word cannot contain A in slot 4, so our earlier conclusion that slot 4 must be A is wrong.  
The only remaining possibility is that the word starts with L E _ _ _ and contains both A and L somewhere else, but A and L must both appear.

With E in slot 2, L already in slot 1, and A must appear somewhere else, we need a pattern: L E ? ? ? with A and another L somewhere.  The only 5-letter word with two L’s and E in slot 2 and containing A is L E A L _ or L E _ A L, but simple dictionary scan gives:

L E A L _ → no common word  
L E _ A L → L E G A L already tried  
L E A _ L → L E A V L no  
L E A L _ → no  
L E _ L A → no

But we have eliminated G, C, etc.  The remaining consonants are B, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern L E _ A L with the remaining letters is L E V A L — not a word.  
L E H A L — no.  
L E M A L — no.  
L E B A L — no.  
L E K A L — no.

That leaves only one possibility: we must have missed that A can be in slot 3.  Earlier we believed A was eliminated from slot 3 by ALIEN feedback (A(-) in slot 2).  Actually, ALIEN gave A(-) meaning A is present but not in slot 2 — it did NOT eliminate slot 3.  So A could be in slot 3.

So re-evaluate positions for A:  
A can be 2,3,4,5 but cannot be 1, and from DELTA A(-) means not in 4, from LEGAL A(-) in slot 4 again is consistent.  From LEGAL L(-) means L is not in slot 5.  From earlier, L must be in 1,3,4 but cannot be in 2,3,5.  So L must be in slot 1.

Now we have: L E _ _ _  
We must place A and another L.  The only common word with these constraints is L E A L _ but no.  Actually, the word must be L E X A L — but X is allowed.  Let’s check L E V A L — no.  
Actually, the word must be L E X A L — but not a word.  

The only common word left is L E A V E — but V is allowed, E already used.  We need a word with A and L exactly once each plus E.  The only pattern left is L E A _ _ with A in slot 3.  Then we need another L somewhere — impossible.  Or _ E L _ A — no, L must be in 1.

The mistake is we concluded L must be in 1, but let’s re-list:

Summary after all 5 guesses:
- Must contain: A, E, L  
- Must NOT contain: R,O,S,I,N,D,T,C,F,G  
- E is fixed in slot 2 (from DELTA and LEGAL)  
- A cannot be in 1,4,5 (from 1,3,5) and from LEGAL A(-) in 4 confirms, so A must be in slot 3  
- L must appear but cannot be in 2,3,5 (from earlier) → L must be in slot 1 or 4.  
  Slot 4 is now taken by ?, so L must be in slot 1 or 4.  
  But A is in slot 3, E in 2, so possible patterns:  
  L E A _ _  or _ E _ A L (but slot 1 must be L or the other letter).  

Let’s try L E A _ _  
We need one more letter, must be a consonant not yet eliminated (B, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).  
We need a word: L E A _ _ with one of these consonants.  
LEAFY — but Y is ok, F eliminated.  
LEAKY — K is ok, Y ok  
LEA **V** E — but V and E already used.  
LEA **P** — LEAPS is 5 letters.  
LEA **P** → LEAP?  too short.  

The only common 5-letter word fitting L E A _ _ is LEAKY.  
Check letters: L, E, A, K, Y — all allowed, no previously eliminated letters.  
Positions:  
L(1) E(2) A(3) K(4) Y(5)  
- A is in slot 3 — allowed  
- L is in slot 1 — allowed  
- E is in slot 2 — matches earlier lock  
- K and Y not eliminated.

Hence LEAKY is the only viable guess remaining.

<guess>LEAKY</guess>",LEAKY,"From Guess 5 (LEGAL → L✓ E✓ Gx A- L-) we now have:

- Positions 1 & 2 are locked: L E _ _ _
- A is confirmed present, but not in slot 4 (it had (-) in LEGAL).  
  Earlier we already knew A is not in 1, 3, 5.  
  That leaves only slot 4 … but A was just flagged (-) in slot 4.  
  ⇒ A has no legal position left.  This is impossible, so our assumption chain must be wrong.

Let’s re-evaluate all constraints:

Known letters that must appear: A, E, L  
Known letters that must not appear: R, O, S, I, N, D, T, C, F, G  

Positions so far:
- E cannot be 4,5 and must be somewhere; from LEGAL we see E is in slot 2 → slot 2 = E
- A cannot be 1,3,5 (from earlier) and now also cannot be 4 (LEGAL feedback) → A has no possible slot.  This means our only possible conclusion is that the word must be L E _ A _ but A cannot go anywhere, so we must have missed another earlier deduction.

Recheck:  
After Guess 4 (FECAL) we had:
- E fixed in slot 2
- A must be in slot 4
- L must be in slot 1
- Slot 3 had to be a new consonant.

But LEGAL gave slot 4 A(-), contradicting the earlier deduction that slot 4 must be A.  
Hence the true word cannot contain A in slot 4, so our earlier conclusion that slot 4 must be A is wrong.  
The only remaining possibility is that the word starts with L E _ _ _ and contains both A and L somewhere else, but A and L must both appear.

With E in slot 2, L already in slot 1, and A must appear somewhere else, we need a pattern: L E ? ? ? with A and another L somewhere.  The only 5-letter word with two L’s and E in slot 2 and containing A is L E A L _ or L E _ A L, but simple dictionary scan gives:

L E A L _ → no common word  
L E _ A L → L E G A L already tried  
L E A _ L → L E A V L no  
L E A L _ → no  
L E _ L A → no

But we have eliminated G, C, etc.  The remaining consonants are B, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern L E _ A L with the remaining letters is L E V A L — not a word.  
L E H A L — no.  
L E M A L — no.  
L E B A L — no.  
L E K A L — no.

That leaves only one possibility: we must have missed that A can be in slot 3.  Earlier we believed A was eliminated from slot 3 by ALIEN feedback (A(-) in slot 2).  Actually, ALIEN gave A(-) meaning A is present but not in slot 2 — it did NOT eliminate slot 3.  So A could be in slot 3.

So re-evaluate positions for A:  
A can be 2,3,4,5 but cannot be 1, and from DELTA A(-) means not in 4, from LEGAL A(-) in slot 4 again is consistent.  From LEGAL L(-) means L is not in slot 5.  From earlier, L must be in 1,3,4 but cannot be in 2,3,5.  So L must be in slot 1.

Now we have: L E _ _ _  
We must place A and another L.  The only common word with these constraints is L E A L _ but no.  Actually, the word must be L E X A L — but X is allowed.  Let’s check L E V A L — no.  
Actually, the word must be L E X A L — but not a word.  

The only common word left is L E A V E — but V is allowed, E already used.  We need a word with A and L exactly once each plus E.  The only pattern left is L E A _ _ with A in slot 3.  Then we need another L somewhere — impossible.  Or _ E L _ A — no, L must be in 1.

The mistake is we concluded L must be in 1, but let’s re-list:

Summary after all 5 guesses:
- Must contain: A, E, L  
- Must NOT contain: R,O,S,I,N,D,T,C,F,G  
- E is fixed in slot 2 (from DELTA and LEGAL)  
- A cannot be in 1,4,5 (from 1,3,5) and from LEGAL A(-) in 4 confirms, so A must be in slot 3  
- L must appear but cannot be in 2,3,5 (from earlier) → L must be in slot 1 or 4.  
  Slot 4 is now taken by ?, so L must be in slot 1 or 4.  
  But A is in slot 3, E in 2, so possible patterns:  
  L E A _ _  or _ E _ A L (but slot 1 must be L or the other letter).  

Let’s try L E A _ _  
We need one more letter, must be a consonant not yet eliminated (B, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).  
We need a word: L E A _ _ with one of these consonants.  
LEAFY — but Y is ok, F eliminated.  
LEAKY — K is ok, Y ok  
LEA **V** E — but V and E already used.  
LEA **P** — LEAPS is 5 letters.  
LEA **P** → LEAP?  too short.  

The only common 5-letter word fitting L E A _ _ is LEAKY.  
Check letters: L, E, A, K, Y — all allowed, no previously eliminated letters.  
Positions:  
L(1) E(2) A(3) K(4) Y(5)  
- A is in slot 3 — allowed  
- L is in slot 1 — allowed  
- E is in slot 2 — matches earlier lock  
- K and Y not eliminated.

Hence LEAKY is the only viable guess remaining.",Guess 6: LEAKY -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL
