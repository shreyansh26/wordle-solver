Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that efficiently tests common letters in English. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. I want to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible to maximize information gain.

Good options would include words like ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E), ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E), or ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E). Among these, ""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes 5 of the most common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

- I: x → not in the word at all  
- S: x → not in the word at all

Current facts:
- Word contains A and E (but neither is in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 from feedback so far).
- Word does NOT contain R, I, S, O, C, N.

That leaves only positions 1 and 4 or 1 and 5 as possible placements for A and E, because:
- Position 2 is ruled out for both A and E.
- Position 3 is ruled out for E (from Guess 2).
- Position 4 is ruled out for A (from Guess 2).
- Position 5 is ruled out for E (from Guess 1).

So:
- A must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 2,4,5 ruled out for A, so only 1 and 3 possible).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 2,3,5 ruled out for E, so only 1 and 4 possible).

Since A and E can’t both be in position 1, the only valid placements are:
- A in 1, E in 4, or
- A in 3, E in 1, or
- A in 3, E in 4, etc.

But we need to test a word that puts A in a new position (not 2 or 4) and E in a new position (not 3 or 5), and incorporates new consonants from remaining common letters (T, L, D, B, G, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “MEGAP”:
- M (new consonant)
- E (moved to position 2, which is allowed)
- G (new consonant)
- A (moved to position 4, but 4 was ruled out for A in Guess 2 feedback)
Wait – A in position 4 was already checked in OCEAN and marked wrong, so A cannot be in position 4.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- E is in position 2.
- A is in position 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- R, I, S, O, C, N, D, T.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
- B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 3 (DEALT):
- L: (-) appears in word but is in wrong position. Since it's in position 4 in DEALT, L must be in positions 1, 5 (positions 2,3 are already E,A).

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown letter (must be one of allowed letters, and could be L)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: unknown (cannot be L, since L is in wrong position here)
- Position 5: unknown (could be L)

Also, L must appear exactly once in the word (since it got the ""-"" feedback).

Candidate words fitting _ E A _ _ with L appearing once:
- LEASH: H is allowed, S is excluded.
- PEACH: C is excluded.
- BEACH: B is allowed, C excluded.
- HEAPS: H, P, S - S excluded.
- MEANT: N, T excluded.
- FEAST: F allowed, S excluded.
- YEAST: Y allowed, S excluded.

Looking at these, ""BEACH"" is invalid (C excluded), ""HEAPS"" invalid (S), ""YEAST"" invalid (S), ""MEANT"" invalid (N,T). 

Let's think systematically:
Pattern: ? E A ? ? with L appearing once and no D,T,S,R,I,O,C,N.

Possible structures:
1. L is in position 1: L E A ? ?
   Possible endings: need 2 letters from allowed set, no repeats.
   LEAFY: F,Y allowed
   LEAKY: K,Y allowed
   LEAPT: P allowed, T excluded
   LEARN: N excluded
   LEASH: S excluded
   LEAVE: V allowed
   So possible: LEAFY, LEAKY, LEAVE.

2. L is in position 5: ? E A ? L
   Letters left: positions 1 and 4 must be from allowed set.
   B E A R L: R excluded
   F E A R L: R excluded
   G E A R L: R excluded
   H E A R L: R excluded
   J E A R L: R excluded
   K E A R L: R excluded
   M E A R L: R excluded
   P E A R L: R excluded
   U E A R L: R excluded
   V E A R L: R excluded
   W E A R L: R excluded
   Y E A R L: R excluded
   Hmm, no good with R excluded. Need other combinations.

   G E A L L: L repeated, invalid
   H E A V L: not a word
   M E A L Y: Y allowed, but L is already used in position 4 (from DEALT feedback L is in wrong position - here it's 4, which was wrong in DEALT, so allowed)
   MEALY: M,E,A,L,Y - L is in position 4, which is allowed since it was wrong in position 4 in DEALT but could be correct elsewhere.
   But MEALY has L in position 4, which is new, but we have A in position 3, E in 2, so M E A L Y fits pattern.

But let's check LEAFY, LEAKY, LEAVE, MEALY.

LEAFY: letters F,Y allowed, structure L E A F Y - valid.
LEAKY: K,Y allowed, structure L E A K Y - valid.
LEAVE: V allowed, structure L E A V E - but E is already in position 2, so double E may be possible but unlikely in 5-letter word.
MEALY: M,E,A,L,Y - fits _ E A _ _ with L in position 4.

But from DEALT feedback, L was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. Therefore MEALY is invalid.

Thus best candidate is LEAFY or LEAKY.

LEAFY is a valid word.

<guess>LEAFY</guess>",LEAFY,"Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- E is in position 2.
- A is in position 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- R, I, S, O, C, N, D, T.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
- B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 3 (DEALT):
- L: (-) appears in word but is in wrong position. Since it's in position 4 in DEALT, L must be in positions 1, 5 (positions 2,3 are already E,A).

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown letter (must be one of allowed letters, and could be L)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: unknown (cannot be L, since L is in wrong position here)
- Position 5: unknown (could be L)

Also, L must appear exactly once in the word (since it got the ""-"" feedback).

Candidate words fitting _ E A _ _ with L appearing once:
- LEASH: H is allowed, S is excluded.
- PEACH: C is excluded.
- BEACH: B is allowed, C excluded.
- HEAPS: H, P, S - S excluded.
- MEANT: N, T excluded.
- FEAST: F allowed, S excluded.
- YEAST: Y allowed, S excluded.

Looking at these, ""BEACH"" is invalid (C excluded), ""HEAPS"" invalid (S), ""YEAST"" invalid (S), ""MEANT"" invalid (N,T). 

Let's think systematically:
Pattern: ? E A ? ? with L appearing once and no D,T,S,R,I,O,C,N.

Possible structures:
1. L is in position 1: L E A ? ?

   LEAFY: F,Y allowed
   LEAKY: K,Y allowed
   LEAPT: P allowed, T excluded
   LEARN: N excluded

   LEAVE: V allowed
   So possible: LEAFY, LEAKY, LEAVE.

2. L is in position 5: ? E A ? L
   Letters left: positions 1 and 4 must be from allowed set.
   B E A R L: R excluded
   F E A R L: R excluded
   G E A R L: R excluded
   H E A R L: R excluded

   W E A R L: R excluded
   Y E A R L: R excluded
   Hmm, no good with R excluded. Need other combinations.

   G E A L L: L repeated, invalid
   H E A V L: not a word
   M E A L Y: Y allowed, but L is already used in position 4 (from DEALT feedback L is in wrong position - here it's 4, which was wrong in DEALT, so allowed)
   MEALY: M,E,A,L,Y - L is in position 4, which is allowed since it was wrong in position 4 in DEALT but could be correct elsewhere.
   But MEALY has L in position 4, which is new, but we have A in position 3, E in 2, so M E A L Y fits pattern.

But let's check LEAFY, LEAKY, LEAVE, MEALY.

LEAFY: letters F,Y allowed, structure L E A F Y - valid.
LEAKY: K,Y allowed, structure L E A K Y - valid.
LEAVE: V allowed, structure L E A V E - but E is already in position 2, so double E may be possible but unlikely in 5-letter word.
MEALY: M,E,A,L,Y - fits _ E A _ _ with L in position 4.

But from DEALT feedback, L was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. Therefore MEALY is invalid.

Thus best candidate is LEAFY or LEAKY.
