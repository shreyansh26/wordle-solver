Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

I want to cover as many of these as possible. One good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me coverage of 5 distinct common letters, which should provide good feedback.

- ""DOBBY"" – D O B B Y – but B is allowed, Y is allowed

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

I want to cover as many of these as possible. One good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me coverage of 5 distinct common letters, which should provide good feedback.

C(x) – C is NOT in the word  
R(x) – R is NOT in the word  
A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
N(✓) – N is in the correct position (position 4)  
E(x) – E is NOT in the word  

So the secret word has:
- N in position 4  
- No C, R, A, or E anywhere  

My next step is to pick a word that:
1. Keeps N in the 4th slot.  
2. Avoids any of C, R, A, E.  
3. Uses other common letters (especially vowels and consonants not yet ruled out) so I can learn as much as possible.

Common remaining letters to test: L, I, O, U, S, T, H, D, G, B, M, P, Y, F, K, etc.

A good candidate word that satisfies these constraints is “SOUND”:
- S – common consonant  
- O – common vowel  
- U – common vowel  
- N – already confirmed at position 4  
- D – common consonant  

None of S, O, U, D have been ruled out, and the word keeps N in the 4th position.

Summary of what we now know:

- Fixed letters and positions:
  1: D  
  2: O  
  4: N  

- Known non-letters (so far): C, R, A, E, S, U, I, G, T

- Position 5 has NOT been shown to be T (just ruled out).

- Position 3 was just confirmed to be W (✓).

So the word is: D O W N _

Only the final letter is unknown.

Letters we are still allowed to use (common ones) that have not been ruled out:
B, F, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Looking for valid English 5-letter words that start with “DOWN”:

DOWNY – “y” is allowed and not yet tested.  
DOWNB – not a word.  
DOWNH – not a word.  
DOWNP – not a word.  
DOWNL – not a word.

The only common 5-letter word matching D O W N _ is DOWNY.
