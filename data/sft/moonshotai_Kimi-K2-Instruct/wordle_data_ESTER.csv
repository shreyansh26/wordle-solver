For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- SLANT
- CRISP
- TRAIN

These words use letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a popular starting choice that includes the vowels A and E, and common consonants C, R, and N.

Current information:

1. Letters not in the word at all: C, A, N, O.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far:
   - R (present, not in position 2 or 4 or 5)
   - E (present, not in position 5 or 2)
   - S (present, not in position 1)
   - T (present, not in position 2)

3. Therefore the word must contain: R, E, S, T.
4. Since we have four confirmed letters, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining common letters (I, U, D, L, M, P, etc.).

5. We also know positions each letter CANNOT be:
   - R ≠ 2,4,5 → possible positions: 1 or 3
   - E ≠ 2,5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - S ≠ 1 → possible positions: 2,3,4,5
   - T ≠ 2 → possible positions: 1,3,4,5

6. We need a 5-letter word that uses R, E, S, T plus one more letter, fitting these constraints.

7. Possible candidates:
   - TREES (but E is repeated and we only know one E exists)
   - STEER (E appears twice)
   - STREP (contains P, which we haven't tested)
   - STREW (contains W, which we haven't tested)
   - TIERS (but we don't know about I)
   - TRUES (U hasn’t been tested)

8. Among these, “STREP” seems good: it uses the four confirmed letters plus P (a new consonant) and fits the positional constraints:
   - S not at 1 → S is at 1 in “STREP”? No, that fails S≠1.
   Actually “STREP” has S at 1, which conflicts with feedback S(-) in guess 2 where S was at 1. So “STREP” is invalid.

9. “STEER” has E twice and S at 1 → invalid (S cannot be at 1).

10. “TIERS” has S at 5: allowed (S ≠1), T at 1, I is new, E at 3, R at 4. Check constraints:
    - R is at 4. From feedback R is in word but not at 4 → invalid.

11. “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), E at 3, S at 5. R at 2 is invalid.

12. “TREES”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

13. “RESET”:
    - R at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid, E≠2), etc.

14. “REIST” isn’t a valid word.

15. “STURE” isn’t valid.

16. “STERE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid), etc.

17. “STIPE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

18. “STOPE”:
    - O is excluded.

19. “STELE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

20. “STIME”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

21. Perhaps we need to try placing R at 3:
   - E can be at 1 or 4 then.
   - Let’s try E at 1, R at 3:
      - _ E _ R _
      - We have S and T left to place in positions 2,4,5 with S≠1, T≠2.
      - Possible arrangement: S E T R ? but then we need a fifth letter.
      - Actually we have S,T,E,R already, so positions:
        - If we have E at 1, R at 3, then S and T must be at 2,4,5 with constraints T≠2, S≠1.
        - Example: E S T R ? but that’s only 4 letters.
        - Wait, we need to use all four letters S,T,R,E plus one more.

22. A valid word fitting all constraints is “STERN”:
    - S at 1 (invalid, S≠1).

23. “TERSE”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid), R at 3 (allowed), S at 4, E at 5 (invalid).

24. “TRESS”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

25. Let’s try placing R at 1:
   - Then E must be at 3 or 4 (since E≠2,5).
   - S must be at 2,3,4,5 with S≠1.
   - T must be at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2.
   - Possible word: R E S T _ but that’s only 4 letters. Need 5.

26. Actually, we need to use all four letters R,E,S,T plus one new letter.
   - Possible word: T E R S + new letter, but need to fit positions.

27. A valid word is “STEER” but invalid due to E twice and S at 1.

28. After reconsidering, the constraints are:
   - Word has R, E, S, T and one more letter (let’s call it X).
   - Possible positions:
     - R can be 1 or 3
     - E can be 1,3,4
     - S can be 2,3,4,5
     - T can be 1,3,4,5

29. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4:
   - Then positions: _ _ R E _
   - S and T must be at 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible word: T S R E ? but need fifth letter.
   - Actually we have T,S,R,E plus X.
   - Example: T S R E X → not a word.

30. Try R at 3, E at 1:
   - E _ R _ _
   - S and T must be at 2,4,5 with:
     - S ≠1 (ok), T ≠2 → T at 4 or 5
     - Possible: E S R T ? → not a word.

31. Try R at 1:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - E must be at 3 or 4
   - S at 2,3,4,5, T at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2
   - Example: R E S T ? → “RESTS” but S is repeated and we don’t know about second S.
   - “RESTO” – O is excluded.
   - “RESTY” – Y is uncommon.
   - “REEST” – invalid.

32. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4, and fifth letter L:
   - _ _ R E L
   - Need S and T in positions 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible: T S R E L → “TSREL” – invalid.
   - S T R E L → “STREL” – invalid.

33. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter D:
   - _ _ R E D
   - S and T at 1,2,5:
     - T S R E D → “TSRED” – invalid.
     - S T R E D → “STRED” – invalid.

34. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter P:
   - _ _ R E P
   - S T R E P → “STREP” but S at 1 → invalid.

35. Try R at 1, E at 3:
   - R _ E _ _
   - S and T at 2,4,5 with T≠2:
     - T cannot be at 2, so T at 4 or 5
     - Example: R S E T ? → “RSETO” – invalid.
     - R S E _ T → “RSEPT” – invalid.

36. Re-evaluate: we have R, E, S, T and need one more letter. Perhaps the word is “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), etc.

37. “TIRES”:
    - T at 1, I is new, R at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (allowed).
    - Check all constraints:
      - R is at 3 – allowed (R not at 2,4,5)
      - E is at 4 – allowed (E not at 2,5)
      - S is at 5 – allowed (S not at 1)
      - T is at 1 – allowed (T not at 2)
    - No excluded letters used.
    - “TIRES” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “TIRES”.

   - Then E must be at 3 or 4 (since E≠2,5).
   - S must be at 2,3,4,5 with S≠1.
   - T must be at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2.
   - Possible word: R E S T _ but that’s only 4 letters. Need 5.

26. Actually, we need to use all four letters R,E,S,T plus one new letter.
   - Possible word: T E R S + new letter, but need to fit positions.

27. A valid word is “STEER” but invalid due to E twice and S at 1.

28. After reconsidering, the constraints are:
   - Word has R, E, S, T and one more letter (let’s call it X).
   - Possible positions:
     - R can be 1 or 3
     - E can be 1,3,4
     - S can be 2,3,4,5
     - T can be 1,3,4,5

29. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4:
   - Then positions: _ _ R E _
   - S and T must be at 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible word: T S R E ? but need fifth letter.
   - Actually we have T,S,R,E plus X.
   - Example: T S R E X → not a word.

30. Try R at 3, E at 1:
   - E _ R _ _
   - S and T must be at 2,4,5 with:
     - S ≠1 (ok), T ≠2 → T at 4 or 5
     - Possible: E S R T ? → not a word.

31. Try R at 1:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - E must be at 3 or 4
   - S at 2,3,4,5, T at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2
   - Example: R E S T ? → “RESTS” but S is repeated and we don’t know about second S.
   - “RESTO” – O is excluded.
   - “RESTY” – Y is uncommon.
   - “REEST” – invalid.

32. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4, and fifth letter L:
   - _ _ R E L
   - Need S and T in positions 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible: T S R E L → “TSREL” – invalid.
   - S T R E L → “STREL” – invalid.

33. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter D:
   - _ _ R E D
   - S and T at 1,2,5:
     - T S R E D → “TSRED” – invalid.
     - S T R E D → “STRED” – invalid.

34. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter P:
   - _ _ R E P
   - S T R E P → “STREP” but S at 1 → invalid.

35. Try R at 1, E at 3:
   - R _ E _ _
   - S and T at 2,4,5 with T≠2:
     - T cannot be at 2, so T at 4 or 5
     - Example: R S E T ? → “RSETO” – invalid.
     - R S E _ T → “RSEPT” – invalid.

36. Re-evaluate: we have R, E, S, T and need one more letter. Perhaps the word is “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), etc.

37. “TIRES”:
    - T at 1, I is new, R at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (allowed).
    - Check all constraints:
      - R is at 3 – allowed (R not at 2,4,5)
      - E is at 4 – allowed (E not at 2,5)
      - S is at 5 – allowed (S not at 1)
      - T is at 1 – allowed (T not at 2)
    - No excluded letters used.
    - “TIRES” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “TIRES”.",Guess 3: TIRES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,ESTER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- SLANT
- CRISP
- TRAIN

These words use letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a popular starting choice that includes the vowels A and E, and common consonants C, R, and N.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains R somewhere other than position 2.
- The word contains E somewhere other than position 5.
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

Good letters to try next include common consonants and the remaining vowels. We still need to test letters like S, T, L, O, I, etc. A reasonable second guess is “STORE”:
- It keeps R and E from the previous guess and moves them to new positions.
- Adds S, T, O to test new common letters.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

<guess>STORE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

1. Letters not in the word at all: C, A, N, O.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far:
   - R (present, not in position 2 or 4 or 5)
   - E (present, not in position 5 or 2)
   - S (present, not in position 1)
   - T (present, not in position 2)

3. Therefore the word must contain: R, E, S, T.
4. Since we have four confirmed letters, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining common letters (I, U, D, L, M, P, etc.).

5. We also know positions each letter CANNOT be:
   - R ≠ 2,4,5 → possible positions: 1 or 3
   - E ≠ 2,5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - S ≠ 1 → possible positions: 2,3,4,5
   - T ≠ 2 → possible positions: 1,3,4,5

6. We need a 5-letter word that uses R, E, S, T plus one more letter, fitting these constraints.

7. Possible candidates:
   - TREES (but E is repeated and we only know one E exists)
   - STEER (E appears twice)
   - STREP (contains P, which we haven't tested)
   - STREW (contains W, which we haven't tested)
   - TIERS (but we don't know about I)
   - TRUES (U hasn’t been tested)

8. Among these, “STREP” seems good: it uses the four confirmed letters plus P (a new consonant) and fits the positional constraints:
   - S not at 1 → S is at 1 in “STREP”? No, that fails S≠1.
   Actually “STREP” has S at 1, which conflicts with feedback S(-) in guess 2 where S was at 1. So “STREP” is invalid.

9. “STEER” has E twice and S at 1 → invalid (S cannot be at 1).

10. “TIERS” has S at 5: allowed (S ≠1), T at 1, I is new, E at 3, R at 4. Check constraints:
    - R is at 4. From feedback R is in word but not at 4 → invalid.

11. “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), E at 3, S at 5. R at 2 is invalid.

12. “TREES”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

13. “RESET”:
    - R at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid, E≠2), etc.

14. “REIST” isn’t a valid word.

15. “STURE” isn’t valid.

16. “STERE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid), etc.

17. “STIPE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

18. “STOPE”:
    - O is excluded.

19. “STELE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

20. “STIME”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

21. Perhaps we need to try placing R at 3:
   - E can be at 1 or 4 then.
   - Let’s try E at 1, R at 3:
      - _ E _ R _
      - We have S and T left to place in positions 2,4,5 with S≠1, T≠2.
      - Possible arrangement: S E T R ? but then we need a fifth letter.
      - Actually we have S,T,E,R already, so positions:
        - If we have E at 1, R at 3, then S and T must be at 2,4,5 with constraints T≠2, S≠1.
        - Example: E S T R ? but that’s only 4 letters.
        - Wait, we need to use all four letters S,T,R,E plus one more.

22. A valid word fitting all constraints is “STERN”:
    - S at 1 (invalid, S≠1).

23. “TERSE”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid), R at 3 (allowed), S at 4, E at 5 (invalid).

24. “TRESS”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

25. Let’s try placing R at 1:
   - Then E must be at 3 or 4 (since E≠2,5).
   - S must be at 2,3,4,5 with S≠1.
   - T must be at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2.
   - Possible word: R E S T _ but that’s only 4 letters. Need 5.

26. Actually, we need to use all four letters R,E,S,T plus one new letter.
   - Possible word: T E R S + new letter, but need to fit positions.

27. A valid word is “STEER” but invalid due to E twice and S at 1.

28. After reconsidering, the constraints are:
   - Word has R, E, S, T and one more letter (let’s call it X).
   - Possible positions:
     - R can be 1 or 3
     - E can be 1,3,4
     - S can be 2,3,4,5
     - T can be 1,3,4,5

29. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4:
   - Then positions: _ _ R E _
   - S and T must be at 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible word: T S R E ? but need fifth letter.
   - Actually we have T,S,R,E plus X.
   - Example: T S R E X → not a word.

30. Try R at 3, E at 1:
   - E _ R _ _
   - S and T must be at 2,4,5 with:
     - S ≠1 (ok), T ≠2 → T at 4 or 5
     - Possible: E S R T ? → not a word.

31. Try R at 1:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - E must be at 3 or 4
   - S at 2,3,4,5, T at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2
   - Example: R E S T ? → “RESTS” but S is repeated and we don’t know about second S.
   - “RESTO” – O is excluded.
   - “RESTY” – Y is uncommon.
   - “REEST” – invalid.

32. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4, and fifth letter L:
   - _ _ R E L
   - Need S and T in positions 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible: T S R E L → “TSREL” – invalid.
   - S T R E L → “STREL” – invalid.

33. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter D:
   - _ _ R E D
   - S and T at 1,2,5:
     - T S R E D → “TSRED” – invalid.
     - S T R E D → “STRED” – invalid.

34. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter P:
   - _ _ R E P
   - S T R E P → “STREP” but S at 1 → invalid.

35. Try R at 1, E at 3:
   - R _ E _ _
   - S and T at 2,4,5 with T≠2:
     - T cannot be at 2, so T at 4 or 5
     - Example: R S E T ? → “RSETO” – invalid.
     - R S E _ T → “RSEPT” – invalid.

36. Re-evaluate: we have R, E, S, T and need one more letter. Perhaps the word is “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), etc.

37. “TIRES”:
    - T at 1, I is new, R at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (allowed).
    - Check all constraints:
      - R is at 3 – allowed (R not at 2,4,5)
      - E is at 4 – allowed (E not at 2,5)
      - S is at 5 – allowed (S not at 1)
      - T is at 1 – allowed (T not at 2)
    - No excluded letters used.
    - “TIRES” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “TIRES”.

From the new feedback on TIRES:

4. E(✓) – E is **correct in position 4**.
5. S(-) – S is in the word but **not in position 5**.
   (Previously S ≠ 1; now also S ≠ 5.)

Letters confirmed in the word so far: R, E (in position 4), S, T.

Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, I.

Positions so far:
- R can only be in position 1 (since 2,3,4,5 are all ruled out).
- T can be in positions 3 or 4 or 5, but 4 is already E, so T can be 3 or 5.
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 or 4, but 4 is E, so S can be 2 or 3.
- The fifth position must be filled with a letter not yet used (and not excluded); remaining common candidates: D, L, M, P, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 1.
- Has E in position 4.
- Has T in 3 or 5.
- Has S in 2 or 3.
- Adds one new letter (not C, A, N, O, I).

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Case 1: T in position 3
- R _ T E _
- S must then be in position 2 or 5. Since 5 is left, if S is in 2: R S T E _ (needs fifth letter).
  Candidates:
  - R S T E D  → “RSTED” (invalid)
  - R S T E L  → “RSTEL” (invalid)
  - R S T E M  → “RSTEM” (invalid)
  No valid words.

If S is in 5:
- R _ T E S → needs letter in 2: “R?TES”
  Possible: R D T E S (invalid), R L T E S (invalid), R P T E S (invalid).

Case 2: T in position 5
- R _ _ E T
- S must be in 2 or 3.
  - S in 2: R S _ E T → needs letter in 3, common consonants: D, L, M, P

    - R M S E T (invalid)
    - R P S E T (invalid)

Wait – “R” fixed in position 1 is the only remaining possibility, but none of the above combinations form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Actually, the only valid common English 5-letter words fitting R _ _ E _ with S and T remaining are extremely limited. One valid word that satisfies:

- R in 1
- E in 4
- uses S and T
- adds a new letter D:

The word “R E S T _” doesn’t fit because E is in 4. The only real word is “R E S E T” but that has E twice and we already have E in 4.

Another candidate: “R A S T E” has A which is excluded.

Wait – we have R, S, T, E plus one new letter. The only real word fitting is “R E S T _” but that’s impossible because E must be in 4.

Recheck: positions must be:

- 1: R
- 2: ?
- 3: ?
- 4: E

We need S and T in 2,3,5 and the fifth letter.

Possible valid word: “R E S E T” – but E is repeated and we don’t know about second E.

Another valid word: “R E S T O” – O excluded.

“R E S T S” – S repeated, not likely.

Wait – “R E S T Y” (invalid).

Realizing now the only valid English word meeting all constraints is “R E S E T” – even though it repeats E, it is the only common word. Since we have no indication against a second E, and we must use R,S,T,E:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ESTER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- SLANT
- CRISP
- TRAIN

These words use letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a popular starting choice that includes the vowels A and E, and common consonants C, R, and N.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains R somewhere other than position 2.
- The word contains E somewhere other than position 5.
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

Good letters to try next include common consonants and the remaining vowels. We still need to test letters like S, T, L, O, I, etc. A reasonable second guess is “STORE”:
- It keeps R and E from the previous guess and moves them to new positions.
- Adds S, T, O to test new common letters.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

1. Letters not in the word at all: C, A, N, O.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far:
   - R (present, not in position 2 or 4 or 5)
   - E (present, not in position 5 or 2)
   - S (present, not in position 1)
   - T (present, not in position 2)

3. Therefore the word must contain: R, E, S, T.
4. Since we have four confirmed letters, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining common letters (I, U, D, L, M, P, etc.).

5. We also know positions each letter CANNOT be:
   - R ≠ 2,4,5 → possible positions: 1 or 3
   - E ≠ 2,5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - S ≠ 1 → possible positions: 2,3,4,5
   - T ≠ 2 → possible positions: 1,3,4,5

6. We need a 5-letter word that uses R, E, S, T plus one more letter, fitting these constraints.

7. Possible candidates:
   - TREES (but E is repeated and we only know one E exists)
   - STEER (E appears twice)
   - STREP (contains P, which we haven't tested)
   - STREW (contains W, which we haven't tested)
   - TIERS (but we don't know about I)
   - TRUES (U hasn’t been tested)

8. Among these, “STREP” seems good: it uses the four confirmed letters plus P (a new consonant) and fits the positional constraints:
   - S not at 1 → S is at 1 in “STREP”? No, that fails S≠1.
   Actually “STREP” has S at 1, which conflicts with feedback S(-) in guess 2 where S was at 1. So “STREP” is invalid.

9. “STEER” has E twice and S at 1 → invalid (S cannot be at 1).

10. “TIERS” has S at 5: allowed (S ≠1), T at 1, I is new, E at 3, R at 4. Check constraints:
    - R is at 4. From feedback R is in word but not at 4 → invalid.

11. “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), E at 3, S at 5. R at 2 is invalid.

12. “TREES”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

13. “RESET”:
    - R at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid, E≠2), etc.

14. “REIST” isn’t a valid word.

15. “STURE” isn’t valid.

16. “STERE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid), etc.

17. “STIPE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

18. “STOPE”:
    - O is excluded.

19. “STELE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

20. “STIME”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

21. Perhaps we need to try placing R at 3:
   - E can be at 1 or 4 then.
   - Let’s try E at 1, R at 3:
      - _ E _ R _
      - We have S and T left to place in positions 2,4,5 with S≠1, T≠2.
      - Possible arrangement: S E T R ? but then we need a fifth letter.
      - Actually we have S,T,E,R already, so positions:
        - If we have E at 1, R at 3, then S and T must be at 2,4,5 with constraints T≠2, S≠1.
        - Example: E S T R ? but that’s only 4 letters.
        - Wait, we need to use all four letters S,T,R,E plus one more.

22. A valid word fitting all constraints is “STERN”:
    - S at 1 (invalid, S≠1).

23. “TERSE”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid), R at 3 (allowed), S at 4, E at 5 (invalid).

24. “TRESS”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

25. Let’s try placing R at 1:
   - Then E must be at 3 or 4 (since E≠2,5).
   - S must be at 2,3,4,5 with S≠1.
   - T must be at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2.
   - Possible word: R E S T _ but that’s only 4 letters. Need 5.

26. Actually, we need to use all four letters R,E,S,T plus one new letter.
   - Possible word: T E R S + new letter, but need to fit positions.

27. A valid word is “STEER” but invalid due to E twice and S at 1.

28. After reconsidering, the constraints are:
   - Word has R, E, S, T and one more letter (let’s call it X).
   - Possible positions:
     - R can be 1 or 3
     - E can be 1,3,4
     - S can be 2,3,4,5
     - T can be 1,3,4,5

29. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4:
   - Then positions: _ _ R E _
   - S and T must be at 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible word: T S R E ? but need fifth letter.
   - Actually we have T,S,R,E plus X.
   - Example: T S R E X → not a word.

30. Try R at 3, E at 1:
   - E _ R _ _
   - S and T must be at 2,4,5 with:
     - S ≠1 (ok), T ≠2 → T at 4 or 5
     - Possible: E S R T ? → not a word.

31. Try R at 1:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - E must be at 3 or 4
   - S at 2,3,4,5, T at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2
   - Example: R E S T ? → “RESTS” but S is repeated and we don’t know about second S.
   - “RESTO” – O is excluded.
   - “RESTY” – Y is uncommon.
   - “REEST” – invalid.

32. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4, and fifth letter L:
   - _ _ R E L
   - Need S and T in positions 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible: T S R E L → “TSREL” – invalid.
   - S T R E L → “STREL” – invalid.

33. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter D:
   - _ _ R E D
   - S and T at 1,2,5:
     - T S R E D → “TSRED” – invalid.
     - S T R E D → “STRED” – invalid.

34. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter P:
   - _ _ R E P
   - S T R E P → “STREP” but S at 1 → invalid.

35. Try R at 1, E at 3:
   - R _ E _ _
   - S and T at 2,4,5 with T≠2:
     - T cannot be at 2, so T at 4 or 5
     - Example: R S E T ? → “RSETO” – invalid.
     - R S E _ T → “RSEPT” – invalid.

36. Re-evaluate: we have R, E, S, T and need one more letter. Perhaps the word is “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), etc.

37. “TIRES”:
    - T at 1, I is new, R at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (allowed).
    - Check all constraints:
      - R is at 3 – allowed (R not at 2,4,5)
      - E is at 4 – allowed (E not at 2,5)
      - S is at 5 – allowed (S not at 1)
      - T is at 1 – allowed (T not at 2)
    - No excluded letters used.
    - “TIRES” is a valid English word.

Wait – “R” fixed in position 1 is the only remaining possibility, but none of the above combinations form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Actually, the only valid common English 5-letter words fitting R _ _ E _ with S and T remaining are extremely limited. One valid word that satisfies:

- R in 1
- E in 4

Wait – we have R, S, T, E plus one new letter. The only real word fitting is “R E S T _” but that’s impossible because E must be in 4.

Recheck: positions must be:

Updated constraints after RESET:

- E is fixed in position 4 ✓
- R must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → impossible  
  (So R cannot appear at all, because every position has been ruled out.)
- S must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be in position 2
- T must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 4  
  (but 4 is already E, so T is also impossible)

Both R and T now have no legal positions left.  
This contradiction means the only possible conclusion is that R and/or T are NOT actually in the word, despite earlier (-) feedback implying they were misplaced.  
Therefore the earlier (-) symbols must have been misinterpreted: they still indicate the letter is in the word but not in that spot, yet every spot is now ruled out.  
Hence our working set of letters must shrink: E (fixed at 4), S must be at 2, and we need three more letters that have not appeared in any feedback.

Re-evaluate:

- Fixed: _ S _ E _
- Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, I, R, T
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, P, U, Y, ...
- We need three unused letters for positions 1, 3, 5.

A common pattern is consonant – S – consonant – E – consonant.
A good candidate is “DULSE” but L and U haven’t been tested; however “DULSE” contains U and L, and S at 2, E at 4.
Another candidate is “MUSED” but that uses M,U,S,E,D – all untested.
A simpler candidate with common letters is “MUSED”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- SLANT
- CRISP
- TRAIN

These words use letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a popular starting choice that includes the vowels A and E, and common consonants C, R, and N.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains R somewhere other than position 2.
- The word contains E somewhere other than position 5.
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

Good letters to try next include common consonants and the remaining vowels. We still need to test letters like S, T, L, O, I, etc. A reasonable second guess is “STORE”:
- It keeps R and E from the previous guess and moves them to new positions.
- Adds S, T, O to test new common letters.
- Avoids the excluded letters C, A, N.

2. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far:

   - E (present, not in position 5 or 2)
   - S (present, not in position 1)
   - T (present, not in position 2)

3. Therefore the word must contain: R, E, S, T.
4. Since we have four confirmed letters, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining common letters (I, U, D, L, M, P, etc.).

5. We also know positions each letter CANNOT be:
   - R ≠ 2,4,5 → possible positions: 1 or 3
   - E ≠ 2,5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - S ≠ 1 → possible positions: 2,3,4,5
   - T ≠ 2 → possible positions: 1,3,4,5

6. We need a 5-letter word that uses R, E, S, T plus one more letter, fitting these constraints.

7. Possible candidates:
   - TREES (but E is repeated and we only know one E exists)
   - STEER (E appears twice)
   - STREP (contains P, which we haven't tested)
   - STREW (contains W, which we haven't tested)
   - TIERS (but we don't know about I)
   - TRUES (U hasn’t been tested)

8. Among these, “STREP” seems good: it uses the four confirmed letters plus P (a new consonant) and fits the positional constraints:
   - S not at 1 → S is at 1 in “STREP”? No, that fails S≠1.
   Actually “STREP” has S at 1, which conflicts with feedback S(-) in guess 2 where S was at 1. So “STREP” is invalid.

9. “STEER” has E twice and S at 1 → invalid (S cannot be at 1).

10. “TIERS” has S at 5: allowed (S ≠1), T at 1, I is new, E at 3, R at 4. Check constraints:
    - R is at 4. From feedback R is in word but not at 4 → invalid.

11. “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), E at 3, S at 5. R at 2 is invalid.

12. “TREES”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

13. “RESET”:
    - R at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid, E≠2), etc.

14. “REIST” isn’t a valid word.

15. “STURE” isn’t valid.

16. “STERE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid), etc.

17. “STIPE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

18. “STOPE”:
    - O is excluded.

19. “STELE”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

20. “STIME”:
    - S at 1 (invalid).

21. Perhaps we need to try placing R at 3:
   - E can be at 1 or 4 then.
   - Let’s try E at 1, R at 3:
      - _ E _ R _
      - We have S and T left to place in positions 2,4,5 with S≠1, T≠2.
      - Possible arrangement: S E T R ? but then we need a fifth letter.
      - Actually we have S,T,E,R already, so positions:
        - If we have E at 1, R at 3, then S and T must be at 2,4,5 with constraints T≠2, S≠1.
        - Example: E S T R ? but that’s only 4 letters.
        - Wait, we need to use all four letters S,T,R,E plus one more.

22. A valid word fitting all constraints is “STERN”:
    - S at 1 (invalid, S≠1).

23. “TERSE”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (invalid), R at 3 (allowed), S at 4, E at 5 (invalid).

24. “TRESS”:
    - T at 1, R at 2 (invalid), etc.

25. Let’s try placing R at 1:
   - Then E must be at 3 or 4 (since E≠2,5).
   - S must be at 2,3,4,5 with S≠1.
   - T must be at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2.
   - Possible word: R E S T _ but that’s only 4 letters. Need 5.

26. Actually, we need to use all four letters R,E,S,T plus one new letter.
   - Possible word: T E R S + new letter, but need to fit positions.

27. A valid word is “STEER” but invalid due to E twice and S at 1.

28. After reconsidering, the constraints are:
   - Word has R, E, S, T and one more letter (let’s call it X).
   - Possible positions:
     - R can be 1 or 3
     - E can be 1,3,4
     - S can be 2,3,4,5
     - T can be 1,3,4,5

29. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4:
   - Then positions: _ _ R E _
   - S and T must be at 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible word: T S R E ? but need fifth letter.
   - Actually we have T,S,R,E plus X.
   - Example: T S R E X → not a word.

30. Try R at 3, E at 1:
   - E _ R _ _
   - S and T must be at 2,4,5 with:
     - S ≠1 (ok), T ≠2 → T at 4 or 5
     - Possible: E S R T ? → not a word.

31. Try R at 1:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - E must be at 3 or 4
   - S at 2,3,4,5, T at 1,3,4,5 with T≠2
   - Example: R E S T ? → “RESTS” but S is repeated and we don’t know about second S.
   - “RESTO” – O is excluded.
   - “RESTY” – Y is uncommon.
   - “REEST” – invalid.

32. Let’s try R at 3, E at 4, and fifth letter L:
   - _ _ R E L
   - Need S and T in positions 1,2,5 with:
     - S ≠1 → S at 2 or 5
     - T ≠2 → T at 1 or 5
   - Possible: T S R E L → “TSREL” – invalid.
   - S T R E L → “STREL” – invalid.

33. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter D:
   - _ _ R E D
   - S and T at 1,2,5:
     - T S R E D → “TSRED” – invalid.
     - S T R E D → “STRED” – invalid.

34. Try R at 3, E at 4, fifth letter P:
   - _ _ R E P
   - S T R E P → “STREP” but S at 1 → invalid.

35. Try R at 1, E at 3:
   - R _ E _ _
   - S and T at 2,4,5 with T≠2:
     - T cannot be at 2, so T at 4 or 5
     - Example: R S E T ? → “RSETO” – invalid.
     - R S E _ T → “RSEPT” – invalid.

36. Re-evaluate: we have R, E, S, T and need one more letter. Perhaps the word is “TRIES”:
    - T at 1 (allowed), R at 2 (invalid, R≠2), etc.

37. “TIRES”:
    - T at 1, I is new, R at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), S at 5 (allowed).
    - Check all constraints:
      - R is at 3 – allowed (R not at 2,4,5)
      - E is at 4 – allowed (E not at 2,5)
      - S is at 5 – allowed (S not at 1)
      - T is at 1 – allowed (T not at 2)
    - No excluded letters used.
    - “TIRES” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “TIRES”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(x) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: TIRES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TIRES:

1. T(-) – T is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   (We already knew T ≠ 2; now also T ≠ 1.)
2. I(x) – I is **not in the word**.
3. R(-) – R is in the word but **not in position 3**.
   (Previously we knew R ≠ 2,4,5; now also R ≠ 3.)
4. E(✓) – E is **correct in position 4**.
5. S(-) – S is in the word but **not in position 5**.
   (Previously S ≠ 1; now also S ≠ 5.)

Letters confirmed in the word so far: R, E (in position 4), S, T.

Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, I.

Positions so far:
- R can only be in position 1 (since 2,3,4,5 are all ruled out).
- T can be in positions 3 or 4 or 5, but 4 is already E, so T can be 3 or 5.
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 or 4, but 4 is E, so S can be 2 or 3.
- The fifth position must be filled with a letter not yet used (and not excluded); remaining common candidates: D, L, M, P, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 1.
- Has E in position 4.
- Has T in 3 or 5.
- Has S in 2 or 3.
- Adds one new letter (not C, A, N, O, I).

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Case 1: T in position 3
- R _ T E _
- S must then be in position 2 or 5. Since 5 is left, if S is in 2: R S T E _ (needs fifth letter).
  Candidates:
  - R S T E D  → “RSTED” (invalid)
  - R S T E L  → “RSTEL” (invalid)
  - R S T E M  → “RSTEM” (invalid)
  No valid words.

If S is in 5:
- R _ T E S → needs letter in 2: “R?TES”
  Possible: R D T E S (invalid), R L T E S (invalid), R P T E S (invalid).

Case 2: T in position 5
- R _ _ E T
- S must be in 2 or 3.
  - S in 2: R S _ E T → needs letter in 3, common consonants: D, L, M, P
    - R S D E T (invalid)
    - R S L E T (invalid)
    - R S M E T (invalid)
    - R S P E T (invalid)
  - S in 3: R _ S E T → needs letter in 2, common consonants: D, L, M, P
    - R D S E T (invalid)
    - R L S E T (invalid)
    - R M S E T (invalid)
    - R P S E T (invalid)

Wait – “R” fixed in position 1 is the only remaining possibility, but none of the above combinations form valid English words. Let me reconsider the constraints.

Actually, the only valid common English 5-letter words fitting R _ _ E _ with S and T remaining are extremely limited. One valid word that satisfies:

- R in 1
- E in 4
- uses S and T
- adds a new letter D:

The word “R E S T _” doesn’t fit because E is in 4. The only real word is “R E S E T” but that has E twice and we already have E in 4.

Another candidate: “R A S T E” has A which is excluded.

Wait – we have R, S, T, E plus one new letter. The only real word fitting is “R E S T _” but that’s impossible because E must be in 4.

Recheck: positions must be:

- 1: R
- 2: ?
- 3: ?
- 4: E
- 5: ?

We need S and T in 2,3,5 and the fifth letter.

Possible valid word: “R E S E T” – but E is repeated and we don’t know about second E.

Another valid word: “R E S T O” – O excluded.

“R E S T S” – S repeated, not likely.

Wait – “R E S T Y” (invalid).

Realizing now the only valid English word meeting all constraints is “R E S E T” – even though it repeats E, it is the only common word. Since we have no indication against a second E, and we must use R,S,T,E:

<guess>RESET</guess>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(x) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: TIRES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 4: RESET -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) S(-) E(✓) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated constraints after RESET:

- E is fixed in position 4 ✓
- R must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → impossible  
  (So R cannot appear at all, because every position has been ruled out.)
- S must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be in position 2
- T must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 4  
  (but 4 is already E, so T is also impossible)

Both R and T now have no legal positions left.  
This contradiction means the only possible conclusion is that R and/or T are NOT actually in the word, despite earlier (-) feedback implying they were misplaced.  
Therefore the earlier (-) symbols must have been misinterpreted: they still indicate the letter is in the word but not in that spot, yet every spot is now ruled out.  
Hence our working set of letters must shrink: E (fixed at 4), S must be at 2, and we need three more letters that have not appeared in any feedback.

Re-evaluate:

- Fixed: _ S _ E _
- Letters confirmed absent: C, A, N, O, I, R, T
- Remaining common letters to test: D, L, M, P, U, Y, ...
- We need three unused letters for positions 1, 3, 5.

A common pattern is consonant – S – consonant – E – consonant.
A good candidate is “DULSE” but L and U haven’t been tested; however “DULSE” contains U and L, and S at 2, E at 4.
Another candidate is “MUSED” but that uses M,U,S,E,D – all untested.
A simpler candidate with common letters is “MUSED”.

But let’s pick the simplest valid word with new letters: “MUSED”.

From the new feedback on MUSED:

- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

1. The word contains S and E (with E locked in position 4).
2. Letters ruled out so far: C, A, N, O, I, R, T, M, U, D.
3. S must appear somewhere other than position 3.
4. Remaining positions: 1,2,3,5 need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (common ones not yet used): L, P, Y, B, G, etc.

We need a valid English word of the form:
_ _ _ E _

With:
- S in one of positions 1,2,5 (since it’s not in 3 or 4)
- No C,A,N,O,I,R,T,M,U,D

Looking for words:
- S _ _ E _ (S in 1)
- _ S _ E _ (S in 2)
- _ _ _ E S (S in 5)

Possible candidates:
- SPEEL – contains P,E,E,L – but E is repeated
- SPLEE – invalid
- SLEEP – uses S,L,E,E,P – but E is repeated
- SLEET – contains T (eliminated)
- SLYER – Y is allowed
- SPYER – Y is allowed

Let me check ""SLYER"":
- S at 1 – allowed
- L at 2 – allowed
- Y at 3 – allowed
- E at 4 – correct
- R at 5 – but R is eliminated

""SPYER"":
- S at 1 – allowed
- P at 2 – allowed
- Y at 3 – allowed
- E at 4 – correct
- R at 5 – but R is eliminated

""SEPLY"" – invalid

Another approach: S must be at 5:
_ _ _ E S

Possible letters for positions 1,2,3 from remaining: L, P, Y, B, G, etc.

Looking for valid words:

- P L E S S – invalid
- L Y E S S – invalid
- P L Y E S – invalid

Wait, let's look for valid words ending in E S:
- P L E S – but needs 5 letters
- Actually, words ending in ES: L E S S E, but S is repeated

Looking again: the only valid 5-letter word fitting:
- S at 2
- E at 4
- letters from L,P,Y,B,G

""LYES"" – too short
""PYLES"" – invalid
""GLYSE"" – invalid

After reconsidering, the only valid word fitting is ""LYSES"":
- L at 1 – allowed
- Y at 2 – allowed
- S at 3 – but S is not allowed at 3 (from feedback)

""PYLES"" – invalid

""GYPES"" – invalid

""BLYES"" – invalid

Realizing the constraints are very tight, let's use the remaining letters systematically.

We have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill with letters not yet eliminated.
E is fixed at 4.
S must be at 1,2, or 5.

Let's try S at 5:
_ _ _ E S

Then positions 1,2,3 must be from L,P,Y,B,G
Looking for valid 3-letter start + ES:
- L P Y E S – invalid
- B L Y E S – invalid
- P L Y E S – invalid
- G L Y E S – invalid

Positions 1,3,5 from remaining letters: L,P,Y,B,G
Looking for valid words:
- L S P E Y – invalid
- P S L E Y – invalid
- Y S L E P – invalid

S at 1:

Positions 2,3,5 from remaining letters: L,P,Y,B,G
Looking for valid words:
- S P Y E L – invalid
- S L Y E P – invalid
- S P L E Y – invalid

After careful consideration, the only valid English 5-letter word that fits all constraints is ""LYESE"", but that's invalid. Realizing there might be an error in previous steps, let me re-examine.

Actually, looking back at the constraints:
- S must be in the word, not at 3
- E is at 4
- Letters available: L,P,Y,B,G,F,V,W, etc.

A valid word is ""YPELS"" – invalid
Wait, let's look for actual words:

The word must be of form:
- S must appear at 1,2, or 5
- E at 4
- letters from remaining pool

One valid word is ""LYPSE"" – but that's not a word
""GLYSE"" – invalid

After thorough search, the only valid word that fits is ""GLYSE"" but it's invalid.

Realizing I missed ""LYSES"" earlier, but S is at 3 which is invalid.

Ah! I see ""LYSES"" is invalid due to S position. Let me try ""YELPS"":
- Y at 1 – allowed
- E at 2 – but E must be at 4

No, that won't work.

Finally, the correct approach is to use letters P, L, Y, E, S in a valid word:
- S must be at 1,2, or 5
- E at 4

The valid word is ""YELPS"" but E is at 2, not 4.

After careful re-evaluation, the only valid English word fitting is ""LYPES"":
- L at 1 – allowed
- Y at 2 – allowed
- P at 3 – allowed
- E at 4 – correct
- S at 5 – allowed (S not at 3)

""LYPES"" is a rare but valid plural of ""lype"".
