Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: Very common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Second most common vowel

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback for CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N was in position 4, so N is not in position 4 but it is somewhere else in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains N somewhere (but not in position 4).
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

- SOUND: contains N (in position 5, which is fine), and common letters S, O, U, D.
- MOUND: similar, but M is less common than S.
- SOUND seems better.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, U, D  
- Letters known to be present (but not yet in the correct spot):
  – N (→ not positions 4 or 5)
  – O (→ not position 2)
- One letter is certain so far: S in position 1 (✓ at position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains N somewhere (positions 2 or 3, since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
4. Uses fresh common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining letters to test: L, I, Y, T, K, H, M, N, O (already know O is somewhere), etc.

Candidate words:
- SN…   (N must be later than position 2, so positions 3 or 4, but 4 is disallowed, so N needs to be at 3)
  – SNIPY (but Y may be less useful)
  – SNICK (contains C which is already ruled out)
  – SNIFT (but F isn’t very common)
  – SNAIL (contains A – ruled out)
  – SNIKT (not a real word)
  – SNIPE (contains E – ruled out)
  – SNY (three letters only)
  – SN… starts feel too constrained.

Another approach: use O in a different spot and N in allowed positions.

How about:
- SLINK: starts with S, has L, I, N(3), K – all fresh letters and N in allowed spot 3. O is not used here, but we have no info that O must be used (only that it’s in word but not at 2). We can test O later.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:

- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Second most common vowel

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N was in position 4, so N is not in position 4 but it is somewhere else in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains N somewhere (but not in position 4).
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

We want a new word that:
1. Contains N (not in position 4).
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Let's pick a word with common consonants and vowels not yet used. Good candidates could be:
- SOUND: contains N (in position 5, which is fine), and common letters S, O, U, D.
- MOUND: similar, but M is less common than S.
- SOUND seems better.

Let's go with SOUND.

  – N (→ not positions 4 or 5)
  – O (→ not position 2)
- One letter is certain so far: S in position 1 (✓ at position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains N somewhere (positions 2 or 3, since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
4. Uses fresh common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining letters to test: L, I, Y, T, K, H, M, N, O (already know O is somewhere), etc.

Candidate words:
- SN…   (N must be later than position 2, so positions 3 or 4, but 4 is disallowed, so N needs to be at 3)
  – SNIPY (but Y may be less useful)
  – SNICK (contains C which is already ruled out)
  – SNIFT (but F isn’t very common)
  – SNAIL (contains A – ruled out)
  – SNIKT (not a real word)
  – SNIPE (contains E – ruled out)
  – SNY (three letters only)
  – SN… starts feel too constrained.

Another approach: use O in a different spot and N in allowed positions.

How about:
- SLINK: starts with S, has L, I, N(3), K – all fresh letters and N in allowed spot 3. O is not used here, but we have no info that O must be used (only that it’s in word but not at 2). We can test O later.

From the feedback so far:

1. Position 1: S (✓) – confirmed correct.
2. Position 2: N (✓) – confirmed correct.
3. Position 3: O (✓) – confirmed correct.
4. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, U, D, L, I, K, W, Y.

So the word has the form: S N O _ _

Remaining letters (not yet excluded): B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two distinct letters from the remaining set that form a valid English word starting with SNO.

Common English words starting with SNO and 5 letters:
- SNORE, SNORT, SNOOP, SNOOK, SNOBS, SNOGS, SNOTS, SNOBS, etc.

But we already ruled out R, E, K, P, B, S, etc. Let's check which of these are still possible:

- SNORE: R and E are already ruled out.
- SNORT: R and T. R is ruled out.
- SNOOP: P and O. P is allowed, but O is already used in position 3, and no letter repeats are indicated yet. However, double O is possible, but since O is already in position 3, it's unlikely (no feedback indicated duplicates). Also P is allowed but O is already used correctly in position 3, so this might not fit.
- SNOOK: K is ruled out.
- SNOBS: B and S. S is already used in position 1, and no duplicates indicated.
- SNOGS: G and S. S is already used.
- SNOTS: T and S. S is already used.
- SNOW... already tried and failed.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Possible combinations for positions 4 and 5:
- SNOM? SNOM is not a word.
- SNOT: T is allowed, but SNOT is a word. However, SNOT would have T in position 5, but we need to check if T is allowed (it is).
- SNOG: G is allowed.
- SNOB: B is allowed.
- SNOG: G is allowed.

But we need a 5-letter word starting with SNO, so the only plausible ones are:
- SNOB... but SNOB is 4 letters.
- SNOT: 4 letters.
Wait, actually looking at valid 5-letter words starting with SNO:
- SNORE (ruled out by R and E)
- SNORT (ruled out by R)
- SNOOT (O is already in position 3, and T is allowed)
- SNOOK (K is ruled out)
- SNOBS (B is allowed, but S is already used)
- SNOGS (G and S – S is used)
- SNOBS (B and S – S is used)
- SNOOP (O is already in position 3, P is allowed, but double O is possible)
- SNOT... only 4 letters.

Looking at allowed letters and valid words, the only plausible 5-letter word starting with SNO and using allowed letters is SNOOT (S N O O T), but this uses O twice, and we have no information about duplicates. However, since O is already in position 3, and no feedback indicated duplicates, this might be risky.

Another option is to check if there are any other valid words. After checking, the only valid 5-letter word that fits S N O _ _ with remaining letters is SNOOT (using T and O again). But since O is already used, and no duplicates indicated, this might not be correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with SNO and ending with two of these letters:
- SNOBT (not a word)
- SNOFT (not a word)
- SNOGT (not a word)
- SNOMT (not a word)
- SNOPT (not a word)
- SNOTT (not a word)
- SNOVT (not a word)
- SNOXT (not a word)
- SNOZT (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. 

Looking back, the only valid 5-letter word starting with SNO that uses allowed letters is SNOOT (S N O O T), even though it repeats O. This might be the intended word, or perhaps I missed another.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern S N O _ _ with the remaining allowed letters (excluding ruled out ones) is SNOOT.

Thus, the next guess is SNOOT.

<guess>SNOOT</guess>",SNOOT,"From the feedback so far:

1. Position 1: S (✓) – confirmed correct.
2. Position 2: N (✓) – confirmed correct.
3. Position 3: O (✓) – confirmed correct.
4. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, U, D, L, I, K, W, Y.

Also P is allowed but O is already used correctly in position 3, so this might not fit.
- SNOOK: K is ruled out.
- SNOBS: B and S. S is already used in position 1, and no duplicates indicated.
- SNOGS: G and S. S is already used.
- SNOTS: T and S. S is already used.
- SNOW... already tried and failed.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Possible combinations for positions 4 and 5:
- SNOM? SNOM is not a word.
- SNOT: T is allowed, but SNOT is a word. However, SNOT would have T in position 5, but we need to check if T is allowed (it is).
- SNOG: G is allowed.
- SNOB: B is allowed.
- SNOG: G is allowed.

But we need a 5-letter word starting with SNO, so the only plausible ones are:
- SNOB... but SNOB is 4 letters.
- SNOT: 4 letters.
Wait, actually looking at valid 5-letter words starting with SNO:
- SNORE (ruled out by R and E)
- SNORT (ruled out by R)
- SNOOT (O is already in position 3, and T is allowed)
- SNOOK (K is ruled out)
- SNOBS (B is allowed, but S is already used)
- SNOGS (G and S – S is used)
- SNOBS (B and S – S is used)
- SNOOP (O is already in position 3, P is allowed, but double O is possible)
- SNOT... only 4 letters.

Looking at allowed letters and valid words, the only plausible 5-letter word starting with SNO and using allowed letters is SNOOT (S N O O T), but this uses O twice, and we have no information about duplicates. However, since O is already in position 3, and no feedback indicated duplicates, this might be risky.

Another option is to check if there are any other valid words. After checking, the only valid 5-letter word that fits S N O _ _ with remaining letters is SNOOT (using T and O again). But since O is already used, and no duplicates indicated, this might not be correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with SNO and ending with two of these letters:
- SNOBT (not a word)
- SNOFT (not a word)
- SNOGT (not a word)
- SNOMT (not a word)
- SNOPT (not a word)
- SNOTT (not a word)
- SNOVT (not a word)
- SNOXT (not a word)
- SNOZT (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. 

Looking back, the only valid 5-letter word starting with SNO that uses allowed letters is SNOOT (S N O O T), even though it repeats O. This might be the intended word, or perhaps I missed another.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern S N O _ _ with the remaining allowed letters (excluding ruled out ones) is SNOOT.

Thus, the next guess is SNOOT.",Guess 5: SNOOT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(✓) T(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SNOOP,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: Very common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Second most common vowel

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N was in position 4, so N is not in position 4 but it is somewhere else in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains N somewhere (but not in position 4).
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

We want a new word that:
1. Contains N (not in position 4).
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Let's pick a word with common consonants and vowels not yet used. Good candidates could be:
- SOUND: contains N (in position 5, which is fine), and common letters S, O, U, D.
- MOUND: similar, but M is less common than S.
- SOUND seems better.

Let's go with SOUND.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, E, U, D  
- Letters known to be present (but not yet in the correct spot):
  – N (→ not positions 4 or 5)
  – O (→ not position 2)
- One letter is certain so far: S in position 1 (✓ at position 1).

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains N somewhere (positions 2 or 3, since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
4. Uses fresh common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining letters to test: L, I, Y, T, K, H, M, N, O (already know O is somewhere), etc.

Candidate words:
- SN…   (N must be later than position 2, so positions 3 or 4, but 4 is disallowed, so N needs to be at 3)
  – SNIPY (but Y may be less useful)
  – SNICK (contains C which is already ruled out)
  – SNIFT (but F isn’t very common)
  – SNAIL (contains A – ruled out)
  – SNIKT (not a real word)
  – SNIPE (contains E – ruled out)
  – SNY (three letters only)
  – SN… starts feel too constrained.

Another approach: use O in a different spot and N in allowed positions.

How about:
- SLINK: starts with S, has L, I, N(3), K – all fresh letters and N in allowed spot 3. O is not used here, but we have no info that O must be used (only that it’s in word but not at 2). We can test O later.

This seems solid.

Let’s choose SLINK.

<guess>SLINK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: SLINK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) I(x) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current certainties and constraints:
1. S is fixed in the 1st position (✓ in all guesses).
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from SLINK and SOUND feedback). Therefore N can only be in position 2.
3. The following letters are definitely absent: C, R, A, E, U, D, L, I, K.
4. We already know O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from SOUND). Since S is in position 1 and N must be in position 2, the remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must be filled from the still-allowed letters and must include O.

Still-allowed letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not explicitly excluded).

Because O must appear somewhere in positions 3-5, and we want common English letters to maximize information, we should try O in each possible remaining slot (3, 4, 5).

Let’s tentatively place O in position 3 and pick common remaining consonants for 4 and 5. A good candidate is S N O W Y, but Y is less common. SNORT uses R (already gone). SNOTY not a word. SNOMG not a word. How about SNOUT? Uses U which is already eliminated. 

Next, try O in position 4: S N _ O _. Common letters left: B, F, G, H, M, P, T, Y. SNBOW? No. SNGOT? No. SNFOT? No. SNBOP? No. SNHOT? Not a word. SNMOT? No. SNHOG? No. SNPOG? No. 

Try O in position 5: S N _ _ O. Common letters: B, F, G, H, M, P, T, Y. SNPYO? No. SNBTO? No. SNBMO? No. SNHGO? No. SNHBO? No. SNBHO? No. SNTHO? No. SNYTO? No. SNBFO? No. 

Wait, let’s list actual words:
- SN _ _ O: “SNOWY” has W and Y (both allowed). That’s a valid word.
- SN _ O _: “SNOWY” doesn’t fit, but “SNOWY” is S N O W Y. That would put O in position 3, which we considered.

Let’s pick a word that fits S N _ _ O: “SNOWY” is S N O W Y, but that’s S N O W Y – positions: 1=S, 2=N, 3=O, 4=W, 5=Y. This fits all constraints and uses common letters. This also places O in position 3, which is allowed (only position 2 was disallowed for O).

So the next guess is SNOWY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. Position 1: S (✓) – confirmed correct.
2. Position 2: N (✓) – confirmed correct.
3. Position 3: O (✓) – confirmed correct.
4. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, U, D, L, I, K, W, Y.

So the word has the form: S N O _ _

Remaining letters (not yet excluded): B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two distinct letters from the remaining set that form a valid English word starting with SNO.

Common English words starting with SNO and 5 letters:
- SNORE, SNORT, SNOOP, SNOOK, SNOBS, SNOGS, SNOTS, SNOBS, etc.

But we already ruled out R, E, K, P, B, S, etc. Let's check which of these are still possible:

- SNORE: R and E are already ruled out.
- SNORT: R and T. R is ruled out.
- SNOOP: P and O. P is allowed, but O is already used in position 3, and no letter repeats are indicated yet. However, double O is possible, but since O is already in position 3, it's unlikely (no feedback indicated duplicates). Also P is allowed but O is already used correctly in position 3, so this might not fit.
- SNOOK: K is ruled out.

But since O is already used, and no duplicates indicated, this might not be correct.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Z.\n\nLooking for 5-letter words starting with SNO and ending with two of these letters:\n- SNOBT (not a word)\n- SNOFT (not a word)\n- SNOGT (not a word)\n- SNOMT (not a word)\n- SNOPT (not a word)\n- SNOTT (not a word)\n- SNOVT (not a word)\n- SNOXT (not a word)\n- SNOZT (not a word)\n\nHmm, none of these are valid. \n\nLooking back, the only valid 5-letter word starting with SNO that uses allowed letters is SNOOT (S N O O T), even though it repeats O. This might be the intended word, or perhaps I missed another.\n\nAfter careful reconsideration, the only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern S N O _ _ with the remaining allowed letters (excluding ruled out ones) is SNOOT.\n\nThus, the next guess is SNOOT.\n\n<guess>SNOOT</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: SLINK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) I(x) N(-) K(x)\nGuess 4: SNOWY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 5: SNOOT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>

S N O O T
✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ x  

So we now know:
- S N O O are all locked in positions 1-4.
- Position 5 is wrong (T is not in the word).

Therefore the secret word must be S N O O _ , where the blank is a letter we have not yet excluded.

Letters already ruled-out (explicit ‘x’ or implied by missing from any correct slot):
C, R, A, E, D, L, I, K, W, Y, T.

Still-allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form SNOO? using only those letters at the end.

Valid dictionary words:
SNOOB – but B is still allowed, yet SNOOB is informal and rarely accepted in word lists.
SNOOF – not standard.
SNOOG – not a word.
SNOOK – K is ruled out.
SNOOL – L is ruled out.
SNOOM – not a word.
SNOOP – P is allowed.
SNOOR – R is ruled out.
SNOOT – T is ruled out (already guessed).
SNOOV – not a word.
SNOOW – W is ruled out.
SNOOZ – not standard; SNOOZE is 6 letters.

The only common 5-letter word remaining is SNOOP.

Hence position 5 must be P.
