- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best first guesses are typically those that contain common letters and can help eliminate or confirm a large number of possibilities. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good first guess should:
1. Contain common letters
2. Not repeat letters (to test more unique letters)
3. Have a good vowel-consonant balance

Some excellent first guesses include:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E - 5 of the most common letters)
- STARE (similar to ARISE but different order)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ARISE as it contains 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- A(✓) – A is the first letter of the secret word.  
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. It contains R and I somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain S or E.

Possible letter positions:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: Not R, not E, not S. Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but keep it a common word)
- Position 3: Not I. Possible: A, E, O, U, etc. (but E is excluded), or common consonants.
- Position 4 & 5: Open, but must include R and I somewhere.

Good strategy: choose a word that starts with A, places R in a new spot (e.g., 3, 4, or 5), and places I in a new spot (e.g., 2, 4, or 5), while avoiding S and E.

Candidate words:
- ACRID – A(✓) C, R in 3, I in 4, D. Checks: R moved to 3, I to 4, no S/E.
- AROID – A(✓) R in 2 (but R can’t be in 2), invalid.
- ABRID – Not valid.
- APRIC – Not valid.

ACRID seems valid and fits all constraints.
