For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Classic starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good balance would be a word like ""SLATE"" - it has:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common ending letter
- E: most common letter in English

This gives broad coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in positions where they commonly appear.

3. We still have no letters pinned to their correct positions.

The remaining alphabet pool (excluding the above) is:
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- Fill remaining spots with common consonants from the remaining pool
- Try to get new letters tested

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (x-marked at least once):
S, A, T, O, D, N, F, R

Remaining frequent consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I (already marked “-” in position 3), U, Y

The only positions L can still occupy are 1 or 5.
The only positions E can still occupy are 1 or 3 (but 1 would conflict with L), so E must be in 3.

So tentative structure:
- Position 3 = E
- L must be either 1 or 5

Let’s test a word that puts L in position 1 and E in position 3, while introducing common new letters in 2, 4, 5.

Candidate: “LEMON”
- L in 1, E in 3, M, O, N – but O and N are already ruled out.

Candidate: “LEMUR”
- L in 1, E in 3, M, U, R – R is ruled out.

Candidate: “LEKU_” – need another common consonant.

Candidate: “LEMK_” – not a word.

Candidate: “LECHY” – C, H, Y are all still possible.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Classic starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good balance would be a word like ""SLATE"" - it has:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common ending letter
- E: most common letter in English

This gives broad coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in positions where they commonly appear.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, E
- L cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want to test a word that:
- Contains both L and E in new positions
- Uses other common letters to maximize information
- Avoids S, A, T

A good choice would be ""OLDEN"":
- It includes L (now in position 2, which we know is wrong, so this will test if L appears elsewhere)
- It includes E (now in position 4 instead of 5)
- It introduces common letters O, N, D
- Avoids the eliminated letters S, A, T

1. Letters we know are in the word (but may be in wrong positions):
   - L: must appear, cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - E: must appear, cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word (from first two guesses):
   S, A, T, O, D, N

3. We still have no letters pinned to their correct positions.

The remaining alphabet pool (excluding the above) is:
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good strategy now:
- Place L and E in new positions to test their correct locations
- Fill remaining spots with common consonants from the remaining pool
- Try to get new letters tested

Let's try a word that uses L and E in new positions and introduces common consonants:
- L cannot be in 2 or 3, so possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- E cannot be in 4 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3

Good candidates from remaining letters: R, I, M, B, C, F, H, K

Trying ""FLIER"":
- F, I, R are new letters to test
- L is in position 3 (new position, though we know it's wrong here)
- E is in position 2 (new position)

From the new feedback on LECHY:
- L is still only “-” (in word, wrong place); now we know it cannot be in position 1 either.
- E is now fixed in position 3 (✓).
- C and Y are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 4.

Current certainties:
- Position 3 = E
- Letters we still need to place: L, H
- Letters left to test (common ones still allowed): B, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, I (but I was “-” once), etc.
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.
- H cannot be in position 4 → could be 1, 2, or 5, but 5 is taken by L, so 1 or 2.

So the word structure is:
_ _ E _ L with H in either 1 or 2.

Possible patterns:
H _ E _ L  or  _ H E _ L

Let’s test H _ E _ L using common remaining consonants for the blank (position 4).
Common letters left: B, G, K, M, P, U, etc.

Candidate: H E E _ L – duplicate E, invalid.
Candidate: H E K _ L – need a 4th letter.
Candidate: H E B L – but word length.

Wait, pattern is 5 letters: positions 1 2 3 4 5 with 3=E and 5=L.
So structure is: [1] [2] E [4] L

H must be in 1 or 2.

Option 1: H in 1 → H _ E _ L
   – try H U E K L – not a word
   – H E E _ L – invalid
   – H I E K L – possible
   – H I E C L – C already out
   – H I E B L – “HIE” is word but not sure
   – H I E G L – “HIEG” not word
   – H U E G L – not a word

Option 2: H in 2 → _ H E _ L
   – M H E _ L – not common
   – B H E _ L – nope
   – P H E _ L – try P H E K L – no
   – U H E _ L – no
   – G H E _ L – no
   – W H E _ L – no
   – K H E _ L – no
   – V H E _ L – no
   – B H E E L – duplicate
   – W H E E L – duplicate

Let me rethink common 5-letter words with E in 3 and L in 5, H somewhere.

Word list brainstorm:
- WHEEL – but double E, and W/H/E/E/L – but we know H must be in word, L in 5, E in 3. So W H E _ L → WHEEL fits except double E. But E is fixed only at 3, so okay.
But we have to test new letters in 4.

Actually, we need to test a new letter in 4. We haven’t used B, G, K, M, P, U, V, W yet.

Let me try a word that fits H _ E _ L and uses one of these.

Candidate: H U E K L – not valid
Candidate: H U E G L – not valid
Candidate: H U E M L – not valid

Wait, perhaps H in 2 is better.

Candidate: M H E L L – but double L is allowed, but L is fixed at 5, so M H E _ L. 

Let me try a real word: “UPHEL” – no.

Real words fitting _ H E _ L:
- CHEEL – not common
- SHELF – S is out
- SHELL – S out
- THEWL – archaic
- PHEAL – no

Real word: “WHELP” – but ends with P, not L.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E, not L.

Real word: “CHIEL” – C is out.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but P, H, I, A, L – A is out, I was “-”.

Hmm, let me try “KNELL” – K, N, E, L, L – N is out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out, ends with N.

Real word: “REBEL” – R is out.

Real word: “LEVEL” – V, L, E, V, L – L at 5, E at 3, V is new, but double L and double V.

Let me try “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – E is at 3, L at 5, B and V are new. Fits.

But we need H in word.

Real word: “HEBEL” – not common.

Real word: “HEXAL” – X is rare.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words with E in 3, L in 5, and H somewhere.

Real words:
- AHEML – no
- C H E E L – C out
- W H E E L – W, H, E, E, L – this uses H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W and E new. E is already placed, W is new.

But we have to test new letters in 4. In WHEEL, position 4 is E, which is already in word. Maybe not optimal.

Alternative: “THESE” – but ends with E, not L.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “DEBEL” – D out.

Real word: “PEBEL” – no.

Real word: “KEVEL” – K, E, V, E, L – K and V new. E at 3, L at 5.

Let me try “KEVEL” – but seems rare.

Real word: “MEVEL” – no.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – this is valid.

But we have H must be in word.

Real word: “HAVEL” – A is out.

Real word: “HIVEL” – not word.

Real word: “HOVEL” – O is out.

Real word: “HEVEL” – no.

Real word: “HEVEL” – not valid.

Real word: “HELVE” – ends with E.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Real word: “HELLO” – ends with O.

Real word: “HENGE” – ends with E.

Seems stuck. Let me think of words ending with EL where H is second letter.

Real word: “CHEEL” – C out.

Real word: “SHELF” – ends with F.

Real word: “SHELL” – ends with L, but S is out.

Real word: “THELF” – not word.

Real word: “THEIR” – ends with R.

Real word: “THEIR” – not ending with L.

Real word: “THIEL” – not common.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but A is out.

Real word: “CHILL” – ends with L, C out.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W new.

Let’s try WHEEL:
Positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=L

This gives us:
- H in 2 (possible)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W and new E in 4 (E already known, but tests W)
- L in 5 (correct? we don’t know yet if L is at 5, but we have to test)

Actually, we know L must be in 5 because it can’t be 1-4. So word ends with EL, E is at 3, so word is ? ? E ? L.

But we have H must be in 1 or 2.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – but no H.

Real word: “LEVEL” – L, E, V, E, L – L at 5, E at 3, V new – but no H.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “KNELL” – N out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out.

Real word: “HELVE” – H, E, L, V, E – ends with E.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words ending with EL where E is at 3:

Actually, word structure is [1][2]E[4]L and must include H.

Possible words:
- “THE EL” – not 5 letters.
- “SHELF” – ends with F.
- “SHELL” – ends with L, S out.
- “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “BEVEL” – no H.

Real word: “WHEAL” – A out.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, W in 1, E in 4.

Only valid common word seems “WHEEL” despite double E.

Let me choose “WHEEL” to test:
- W (new)
- H (new, in 2)
- E (correct at 3)
- E (already known)
- L (must be at 5)

This will confirm if H is at 2 and L at 5.

<guess>WHEEL</guess>
</think>

<guess>WHEEL</guess>",WHEEL,"From the new feedback on LECHY:
- L is still only “-” (in word, wrong place); now we know it cannot be in position 1 either.
- E is now fixed in position 3 (✓).
- C and Y are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 4.

Current certainties:

Candidate: H E E _ L – duplicate E, invalid.
Candidate: H E K _ L – need a 4th letter.
Candidate: H E B L – but word length.

Wait, pattern is 5 letters: positions 1 2 3 4 5 with 3=E and 5=L.
So structure is: [1] [2] E [4] L

H must be in 1 or 2.

- WHEEL – but double E, and W/H/E/E/L – but we know H must be in word, L in 5, E in 3. So W H E _ L → WHEEL fits except double E. But E is fixed only at 3, so okay.
But we have to test new letters in 4.

Actually, we need to test a new letter in 4. We haven’t used B, G, K, M, P, U, V, W yet.

Let me try a word that fits H _ E _ L and uses one of these.

Candidate: H U E K L – not valid
Candidate: H U E G L – not valid
Candidate: H U E M L – not valid

Wait, perhaps H in 2 is better.

Candidate: M H E L L – but double L is allowed, but L is fixed at 5, so M H E _ L. 

Let me try a real word: “UPHEL” – no.

Real words fitting _ H E _ L:
- CHEEL – not common
- SHELF – S is out
- SHELL – S out
- THEWL – archaic
- PHEAL – no

Real word: “WHELP” – but ends with P, not L.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E, not L.

Real word: “CHIEL” – C is out.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but P, H, I, A, L – A is out, I was “-”.

Hmm, let me try “KNELL” – K, N, E, L, L – N is out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out, ends with N.

Real word: “REBEL” – R is out.

Real word: “LEVEL” – V, L, E, V, L – L at 5, E at 3, V is new, but double L and double V.

Let me try “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – E is at 3, L at 5, B and V are new. Fits.

But we need H in word.

Real word: “HEBEL” – not common.

Real word: “HEXAL” – X is rare.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words with E in 3, L in 5, and H somewhere.

Real words:
- AHEML – no
- C H E E L – C out
- W H E E L – W, H, E, E, L – this uses H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W and E new. E is already placed, W is new.

But we have to test new letters in 4. In WHEEL, position 4 is E, which is already in word. Maybe not optimal.

Alternative: “THESE” – but ends with E, not L.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “DEBEL” – D out.

Real word: “PEBEL” – no.

Real word: “KEVEL” – K, E, V, E, L – K and V new. E at 3, L at 5.

Let me try “KEVEL” – but seems rare.

Real word: “MEVEL” – no.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – this is valid.

But we have H must be in word.

Real word: “HAVEL” – A is out.

Real word: “HIVEL” – not word.

Real word: “HOVEL” – O is out.

Real word: “HEVEL” – no.

Real word: “HEVEL” – not valid.

Real word: “HELVE” – ends with E.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Real word: “HELLO” – ends with O.

Real word: “HENGE” – ends with E.

Seems stuck. Let me think of words ending with EL where H is second letter.

Real word: “CHEEL” – C out.

Real word: “SHELF” – ends with F.

Real word: “SHELL” – ends with L, but S is out.

Real word: “THELF” – not word.

Real word: “THEIR” – ends with R.

Real word: “THEIR” – not ending with L.

Real word: “THIEL” – not common.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but A is out.

Real word: “CHILL” – ends with L, C out.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W new.

Let’s try WHEEL:
Positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=L

This gives us:
- H in 2 (possible)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W and new E in 4 (E already known, but tests W)
- L in 5 (correct? we don’t know yet if L is at 5, but we have to test)

Actually, we know L must be in 5 because it can’t be 1-4. So word ends with EL, E is at 3, so word is ? ? E ? L.

But we have H must be in 1 or 2.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – but no H.

Real word: “LEVEL” – L, E, V, E, L – L at 5, E at 3, V new – but no H.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “KNELL” – N out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out.

Real word: “HELVE” – H, E, L, V, E – ends with E.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words ending with EL where E is at 3:

Actually, word structure is [1][2]E[4]L and must include H.

Possible words:
- “THE EL” – not 5 letters.
- “SHELF” – ends with F.
- “SHELL” – ends with L, S out.
- “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “BEVEL” – no H.

Real word: “WHEAL” – A out.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, W in 1, E in 4.

Only valid common word seems “WHEEL” despite double E.

Let me choose “WHEEL” to test:
- W (new)
- H (new, in 2)
- E (correct at 3)
- E (already known)
- L (must be at 5)

This will confirm if H is at 2 and L at 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Classic starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good balance would be a word like ""SLATE"" - it has:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common ending letter
- E: most common letter in English

This gives broad coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in positions where they commonly appear.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, E
- L cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

Next, I want to test a word that:
- Contains both L and E in new positions
- Uses other common letters to maximize information
- Avoids S, A, T

A good choice would be ""OLDEN"":
- It includes L (now in position 2, which we know is wrong, so this will test if L appears elsewhere)
- It includes E (now in position 4 instead of 5)
- It introduces common letters O, N, D
- Avoids the eliminated letters S, A, T

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints from both guesses:

1. Letters we know are in the word (but may be in wrong positions):
   - L: must appear, cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - E: must appear, cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word (from first two guesses):
   S, A, T, O, D, N

3. We still have no letters pinned to their correct positions.

The remaining alphabet pool (excluding the above) is:
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good strategy now:
- Place L and E in new positions to test their correct locations
- Fill remaining spots with common consonants from the remaining pool
- Try to get new letters tested

Let's try a word that uses L and E in new positions and introduces common consonants:
- L cannot be in 2 or 3, so possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- E cannot be in 4 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, 3

Good candidates from remaining letters: R, I, M, B, C, F, H, K

Trying ""FLIER"":
- F, I, R are new letters to test
- L is in position 3 (new position, though we know it's wrong here)
- E is in position 2 (new position)

<guess>FLIER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FLIER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(-) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (but not yet positioned):
- L – cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it’s appeared in 2 & 3 & 4 and always marked “-”)
- E – cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it’s appeared in 5, 4, 2 and always marked “-”)

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (x-marked at least once):
S, A, T, O, D, N, F, R

Remaining frequent consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I (already marked “-” in position 3), U, Y

The only positions L can still occupy are 1 or 5.
The only positions E can still occupy are 1 or 3 (but 1 would conflict with L), so E must be in 3.

So tentative structure:
- Position 3 = E
- L must be either 1 or 5

Let’s test a word that puts L in position 1 and E in position 3, while introducing common new letters in 2, 4, 5.

Candidate: “LEMON”
- L in 1, E in 3, M, O, N – but O and N are already ruled out.

Candidate: “LEMUR”
- L in 1, E in 3, M, U, R – R is ruled out.

Candidate: “LEKU_” – need another common consonant.

Candidate: “LEMK_” – not a word.

Candidate: “LECHY” – C, H, Y are all still possible.

Let’s go with “LECHY”:
- L in 1 (possible)
- E in 3 (possible)
- C, H, Y are all fresh letters that we haven’t tested.

<guess>LECHY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FLIER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(-) E(-) R(x)
Guess 4: LECHY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) C(x) H(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on LECHY:
- L is still only “-” (in word, wrong place); now we know it cannot be in position 1 either.
- E is now fixed in position 3 (✓).
- C and Y are not in the word.
- H is in the word but not in position 4.

Current certainties:
- Position 3 = E
- Letters we still need to place: L, H
- Letters left to test (common ones still allowed): B, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, I (but I was “-” once), etc.
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 5.
- H cannot be in position 4 → could be 1, 2, or 5, but 5 is taken by L, so 1 or 2.

So the word structure is:
_ _ E _ L with H in either 1 or 2.

Possible patterns:
H _ E _ L  or  _ H E _ L

Let’s test H _ E _ L using common remaining consonants for the blank (position 4).
Common letters left: B, G, K, M, P, U, etc.

Candidate: H E E _ L – duplicate E, invalid.
Candidate: H E K _ L – need a 4th letter.
Candidate: H E B L – but word length.

Wait, pattern is 5 letters: positions 1 2 3 4 5 with 3=E and 5=L.
So structure is: [1] [2] E [4] L

H must be in 1 or 2.

Option 1: H in 1 → H _ E _ L
   – try H U E K L – not a word
   – H E E _ L – invalid
   – H I E K L – possible
   – H I E C L – C already out
   – H I E B L – “HIE” is word but not sure
   – H I E G L – “HIEG” not word
   – H U E G L – not a word

Option 2: H in 2 → _ H E _ L
   – M H E _ L – not common
   – B H E _ L – nope
   – P H E _ L – try P H E K L – no
   – U H E _ L – no
   – G H E _ L – no
   – W H E _ L – no
   – K H E _ L – no
   – V H E _ L – no
   – B H E E L – duplicate
   – W H E E L – duplicate

Let me rethink common 5-letter words with E in 3 and L in 5, H somewhere.

Word list brainstorm:
- WHEEL – but double E, and W/H/E/E/L – but we know H must be in word, L in 5, E in 3. So W H E _ L → WHEEL fits except double E. But E is fixed only at 3, so okay.
But we have to test new letters in 4.

Actually, we need to test a new letter in 4. We haven’t used B, G, K, M, P, U, V, W yet.

Let me try a word that fits H _ E _ L and uses one of these.

Candidate: H U E K L – not valid
Candidate: H U E G L – not valid
Candidate: H U E M L – not valid

Wait, perhaps H in 2 is better.

Candidate: M H E L L – but double L is allowed, but L is fixed at 5, so M H E _ L. 

Let me try a real word: “UPHEL” – no.

Real words fitting _ H E _ L:
- CHEEL – not common
- SHELF – S is out
- SHELL – S out
- THEWL – archaic
- PHEAL – no

Real word: “WHELP” – but ends with P, not L.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E, not L.

Real word: “CHIEL” – C is out.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but P, H, I, A, L – A is out, I was “-”.

Hmm, let me try “KNELL” – K, N, E, L, L – N is out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out, ends with N.

Real word: “REBEL” – R is out.

Real word: “LEVEL” – V, L, E, V, L – L at 5, E at 3, V is new, but double L and double V.

Let me try “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – E is at 3, L at 5, B and V are new. Fits.

But we need H in word.

Real word: “HEBEL” – not common.

Real word: “HEXAL” – X is rare.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words with E in 3, L in 5, and H somewhere.

Real words:
- AHEML – no
- C H E E L – C out
- W H E E L – W, H, E, E, L – this uses H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W and E new. E is already placed, W is new.

But we have to test new letters in 4. In WHEEL, position 4 is E, which is already in word. Maybe not optimal.

Alternative: “THESE” – but ends with E, not L.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “DEBEL” – D out.

Real word: “PEBEL” – no.

Real word: “KEVEL” – K, E, V, E, L – K and V new. E at 3, L at 5.

Let me try “KEVEL” – but seems rare.

Real word: “MEVEL” – no.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – this is valid.

But we have H must be in word.

Real word: “HAVEL” – A is out.

Real word: “HIVEL” – not word.

Real word: “HOVEL” – O is out.

Real word: “HEVEL” – no.

Real word: “HEVEL” – not valid.

Real word: “HELVE” – ends with E.

Real word: “HELIX” – ends with X.

Real word: “HELLO” – ends with O.

Real word: “HENGE” – ends with E.

Seems stuck. Let me think of words ending with EL where H is second letter.

Real word: “CHEEL” – C out.

Real word: “SHELF” – ends with F.

Real word: “SHELL” – ends with L, but S is out.

Real word: “THELF” – not word.

Real word: “THEIR” – ends with R.

Real word: “THEIR” – not ending with L.

Real word: “THIEL” – not common.

Real word: “PHIAL” – ends with L, but A is out.

Real word: “CHILL” – ends with L, C out.

Real word: “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, L in 5, W new.

Let’s try WHEEL:
Positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=E, 4=E, 5=L

This gives us:
- H in 2 (possible)
- E in 3 (correct)
- W and new E in 4 (E already known, but tests W)
- L in 5 (correct? we don’t know yet if L is at 5, but we have to test)

Actually, we know L must be in 5 because it can’t be 1-4. So word ends with EL, E is at 3, so word is ? ? E ? L.

But we have H must be in 1 or 2.

Real word: “BEVEL” – B, E, V, E, L – but no H.

Real word: “LEVEL” – L, E, V, E, L – L at 5, E at 3, V new – but no H.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “KNELL” – N out.

Real word: “MELON” – N out.

Real word: “HELVE” – H, E, L, V, E – ends with E.

Wait, let me list 5-letter words ending with EL where E is at 3:

Actually, word structure is [1][2]E[4]L and must include H.

Possible words:
- “THE EL” – not 5 letters.
- “SHELF” – ends with F.
- “SHELL” – ends with L, S out.
- “WHILE” – ends with E.

Real word: “REBEL” – R out.

Real word: “BEVEL” – no H.

Real word: “WHEAL” – A out.

Real word: “WHEEL” – ends with L, H in 2, E in 3, W in 1, E in 4.

Only valid common word seems “WHEEL” despite double E.

Let me choose “WHEEL” to test:
- W (new)
- H (new, in 2)
- E (correct at 3)
- E (already known)
- L (must be at 5)

This will confirm if H is at 2 and L at 5.

From the newest feedback (WHEEL):
- W is not in the word (x)
- H is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (-)
- L is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

Now we can tighten the constraints:

1. Letters we know must appear:
   - L – cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → the only position left is 1.  
     Therefore **L must be in position 1**.
   - E – cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → the only position left is… none.  
     This is impossible: we had been told E is in the word but every position has been excluded.  
     The only way this can be reconciled is if the “E(-)” on Guess 5 is interpreted as “E is in the word but not in 3 or 4, and not yet pinned elsewhere,” so let me re-examine the history:

History for E:
- Guess 1 (SLATE): E in position 5 → (-)  
- Guess 2 (OLDEN): E in position 4 → (-)  
- Guess 3 (FLIER): E in position 2 → (-)  
- Guess 4 (LECHY): E in position 3 → (✓)  ← this fixed E at 3  
- Guess 5 (WHEEL): E appears twice; position-3 E is already ✓; the second E (position 4) gives (-) – no new exclusion.

So the “E(-)” on Guess 5 only refers to the fourth letter; E at position 3 is already validated.  
Hence E is fixed at position 3.

2. Letters we know must appear (additional):
   - H – cannot be in position 2. So H can be 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
     But position 1 is L, position 3 is E, so H must be in 4 or 5.

3. Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all “x” marks):
   S, A, T, O, D, N, F, R, C, Y, W

4. Remaining usable letters (common ones):
   B, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, etc.

Current fixed pattern:
L _ E _ _

with H in 4 or 5, and the remaining gaps filled from the available letters.

Let’s try the two cases:

Case 1 – H in position 4:
Pattern: L _ E H _
Need a consonant for position 2 and 5 from remaining usable letters (avoiding known misses).

Candidate consonants left: B, G, I, K, M, P, U, V

Real candidate: “LEMUR” – but R is out.  
Real candidate: “LEVER” – R out.  
Real candidate: “LEVEL” – L at 5 is ok, H is missing.  

Hmm, the only valid word I can think of that fits L _ E _ H and uses remaining letters is “LEIGH” (a common surname).

Check: L, E, I, G, H  
- L in 1 ✓ (fixed)  
- E in 3 ✓ (fixed)  
- H in 5 ✓ (allowed)
