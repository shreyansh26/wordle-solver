For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels. ""STARE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This word will help me quickly determine which of these important letters are present in the secret word and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is correct in the 1st position (✓)
- T is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. Word has no T or A.
3. Word contains R and E, just not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Let’s build a new word:
- First letter must be S.
- R must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- No T or A, and we already used S.

Good letters to try next: common remaining ones like L, N, I, O, C, K, etc.

A possible word: S L I D E. This has:
- S in position 1 (locked).
- E in position 5 (but earlier feedback said E is not in position 5) → no.

Next try: S W I R E. This has:
- S in position 1 (locked).
- R in position 4 (but earlier feedback said R is not in position 4) → no.

Next: S P O R E. This has:
- S in position 1 (locked).
- R in position 4 (again, not allowed) → no.

Next: S E R V E. But E is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). This seems valid.

But let me think of a better mix. How about S H I E R:
- S in 1 (locked).
- R in 5 (allowed, since R was not in 4, now in 5).
- E in 4 (allowed, since E was not in 5, now in 4).

- S in position 1 (locked).
- R in position 4 (again, not allowed) → no.

Next: S E R V E. But E is in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed). This seems valid.

But let me think of a better mix. How about S H I E R:
- S in 1 (locked).
- R in 5 (allowed, since R was not in 4, now in 5).
- E in 4 (allowed, since E was not in 5, now in 4).
- H and I are new letters.

This gives us new info on H and I while placing R and E in allowed spots.

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. T, A, H, I are NOT in the word (x).
3. R is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5 → R must be in position 2 or 3.
4. E is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5 → E must be in position 2 or 3.
5. Cannot have both R and E in positions 2 and 3 at the same time, so one is in position 2 and the other in position 3 (order unknown).

Possible patterns so far:  
S _ _ _ _ with R and E in positions 2 and 3, and no T, A, H, I.

Remaining unused common letters: N, L, O, U, C, K, D, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R and E in positions 2 and 3:  
""SERVE"" – but V is uncommon, let’s try ""SCREW"" instead.  
- S(1) locked ✓  
- C, R, E, W are unused letters.  
- R is now in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is now in position 4 (but feedback says E cannot be in 4) → invalid.

Next: ""SNEER"" – E in position 3, R in position 4 (invalid as R cannot be in 4).  
Next: ""SNORE"" – O is new, R in 3, E in 5 (invalid as E cannot be in 5).

Next: ""SWORD"" – W, O, R, D – R in 3 (allowed), but E is missing.  
Need to include E.  

Next: ""SPORE"" – P, O, R, E – R in 3 (allowed), E in 5 (invalid).  

Next: ""SOWER"" – O, W, E, R – R in 5 (invalid).  

Next: ""SLOPE"" – L, O, P, E – E in 5 (invalid).  

Next: ""SLORE"" – invalid word.  

Let’s try ""SWORE"" – W, O, R, E – R in 3, E in 5 (invalid).  

Next: ""SCREE"" – C, R, E – R in 3, E in 4 (invalid).  

Next: ""SURGE"" – U, R, G, E – R in 3, E in 5 (invalid).  

Let’s try ""SURER"" – R in 3 and 5, but 5 is invalid.  

Let’s try placing R in position 2 and E in position 3:  
""SREED"" – D is new, E is in 3 (allowed), R in 2 (allowed).  
But ""SREED"" is a valid 5-letter word.

From the three clues:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. T, A, H, I, D are NOT in the word (x).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 → R must be in position 3.
4. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 → E must be in position 2.

So the partially revealed word is:

S E R _ _

Letters already eliminated: T, A, H, I, D.

We still need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) from the remaining frequently-used letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Remaining common letters: N, L, O, U, C, K, M, Y, G, B, F, P, V, W, Z (some already used).

Try to use common consonants or vowels not yet eliminated.  
Valid 5-letter words that fit S E R _ _:

SERUM – uses U, M  
SERGE – uses G, E (but E is already placed once, and second E would repeat)  
SERIC – invalid  
SERIF – uses F  
SERVE – uses V, E (again two E’s)  
SERRY – uses R, Y (R already placed)  
SEROW – uses O, W

Among these, SERUM and SEROW look best for information gain.  
SERUM introduces U (vowel) and M (common consonant) and is a common word.
