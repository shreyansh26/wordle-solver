- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters in English. This will help us gather maximum information about which letters are present in the word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess should use these letters. Here are some good options:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- RAISE (similar to ARISE)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it covers 5 of the most common consonants and the most common vowel. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and possibly their positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the correct position (5th).

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It does NOT contain S, T, A, or R.

Remaining common letters to test: L, N, I, O, C, D, M, Y, U, H, etc.
A good second guess should introduce several new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones.

Good candidates:
- OLDEN (but uses D and N, not super common together)
- LINED (uses L, I, N – all common)
- MONEY (uses M, O, N, E – but O is common, E is known)
- INDEX (but X is rare)
- LEMON (but M and O are common, ends in N, but we need E last)
- CHIDE (C, H, I, D, E – strong mix)

I'll choose ""CHIDE"" as it brings in C, H, I, D, and keeps E in the 5th spot, covering 4 new common letters.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E _ _ _ E (Wait, no: the E is in the 5th spot, so the structure is _ _ _ _ E).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, C, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word: H, I, E (with E in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Contains H and I somewhere in the first four positions.
3. Does NOT contain S, T, A, R, C, D.

Let’s list alphabetically the remaining common letters that could fill the two unknown spots: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- H and I could appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- We need to place H and I, plus two other allowed letters.

Let’s brainstorm:
- The letters H and I could be in any order and positions.
- We need two more letters from the allowed set.

Potential words:
1. H I _ _ E → Hinge? But G is allowed, N is allowed. HINGE: H(✓), I(✓), N, G, E(✓). C(×), D(×) etc. so N and G are fine.
2. _ H I _ E → Whine? But W is allowed, N is allowed. WHINE: W, H(✓), I(✓), N, E(✓).
3. _ _ H I E → Pixie? But P is allowed, X is allowed. PIXIE: P, I(✓), X, I(✓), E(✓) – but H is missing, so fails.
4. _ I _ H E → Niche? N, I(✓), C(×), H(✓), E(✓) – C is forbidden.
5. I _ H _ E → Ihram? Too obscure, and M is allowed, but this is not a common word.

Between HINGE and WHINE, both are valid and common. HINGE covers G and N, WHINE covers W and N. Both are strong. I’ll go with WHINE because W is a bit more common than G in English words.

Check WHINE:
- W: allowed (not in forbidden list).
- H: known to be in the word.
- I: known to be in the word.
- N: allowed.
- E: known to be in the 5th spot.

This seems perfect.
