- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good first word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives good coverage of the most frequent letters in English words while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback:
- AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x) shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That means the word must avoid every vowel A, O, E and the consonants R and S.

Next, I still want to test common vowels (U, I) and consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) while avoiding the eliminated letters.  
A strong second guess is “UNITY” because:
- It introduces two new vowels U and I.
- It tests common consonants N and T.
- Y sometimes acts as a vowel or consonant.
- It contains no letters already ruled out.

If UNITY also fails completely, I’ll still have narrowed further, but it covers new ground quickly.

From the feedback so far:
- All letters in AROSE were rejected (A, R, O, S, E are not in the word).
- From UNITY:
  – U, T, Y are not in the word.
  – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So we know:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ _
- Allowed letters so far: any letters except A, R, O, S, E, U, T, Y.
- We also know N is somewhere in the word but not at position 2.

Common consonants left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z.
I want a word that:
1. Keeps I in position 3.
2. Places N somewhere other than position 2.
3. Tests other common consonants.

Good candidates: BLIND, CLING, FLING, GUILD, etc.
- CLINK: tests C, L, N (not in position 2), K.
- BLINK: tests B, L, N (in position 4), K.
- FLING: tests F, L, N (in position 4), G.

I'll go with CLINK because it tests C, L, N, K while keeping I in position 3 and ensuring N is not in position 2.
