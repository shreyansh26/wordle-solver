For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can provide good information about the presence of vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have a mix of frequently used letters. Some popular choices include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'm going to choose ""CRANE"" because it includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N) that might appear in the secret word. This should give me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ A _ E
We know letters C, R, N are out.  
We need two consonants and one vowel for the 1st and 2nd spots, and one consonant or vowel for the 4th spot.

Letters not yet ruled out: A, E (already placed), plus the rest of the alphabet except C, R, N.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, M, P, D, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong second guess should:
1. Keep A and E fixed in positions 3 and 5.
2. Use new letters we haven't tried yet for the other positions.
3. Avoid C, R, N.

Possible candidates:
- STALE (but L is in position 4, which might conflict with A being in 3)
- PLATE (P, L, T new letters)
- GLADE (G, L, D new letters)

I’ll choose ""PLATE"" because it tests P, L, T while keeping A and E fixed.
