For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters that don't repeat, so I can test as many letters as possible. Some good options might be ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must contain R and S.
- Must NOT contain A, O, E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

I want a word that keeps R and S and introduces new common letters like T, N, I, U, L, etc., while respecting the positional constraints.

Candidate words:
- STRIP – uses S, T, R, I, P. Positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). R is in 3 (allowed), S is in 1 (allowed, not 4). Uses fresh letters T, I, P.
- TRUST – but T is repeated, and we already have S. Not ideal.
- CRISP – C, R, I, S, P. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- DRIPS – D, R, I, P, S. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- BURST – B, U, R, S, T. R is in 3, S is in 4 (forbidden), so no.
- SKIRT – S, K, I, R, T. R is in 4, S is in 1 (allowed). Uses K, I, T.

SKIRT seems good: it places R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests K, I, T.

Another option is STRIP, which places R in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests T, I, P.

Between SKIRT and STRIP, STRIP tests more new common letters (T, I, P) without the less-common K. Let’s go with STRIP.

- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P.

Known facts:

2. Must contain S (not in 1 or 4) and I (not in 4).
3. Eliminated letters: A, O, E, T, P.
4. Useful remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, S, W, Y.
5. Useful remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible placements of I and S:
- I can be in 2 or 5.
- S can be in 2, 3 (but 3 is R), 5.  So S may be in 2 or 5.
- We can’t have both I and S in 2 and 5 because only one letter per position.

- If I is in 2: _ I R _ _
   Then S must be in 5: _ I R _ S
- If S is in 2: _ S R _ _
   Then I must be in 5: _ S R _ I

Let’s explore the first option: _ I R _ S.  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4 (not A, O, E, T, P).  
We have already used I and S, so remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, W, Y, etc.

Common words ending in IRS:
- F, C, D, H, L, M, N, W, etc. for the first letter.
Examples: “FIRST” – but T is out.
“BIRDS” – B isn’t out, I, R, D, S – D is allowed. But we already have R in 3 and S in 5.
“CIRCS” – invalid.
“DIRTS” – T out.
“FIRMS” – M allowed.
“FIRMS” fits: F, I, R, M, S.  R is in 3, S in 5.  Uses F and M.
“WIRDS” – invalid.
“BIRDS” – B is allowed.
“BIRDS” is valid: B, I, R, D, S.  R in 3, S in 5.  Uses B and D.

Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

I want a word that keeps R and S and introduces new common letters like T, N, I, U, L, etc., while respecting the positional constraints.

Candidate words:
- STRIP – uses S, T, R, I, P. Positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). R is in 3 (allowed), S is in 1 (allowed, not 4). Uses fresh letters T, I, P.
- TRUST – but T is repeated, and we already have S. Not ideal.
- CRISP – C, R, I, S, P. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- DRIPS – D, R, I, P, S. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- BURST – B, U, R, S, T. R is in 3, S is in 4 (forbidden), so no.
- SKIRT – S, K, I, R, T. R is in 4, S is in 1 (allowed). Uses K, I, T.

SKIRT seems good: it places R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests K, I, T.

Another option is STRIP, which places R in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests T, I, P.

Between SKIRT and STRIP, STRIP tests more new common letters (T, I, P) without the less-common K. Let’s go with STRIP.

Combined with the earlier feedback (AROSE):
- R is in the word, now confirmed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: _ _ R _ _
2. Must contain S (not in 1 or 4) and I (not in 4).
3. Eliminated letters: A, O, E, T, P.
4. Useful remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, S, W, Y.
5. Useful remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible placements of I and S:
- I can be in 2 or 5.
- S can be in 2, 3 (but 3 is R), 5.  So S may be in 2 or 5.
- We can’t have both I and S in 2 and 5 because only one letter per position.

Let’s try:
- If I is in 2: _ I R _ _
   Then S must be in 5: _ I R _ S
- If S is in 2: _ S R _ _
   Then I must be in 5: _ S R _ I

Let’s explore the first option: _ I R _ S.  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4 (not A, O, E, T, P).  
We have already used I and S, so remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, W, Y, etc.

Common words ending in IRS:
- F, C, D, H, L, M, N, W, etc. for the first letter.
Examples: “FIRST” – but T is out.
“BIRDS” – B isn’t out, I, R, D, S – D is allowed. But we already have R in 3 and S in 5.
“CIRCS” – invalid.
“DIRTS” – T out.

“FIRMS” fits: F, I, R, M, S.  R is in 3, S in 5.  Uses F and M.

“BIRDS” is valid: B, I, R, D, S.  R in 3, S in 5.  Uses B and D.

Letters eliminated so far: A, O, E, T, P, B, D, G, L

- C I R U S → “CIRUS” isn’t the standard spelling; “CIRUS” isn’t a word.  

The only common, valid word left is “FIRNS” (firns = snow patches), but “FIRMS” already had M which is allowed. However, we need to check if M is still allowed. Actually, M hasn’t been eliminated yet. Let me double-check the eliminated letters: A, O, E, T, P, B, D, G, L. M is still allowed. So both “FIRMS” and “FIRNS” are possible, but “FIRMS” is more common.

Wait, but we’ve already seen “FIRMS” earlier as a candidate. We have to pick a new word that hasn’t been guessed yet. Since “FIRMS” wasn’t guessed, it’s available. However, let’s check if there are other possibilities.

Also, “CIRUS” isn’t valid. “CIRKS” isn’t valid. “FIRNS” is valid.

Let me choose “FIRNS” because it tests N in position 4.

But actually, “FIRMS” tests M in position 4. Both are valid. Since we haven’t guessed either yet, and we’re narrowing down, let’s choose the more common “FIRMS”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must contain R and S.
- Must NOT contain A, O, E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

I want a word that keeps R and S and introduces new common letters like T, N, I, U, L, etc., while respecting the positional constraints.

Candidate words:
- STRIP – uses S, T, R, I, P. Positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). R is in 3 (allowed), S is in 1 (allowed, not 4). Uses fresh letters T, I, P.
- TRUST – but T is repeated, and we already have S. Not ideal.
- CRISP – C, R, I, S, P. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- DRIPS – D, R, I, P, S. R is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- BURST – B, U, R, S, T. R is in 3, S is in 4 (forbidden), so no.
- SKIRT – S, K, I, R, T. R is in 4, S is in 1 (allowed). Uses K, I, T.

SKIRT seems good: it places R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests K, I, T.

Another option is STRIP, which places R in 3 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), and tests T, I, P.

Between SKIRT and STRIP, STRIP tests more new common letters (T, I, P) without the less-common K. Let’s go with STRIP.

- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: _ _ R _ _
2. Must contain S (not in 1 or 4) and I (not in 4).
3. Eliminated letters: A, O, E, T, P.
4. Useful remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, S, W, Y.
5. Useful remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible placements of I and S:
- I can be in 2 or 5.
- S can be in 2, 3 (but 3 is R), 5.  So S may be in 2 or 5.
- We can’t have both I and S in 2 and 5 because only one letter per position.

Let’s try:
- If I is in 2: _ I R _ _
   Then S must be in 5: _ I R _ S
- If S is in 2: _ S R _ _
   Then I must be in 5: _ S R _ I

Let’s explore the first option: _ I R _ S.  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4 (not A, O, E, T, P).  
We have already used I and S, so remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, W, Y, etc.

Common words ending in IRS:
- F, C, D, H, L, M, N, W, etc. for the first letter.
Examples: “FIRST” – but T is out.
“BIRDS” – B isn’t out, I, R, D, S – D is allowed. But we already have R in 3 and S in 5.
“CIRCS” – invalid.
“DIRTS” – T out.
“FIRMS” – M allowed.
“FIRMS” fits: F, I, R, M, S.  R is in 3, S in 5.  Uses F and M.
“WIRDS” – invalid.
“BIRDS” – B is allowed.
“BIRDS” is valid: B, I, R, D, S.  R in 3, S in 5.  Uses B and D.

Let’s try BIRDS.

Check constraints:
- B: allowed.
- I: allowed, not in 4 (ok, it’s in 2).
- R: in 3 ✓
- D: allowed.
- S: allowed, not in 1 or 4 (ok, it’s in 5).

   We need two more unique letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the still-allowed consonants:  
   C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, W, Y, plus vowel U (the only other vowel not yet eliminated).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We know the exact pattern now:

- Position 2: I ✓  
- Position 3: R ✓  
- Position 5: S ✓  

Letters eliminated so far: A, O, E, T, P, B, D, G, L  

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ I R _ S

Remaining candidates must place consonants in positions 1 and 4 from the still-allowed set: C, F, H, K, M, N, W, Y, plus the vowel U.

Quick scan:

- C I R ? S → CIRKS (invalid), CIRUS (invalid)  
- F I R ? S → FIRMS (M allowed), FIRNS (N allowed)  
- H I R ? S → HIRDS (D out), HIRKS (rare), HIRNS (rare)  
- M I R ? S → MIRKS (rare), MIRRS (invalid)  
- N I R ? S → NIRLS (invalid)  
- W I R ? S → WIRDS (D out), WIRKS (rare)  
- Y I R ? S → none  
- C I R U S → “CIRUS” isn’t the standard spelling; “CIRUS” isn’t a word.  

The only common, valid word left is “FIRNS” (firns = snow patches), but “FIRMS” already had M which is allowed. However, we need to check if M is still allowed. Actually, M hasn’t been eliminated yet. Let me double-check the eliminated letters: A, O, E, T, P, B, D, G, L. M is still allowed. So both “FIRMS” and “FIRNS” are possible, but “FIRMS” is more common.

Wait, but we’ve already seen “FIRMS” earlier as a candidate. We have to pick a new word that hasn’t been guessed yet. Since “FIRMS” wasn’t guessed, it’s available. However, let’s check if there are other possibilities.

Also, “CIRUS” isn’t valid. “CIRKS” isn’t valid. “FIRNS” is valid.

Let me choose “FIRNS” because it tests N in position 4.

But actually, “FIRMS” tests M in position 4. Both are valid. Since we haven’t guessed either yet, and we’re narrowing down, let’s choose the more common “FIRMS”.
