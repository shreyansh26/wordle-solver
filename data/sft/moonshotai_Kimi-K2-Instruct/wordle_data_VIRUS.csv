For the first guess, we want a word that will give us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain. The ideal starting word contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels/consonants are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""STARE"" for similar reasons - contains three vowels (though A is repeated) and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more distinct vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word:
- contains R and S at positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.  
- does not contain A, O or E.  
- the remaining letters may be T, L, N, I, U, Y, etc.

I should pick a word that tests new common consonants and vowels while keeping R and S somewhere else. Good candidates:

- STRIP – puts S first (allowed), R third (allowed), tests T, I, P.  
- CRISP – C may be new, R second (disallowed), so skip.  
- RUSTY – R first (allowed), S third (allowed), tests U, T, Y.  
- TRUST – T first, R second (disallowed), skip.

I’ll go with TRUST: it places T first, R second (disallowed), so that’s bad.  
Better: STRIP (S first, R third, I fourth). OR CRUST (C, R second bad).  

RUSTY seems best: R first, U second, S third, T fourth, Y fifth. It tests U and Y while placing R and S in new positions.

From the feedback:

- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Forbidden letters: A, O, E, U, T, Y, D, P and now fixed S in position 5.

Positions confirmed:
S is fixed at position 5 → word ends with “… S”

R must be in position 1, 4, or 5; but 5 is S, so R must be in 1 or 4.

I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5; but 5 is S, so I can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining usable letters (common ones not yet ruled out): N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, M, plus the vowel I.

We need 3 more letters (positions 1-4 minus R and I) from: N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, M.

Possible valid patterns (remembering S is last):

1. R _ _ _ S  (R in position 1)
   - R must be first, I must be in 2 or 3, remaining letters from allowed set.
   Example: R I N G S → test R, I, N, G, S

2. _ _ _ R S  (R in position 4)
   - R in position 4, I must be in 1, 2, or 3, remaining letters from allowed set.
   Example: C R I N S → but R is in position 2 here (invalid), so not this.

Better to test R in position 1 first to see if that narrows things further. So let’s test R I N G S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that will give us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain. The ideal starting word contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels/consonants are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""STARE"" for similar reasons - contains three vowels (though A is repeated) and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more distinct vowels.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word:
- contains R and S at positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.  
- does not contain A, O or E.  
- the remaining letters may be T, L, N, I, U, Y, etc.

I should pick a word that tests new common consonants and vowels while keeping R and S somewhere else. Good candidates:

- STRIP – puts S first (allowed), R third (allowed), tests T, I, P.  
- CRISP – C may be new, R second (disallowed), so skip.  
- RUSTY – R first (allowed), S third (allowed), tests U, T, Y.  
- TRUST – T first, R second (disallowed), skip.

I’ll go with TRUST: it places T first, R second (disallowed), so that’s bad.  
Better: STRIP (S first, R third, I fourth). OR CRUST (C, R second bad).  

RUSTY seems best: R first, U second, S third, T fourth, Y fifth. It tests U and Y while placing R and S in new positions.

Let’s try RUSTY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary so far:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, Y, U  
Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): R, S  
Positions that are NOT correct for each:
- R is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RUSTY)
- S is not in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and RUSTY)

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3, 4 or 5
- S must be in position 1, 2 or 5
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the unused frequent consonants: N, L, I, D, P, C, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc. and the vowel I is still allowed (since only A, O, E, U are eliminated).

Good strategy: pick a word that
1. Uses R and S in positions not ruled out (R in 3/4/5, S in 1/2/5)
2. Tests new consonants and the vowel I
3. Avoids A, O, E, U, T, Y

Candidate words meeting these rules:
- CRISP – C, I, P; R in 2 (invalid), so skip
- RISKY – Y invalid
- IRONS – O invalid
- DRIPS – D, I, P; R in 3 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed) – looks good
- SPRIG – S in 1, R in 3, I, G – also good
- GRIPS – G, R in 2 (invalid), so skip

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,VIRUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that will give us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain. The ideal starting word contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels/consonants are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""STARE"" for similar reasons - contains three vowels (though A is repeated) and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more distinct vowels.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Thus the secret word:
- contains R and S at positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.  
- does not contain A, O or E.  
- the remaining letters may be T, L, N, I, U, Y, etc.

I should pick a word that tests new common consonants and vowels while keeping R and S somewhere else. Good candidates:

- STRIP – puts S first (allowed), R third (allowed), tests T, I, P.  
- CRISP – C may be new, R second (disallowed), so skip.  
- RUSTY – R first (allowed), S third (allowed), tests U, T, Y.  
- TRUST – T first, R second (disallowed), skip.

I’ll go with TRUST: it places T first, R second (disallowed), so that’s bad.  
Better: STRIP (S first, R third, I fourth). OR CRUST (C, R second bad).  

RUSTY seems best: R first, U second, S third, T fourth, Y fifth. It tests U and Y while placing R and S in new positions.

Let’s try RUSTY.

<guess>RUSTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RUSTY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(-) S(-) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary so far:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, Y, U  
Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): R, S  
Positions that are NOT correct for each:
- R is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RUSTY)
- S is not in position 3 or 4 (from AROSE and RUSTY)

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3, 4 or 5
- S must be in position 1, 2 or 5
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the unused frequent consonants: N, L, I, D, P, C, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc. and the vowel I is still allowed (since only A, O, E, U are eliminated).

Good strategy: pick a word that
1. Uses R and S in positions not ruled out (R in 3/4/5, S in 1/2/5)
2. Tests new consonants and the vowel I
3. Avoids A, O, E, U, T, Y

Candidate words meeting these rules:
- CRISP – C, I, P; R in 2 (invalid), so skip
- RISKY – Y invalid
- IRONS – O invalid
- DRIPS – D, I, P; R in 3 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed) – looks good
- SPRIG – S in 1, R in 3, I, G – also good
- GRIPS – G, R in 2 (invalid), so skip

Between DRIPS and SPRIG, let’s choose DRIPS: it places R in position 3 (allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed), introduces D, I, P.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

Known letters:
- S is in the word and now FIXED in position 5.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Forbidden letters: A, O, E, U, T, Y, D, P and now fixed S in position 5.

Positions confirmed:
S is fixed at position 5 → word ends with “… S”

R must be in position 1, 4, or 5; but 5 is S, so R must be in 1 or 4.

I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5; but 5 is S, so I can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining usable letters (common ones not yet ruled out): N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, M, plus the vowel I.

We need 3 more letters (positions 1-4 minus R and I) from: N, L, C, G, H, B, F, K, M.

Possible valid patterns (remembering S is last):

1. R _ _ _ S  (R in position 1)
   - R must be first, I must be in 2 or 3, remaining letters from allowed set.
   Example: R I N G S → test R, I, N, G, S

2. _ _ _ R S  (R in position 4)
   - R in position 4, I must be in 1, 2, or 3, remaining letters from allowed set.
   Example: C R I N S → but R is in position 2 here (invalid), so not this.

Better to test R in position 1 first to see if that narrows things further. So let’s test R I N G S.

RINGS fits all current constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- N, G in positions 3,4 (new letters)
- S in position 5 (fixed and correct)

So:
- R must be in position 4
- I is in position 2
- S is in position 5
- Positions 1 and 3 need to be filled with letters not yet tested, from remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M
