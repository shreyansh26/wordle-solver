For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained about the secret word. Common starting letters include S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N, L, C. Among these, S, T, R, A, E are very common in English words. A good strategy is to pick a word with no repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. ""STARE"" is a popular first guess because it contains all highly frequent letters (S, T, A, R, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

None of the letters S, T, A, R, E appear in the secret word at all.

Common remaining consonants (in rough frequency order) are N, L, C, M, D, P, F, G, H, B, K.  
The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y.  
A good second-guess word should use new, high-frequency letters and avoid repeats.

We now know:

- O is in the word and in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Letters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D.

Remaining consonants we might try: C, L, F, G, H, B, K, P, Y (if used as consonant), W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, Y (sometimes vowel).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere but NOT in position 4.
3. Only uses letters not in the eliminated set.

Good candidates:
- BONEY: B, O, N, E, Y – but E is eliminated.
- HONEY: H, O, N, E, Y – E is eliminated.
- CONIC: C, O, N, I, C – consonant C repeats, but acceptable.
- GONIF: G, O, N, I, F – fits all rules (O in position 2, N present but not in position 4, no eliminated letters).
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R – E and R eliminated.
- JONES: J, O, N, E, S – E, S eliminated.

“GONIF” seems like a strong candidate following all constraints.

Another safe one is “WONKY” but Y is sometimes tricky. But N must not be in position 4 and O is in position 2 – that would fit “WONKY” (W, O, N, K, Y). However, K and W are less common.

Between GONIF and WONKY, GONIF is better with high-frequency letters.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. O is in the word and is in position 2 (from MOUND and confirmed by COLIN).
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. Letters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D, C, L.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _  
and the word must contain both N and I somewhere.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2, 4, since O is there and N is not in 4 from MOUND and COLIN shows N not in 5).
Possible positions for I: 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2, 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains both N and I.
- Uses only letters not eliminated.

Good possibilities:
- BONNI (invalid, double N and N is in position 4/5)
- GONIF (G, O, N, I, F) – but F is fine and all letters unused. However, N would be in position 3, I in 4. But from COLIN, I is not in position 4 (I(-) means I is in word but wrong position, and in COLIN I was in position 4, so I cannot be in 4). So GONIF would have I in 4, which contradicts the feedback.
- HONING (6 letters) – too long.

Let me re-examine constraints more carefully:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain N and I, neither in positions already shown wrong.
- From COLIN: N is not in position 5 (COLIN had N in position 5 and got N(-) meaning N is in word but wrong position. So N cannot be in 5).
- From COLIN: I is not in position 4 (I(-) means I is in word but wrong position. In COLIN I was in position 4, so I cannot be in 4).

So possible positions:
- N can be 1 or 3
- I can be 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4)

But N and I cannot occupy same position, so possibilities:
- N in 1, I in 3 or 5
- N in 3, I in 1 or 5

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained about the secret word. Common starting letters include S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N, L, C. Among these, S, T, R, A, E are very common in English words. A good strategy is to pick a word with no repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. ""STARE"" is a popular first guess because it contains all highly frequent letters (S, T, A, R, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters S, T, A, R, E appear in the secret word at all.  
I need a new set of letters that were not used in STARE.  
Common remaining consonants (in rough frequency order) are N, L, C, M, D, P, F, G, H, B, K.  
The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y.  
A good second-guess word should use new, high-frequency letters and avoid repeats.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D—but R was already ruled out.  
“MOUND” uses M, O, U, N, D—all fresh letters.  
Another good candidate is “CLINK” (C, L, I, N, K).  
I’ll go with “MOUND” because it incorporates the very common N and D and the vowel O.

- O is in the word and in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Letters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D.

Remaining consonants we might try: C, L, F, G, H, B, K, P, Y (if used as consonant), W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, Y (sometimes vowel).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere but NOT in position 4.
3. Only uses letters not in the eliminated set.

Good candidates:
- BONEY: B, O, N, E, Y – but E is eliminated.
- HONEY: H, O, N, E, Y – E is eliminated.
- CONIC: C, O, N, I, C – consonant C repeats, but acceptable.
- GONIF: G, O, N, I, F – fits all rules (O in position 2, N present but not in position 4, no eliminated letters).
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R – E and R eliminated.
- JONES: J, O, N, E, S – E, S eliminated.

“GONIF” seems like a strong candidate following all constraints.

Another safe one is “WONKY” but Y is sometimes tricky. But N must not be in position 4 and O is in position 2 – that would fit “WONKY” (W, O, N, K, Y). However, K and W are less common.

Between GONIF and WONKY, GONIF is better with high-frequency letters.

Let me also think of C and L. “COLIN”: C, O, L, I, N – this also fits (O in position 2, N present but not in position 4, no eliminated letters). COLIN is also a valid word.

COLIN is a better choice because it includes C, L, I, N and O. Very common letters.

Current confirmed information:

1. The word is 5 letters long.
2. Letter at position 2 = O.
3. The word must contain: N, I (since N(-) and I(-) in feedback means they are in word but wrong positions).
4. Letters eliminated so far: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D, C, L, H, G.
5. Remaining unused common letters: B, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From feedback:
- N is not in position 3 (from HONGI) and not in position 4 (from MOUND) and not in position 5 (from COLIN). So N must be in position 1.
- I is not in position 4 (from COLIN) and not in position 5 (from HONGI). So I must be in position 3 or 4. Wait, from HONGI, I was in position 5 and got I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position. So I is not in position 5. From COLIN, I was in position 4 and got I(-) so I is not in position 4. Thus I must be in position 1, 3.

But position 1 could be N or I. Let's see:

Current pattern:
- Position 2 = O
- Must contain N and I
- N must be in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- Then I must be in position 3 or 5, but 5 is eliminated, so position 3.

Thus pattern: N O I _ _

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained about the secret word. Common starting letters include S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N, L, C. Among these, S, T, R, A, E are very common in English words. A good strategy is to pick a word with no repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. ""STARE"" is a popular first guess because it contains all highly frequent letters (S, T, A, R, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters S, T, A, R, E appear in the secret word at all.  
I need a new set of letters that were not used in STARE.  
Common remaining consonants (in rough frequency order) are N, L, C, M, D, P, F, G, H, B, K.  
The remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y.  
A good second-guess word should use new, high-frequency letters and avoid repeats.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D—but R was already ruled out.  
“MOUND” uses M, O, U, N, D—all fresh letters.  
Another good candidate is “CLINK” (C, L, I, N, K).  
I’ll go with “MOUND” because it incorporates the very common N and D and the vowel O.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUND -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- O is in the word and in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Letters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D.

Remaining consonants we might try: C, L, F, G, H, B, K, P, Y (if used as consonant), W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, Y (sometimes vowel).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere but NOT in position 4.
3. Only uses letters not in the eliminated set.

Good candidates:
- BONEY: B, O, N, E, Y – but E is eliminated.
- HONEY: H, O, N, E, Y – E is eliminated.
- CONIC: C, O, N, I, C – consonant C repeats, but acceptable.
- GONIF: G, O, N, I, F – fits all rules (O in position 2, N present but not in position 4, no eliminated letters).
- POKER: P, O, K, E, R – E and R eliminated.
- JONES: J, O, N, E, S – E, S eliminated.

“GONIF” seems like a strong candidate following all constraints.

Another safe one is “WONKY” but Y is sometimes tricky. But N must not be in position 4 and O is in position 2 – that would fit “WONKY” (W, O, N, K, Y). However, K and W are less common.

Between GONIF and WONKY, GONIF is better with high-frequency letters.

Let me also think of C and L. “COLIN”: C, O, L, I, N – this also fits (O in position 2, N present but not in position 4, no eliminated letters). COLIN is also a valid word.

COLIN is a better choice because it includes C, L, I, N and O. Very common letters.

I will go with COLIN.

<guess>COLIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUND -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: COLIN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) L(x) I(-) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far we know:

1. O is in the word and is in position 2 (from MOUND and confirmed by COLIN).
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. Letters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D, C, L.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _  
and the word must contain both N and I somewhere.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2, 4, since O is there and N is not in 4 from MOUND and COLIN shows N not in 5).
Possible positions for I: 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2, 4).

Remaining letters not yet used (from common pool): B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains both N and I.
- Uses only letters not eliminated.

Good possibilities:
- BONNI (invalid, double N and N is in position 4/5)
- GONIF (G, O, N, I, F) – but F is fine and all letters unused. However, N would be in position 3, I in 4. But from COLIN, I is not in position 4 (I(-) means I is in word but wrong position, and in COLIN I was in position 4, so I cannot be in 4). So GONIF would have I in 4, which contradicts the feedback.
- HONING (6 letters) – too long.
- JOINT (J, O, I, N, T) – T is eliminated.
- KONIG – invalid word.
- PIONY – invalid word.
- WONKY – Y is ok, but N is in position 3, I is not present.
- PINON – P, I, N, O, N – N repeats, invalid.
- MINION – 6 letters.
- VINYL – V, I, N, Y, L – L is eliminated.
- PINKO – P, I, N, K, O – O is in position 4, but we know O is in position 2. Invalid.
- JINGO – J, I, N, G, O – O is in position 5, but must be in 2. Invalid.
- GINNY – invalid spelling / double N.

Let me re-examine constraints more carefully:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain N and I, neither in positions already shown wrong.
- From COLIN: N is not in position 5 (COLIN had N in position 5 and got N(-) meaning N is in word but wrong position. So N cannot be in 5).
- From COLIN: I is not in position 4 (I(-) means I is in word but wrong position. In COLIN I was in position 4, so I cannot be in 4).

So possible positions:
- N can be 1 or 3
- I can be 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4)

But N and I cannot occupy same position, so possibilities:
- N in 1, I in 3 or 5
- N in 3, I in 1 or 5

Looking for valid words:
- N in 1, I in 3: N O I _ _
  - NOISE – S, E eliminated.
  - NOISY – S, Y ok, S is eliminated.
  - NOILY – L eliminated.
- N in 1, I in 5: N O _ _ I
  - NOOKI – invalid.
  - NOVII – invalid.
- N in 3, I in 1: I O N _ _
  - IONIC – C, I is in 1, but C is eliminated.
  - IONIA – invalid.
- N in 3, I in 5: _ O N _ I
  - BONJI – invalid.
  - PONGI – invalid.
  - HONGI – H, O, N, G, I – all letters unused, valid word.
  - KONGI – invalid.
  - WONGI – invalid.

“HONGI” fits all constraints:
- O in position 2 ✔
- N in position 3 ✔
- I in position 5 ✔
- Uses only H, O, N, G, I – none eliminated.

Alternative check: “GONIF” was earlier thought but I would be in position 4 which is invalid. So HONGI is correct.

From the feedback so far:

1. Position 2 is O.
2. N is in the word but may not be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (because it got “-” in MOUND position 4, COLIN position 5, HONGI position 3, NOBBY position 1). The only remaining spot for N is position 1, but NOBBY put N in 1 and still got “-”. That appears impossible, so let me re-check:

Actually, NOBBY had N in 1 and received N(-), meaning N is in the word but not in 1. Therefore N is forbidden from positions 1, 3, 4, 5. There is no remaining position for N. Something is wrong.

Rechecking earlier steps:
- COLIN: N(-) means N is in word but not in 5.
- MOUND: N(-) means N is in word but not in 4.
- HONGI: N(-) means N is in word but not in 3.
- NOBBY: N(-) means N is in word but not in 1.

All five positions are ruled out for N. This is impossible, which indicates an earlier word choice may have been invalid or I misread constraints.

But NOBBY is a valid word and feedback is given, so the contradiction is real. The only resolution is that the word does NOT contain N, despite earlier “-” marks implying N is present. This suggests I misread the feedback symbols.

Re-reading: in MOUND, the feedback was O(✓) and N(✓), not N(-). That was my error.

Correct feedback summary:

1. STARE: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x) – none of those letters in word.
2. MOUND: M(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(x) – O is in position 2, N is in position 4.
3. COLIN: C(x) O(✓) L(x) I(-) N(-) – O confirmed in 2, I is in word but not in 4, N is in word but not in 5.
4. HONGI: H(x) O(✓) N(-) G(-) I(-) – O confirmed in 2, N is in word but not in 3, I is in word but not in 5.
5. NOBBY: N(-) O(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x) – O confirmed in 2, N is in word but not in 1.

Thus:
- Position 2 = O.
- Position 4 = N (from MOUND).
- Word must contain I (from COLIN and HONGI) but I is not in 4 or 5. Thus I must be in 1 or 3.
- Letters used so far and eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, M, U, D, C, L, H, G, B, Y.

Available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus I.

Pattern: _ O _ N _

Need to place I in 1 or 3, and choose remaining letters from unused pool.

Case 1: I in position 1 → I O _ N _
  - Third letter unused: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
  - Valid words: IONIC has C (eliminated). IONIA invalid. IOWAN invalid. No obvious valid word.

Case 2: I in position 3 → _ O I N _
  - First letter: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
  - Valid five-letter English words:
    - FOINS – valid (plural of foin, an archaic word for thrust).
    - JOINS – J, O, I, N, S – S eliminated.
    - KOIN_ – no valid word.
    - POINS – valid variant of pons.
    - VOIN_ – invalid.
    - WOIN_ – invalid.
    - XOIN_ – invalid.
    - ZOIN_ – invalid.

Best candidates: FOINS or POINS. S is eliminated, so FOINS is viable.
