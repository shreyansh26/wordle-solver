Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, T and vowels A, E)
- ROATE (uses R, O, A, T, E - all very common letters)
- ADIEU (uses many vowels)
- STARE (uses S, T, R and vowels A, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses the most common letters in English words according to letter frequency analysis. It covers:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good initial feedback to work with.

From the feedback:

1. C is not in the word (x) – eliminate all words containing C.
2. R is in the correct position (second letter, ✓) – word pattern: _ R _ _ _
3. A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – A is somewhere but NOT in position 3.
4. N is not in the word (x) – eliminate all words containing N.
5. E is not in the word (x) – eliminate all words containing E.

So far our pattern constraints:
- 2nd letter is R
- Contains A but not in position 3
- Excludes C, N, E

Good candidate pool:
Words like:
- BRAVO (invalid, has O and V but A is in position 3 – blocked)
- GRASP (invalid, has S and P, but P isn’t high freq)
- DRAMA (invalid, has two A’s, plus M and A in position 3 – blocked)
- TRAMP (contains M and P – but P is low freq)
- FRANK (invalid, has N and E)
- GRAPE (invalid, has E)
- BRAID (has I and D – I is vowel, D common)
- TRASH (has S and H – both common, no forbidden letters)
- DRAIN (invalid, has N and I)
- GRAIN (invalid, has N)

Let’s look at TRASH:
- Letters: T, R, A, S, H
- R is in right spot (2nd)
- A is present but not in position 3 (in TRASH it’s in position 3 – blocked!)

Next: BRISK – contains I and S and K, but K is low freq, plus has S which is useful.

Another: DRAMS – contains M and S, but M is ok.

However, A would be in position 3 – blocked.

Another candidate: GRAFT – F and T are common, but A is in position 3 – blocked.

A better try: BROAD – but contains E? No. Actually, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D
- R is in 2nd (✓)
- A is in position 4 (allowed, not in 3)
- No C, N, E
- Uses common letters

Let me check BROAD:
- Letters: B, R, O, A, D
- R in 2nd (✓)
- A in 4th (allowed)
- No C, N, E
- Good spread of consonants and a vowel

This seems optimal. Let’s go with BROAD.

Updated constraints after two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BROAD → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) A(-) D(x)

Letter inventory so far:
- R is confirmed in position 2 (fixed)
- O is confirmed in position 3 (fixed)
- A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from A(-) in both guesses)
- Forbidden letters: B, C, D, E, N
- Pattern so far: _ R O _ _ with A appearing in position 1 or 5

So the only possible positions left for A are 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding B,C,D,E,N.

Candidate skeletons:
1. A R O _ _  (A in position 1)
2. _ R O _ A  (A in position 5)

Let's list possible letters for the remaining blanks, excluding used and forbidden letters:
Allowed consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: I, U (since A, O are already used, and E is forbidden)

Let’s build possible words:

Option 1: A R O _ _
- A is in position 1
- Need two more letters (positions 4 and 5)
- Position 4: consonant (since O is in 3)
- Position 5: consonant or vowel (but A is already used, and E is forbidden, so only I or U if vowel)

Examples:
- A R O F I
- A R O G I
- A R O H I
- A R O K I
- A R O L I
- A R O M I
- A R O P I
- A R O S I
- A R O T I
- A R O V I
- A R O W I
- A R O X I
- A R O Y I
- A R O Z I

But we need actual 5-letter English words.

Looking at position 5 as vowel I or U:
- A R O M I → ""aromi"" – not a word
- A R O S I → ""arosi"" – not a word
- A R O T I → ""aroti"" – not a word
- A R O U T → ""arout"" – not a word

Alternatively, position 5 as consonant:
- A R O S E – but E is forbidden
- A R O U S – but U is a vowel and S is consonant – ""arous"" – close to ""arouse"" but missing last letter
- A R O M P – not a word

Option 2: _ R O _ A
- A is in position 5
- Need letters for positions 1 and 4
- Position 1: consonant (since A is in 5)
- Position 4: consonant (since O is in 3 and A in 5)

Examples:
- F R O S A – ""frosa"" – not a word
- G R O M A – ""groma"" – not a word
- H R O W A – ""hrowa"" – not a word
- K R O N A – ""krona"" – but N is forbidden
- P R O L A – ""prola"" – not a word
- S R O N A – ""srona"" – not a word
- T R O P A – ""tropa"" – not a word
- V R O S A – ""vrosa"" – not a word
- Y R O M A – ""yroma"" – not a word

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe position 4 is a consonant and position 5 is A, with position 1 a consonant.

Looking for actual words fitting _ R O _ A:

- G R O W A – ""growa"" – not a word
- P R O W A – ""prowa"" – not a word
- F R O S A – ""frosa"" – not a word
- T R O P A – ""tropa"" – not a word
- S C R O A – but C is forbidden
- G R O K A – ""grok a"" – not a single word

Hmm, seems like limited options. Maybe I need to check if A is indeed in position 1 or 5.

Wait, let me list all possible positions for A:

Given:
- A is not in 3 (from CRANE)
- A is not in 4 (from BROAD)
- So A must be in 1, 2, or 5
- But R is in 2, so A cannot be in 2
- Thus A must be in 1 or 5

So possible patterns:
1. A R O _ _
2. _ R O _ A

Let me search for 5-letter English words fitting these patterns with no B,C,D,E,N.

Starting with _ R O _ A:

Looking through common words:
- G R O W A – ""growa"" – no
- F R O S A – no
- P R O L A – no
- S W O R A – but W is allowed, but structure is S W O R A – no
Wait, maybe:
- F R O S A – not a word
- T R O P A – not a word

Actually, let me try A R O _ _:

""AROMA"" – but has M and A in position 4, but A is already in position 1, and we can't have A in 4 (from BROAD feedback – A is not in 4). Wait, in AROMA, A is in 1 and 5, with O in 3, R in 2, M in 4. But A is allowed in 5, and not in 4 – but in AROMA, A is in 1 and 5, M in 4 – that fits!

""AROMA"":
- A (position 1) – allowed
- R (position 2) – ✓
- O (position 3) – ✓
- M (position 4) – allowed (not forbidden)
- A (position 5) – allowed

This fits all constraints:
- No B, C, D, E, N
- R in 2, O in 3
- A present but not in 3 or 4 (it's in 1 and 5)

Therefore, AROMA is a valid guess.

<guess>AROMA</guess>",AROMA,"Updated constraints after two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BROAD → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) A(-) D(x)

Letter inventory so far:
- R is confirmed in position 2 (fixed)
- O is confirmed in position 3 (fixed)
- A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from A(-) in both guesses)
- Forbidden letters: B, C, D, E, N
- Pattern so far: _ R O _ _ with A appearing in position 1 or 5

So the only possible positions left for A are 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding B,C,D,E,N.

Candidate skeletons:
1. A R O _ _  (A in position 1)
2. _ R O _ A  (A in position 5)

Let's list possible letters for the remaining blanks, excluding used and forbidden letters:
Allowed consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: I, U (since A, O are already used, and E is forbidden)

Let’s build possible words:

Option 1: A R O _ _
- A is in position 1
- Need two more letters (positions 4 and 5)
- Position 4: consonant (since O is in 3)
- Position 5: consonant or vowel (but A is already used, and E is forbidden, so only I or U if vowel)

Examples:
- A R O F I
- A R O G I
- A R O H I
- A R O K I
- A R O L I
- A R O M I
- A R O P I
- A R O S I
- A R O T I
- A R O V I
- A R O W I
- A R O X I
- A R O Y I
- A R O Z I

But we need actual 5-letter English words.

Looking at position 5 as vowel I or U:
- A R O M I → ""aromi"" – not a word
- A R O S I → ""arosi"" – not a word
- A R O T I → ""aroti"" – not a word
- A R O U T → ""arout"" – not a word

Alternatively, position 5 as consonant:
- A R O S E – but E is forbidden
- A R O U S – but U is a vowel and S is consonant – ""arous"" – close to ""arouse"" but missing last letter
- A R O M P – not a word

Option 2: _ R O _ A
- A is in position 5
- Need letters for positions 1 and 4
- Position 1: consonant (since A is in 5)
- Position 4: consonant (since O is in 3 and A in 5)

Examples:
- F R O S A – ""frosa"" – not a word
- G R O M A – ""groma"" – not a word
- H R O W A – ""hrowa"" – not a word
- K R O N A – ""krona"" – but N is forbidden
- P R O L A – ""prola"" – not a word
- S R O N A – ""srona"" – not a word
- T R O P A – ""tropa"" – not a word
- V R O S A – ""vrosa"" – not a word
- Y R O M A – ""yroma"" – not a word

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe position 4 is a consonant and position 5 is A, with position 1 a consonant.

Looking for actual words fitting _ R O _ A:

- G R O W A – ""growa"" – not a word
- P R O W A – ""prowa"" – not a word
- F R O S A – ""frosa"" – not a word
- T R O P A – ""tropa"" – not a word
- S C R O A – but C is forbidden
- G R O K A – ""grok a"" – not a single word

Hmm, seems like limited options. Maybe I need to check if A is indeed in position 1 or 5.

Wait, let me list all possible positions for A:

Given:
- A is not in 3 (from CRANE)
- A is not in 4 (from BROAD)
- So A must be in 1, 2, or 5
- But R is in 2, so A cannot be in 2
- Thus A must be in 1 or 5

So possible patterns:
1. A R O _ _
2. _ R O _ A

Let me search for 5-letter English words fitting these patterns with no B,C,D,E,N.

Starting with _ R O _ A:

Looking through common words:
- G R O W A – ""growa"" – no
- F R O S A – no
- P R O L A – no
- S W O R A – but W is allowed, but structure is S W O R A – no
Wait, maybe:
- F R O S A – not a word
- T R O P A – not a word

Actually, let me try A R O _ _:

""AROMA"" – but has M and A in position 4, but A is already in position 1, and we can't have A in 4 (from BROAD feedback – A is not in 4). Wait, in AROMA, A is in 1 and 5, with O in 3, R in 2, M in 4. But A is allowed in 5, and not in 4 – but in AROMA, A is in 1 and 5, M in 4 – that fits!

""AROMA"":
- A (position 1) – allowed
- R (position 2) – ✓
- O (position 3) – ✓
- M (position 4) – allowed (not forbidden)
- A (position 5) – allowed

This fits all constraints:
- No B, C, D, E, N
- R in 2, O in 3
- A present but not in 3 or 4 (it's in 1 and 5)

Therefore, AROMA is a valid guess.",Guess 3: AROMA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(✓) M(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
