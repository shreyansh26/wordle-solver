For the first guess, I want to maximize information gain since I have no prior knowledge. The best approach is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A highly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), E(x) – none of these four letters appear in the secret word at all.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but not in the last position.

So the hidden word:
- Contains S but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (the remaining high-frequency letters are T, N, L, I, S, U, D, etc.).

A good next candidate is “SUILT”:
- S in position 1 satisfies the feedback (not in position 5).
- It avoids A, R, O, E.
- Letters U, I, L, T are all reasonably common and will help narrow things further.

However, “SUILT” isn’t a valid English word.  
Another solid, valid word is “SLUMP”:
- S in position 1, avoiding the 5th slot.
- Contains L, U, M, P – none of which are in {A, R, O, E}.
But let me check a simpler, more common word: “STINK”:
- S in position 1 (good).
- T, I, N, K – none are A, R, O, E.

I’ll go with “STINK”.

Current facts we can deduce from the two previous guesses:

1. Letters known NOT in the word (from AROSE and STINK):
   A, R, O, E, T, I, N

2. Letters known TO be in the word:
   - S, confirmed in position 1 (green ✓).
   - K, confirmed somewhere in the word but not in position 5 (yellow -).

3. Positions still unknown:
   Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 remain to be filled, with the constraint that K must appear exactly once somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it can’t be in position 5).

4. Remaining common letters that have not been eliminated and are worth testing:
   - Vowels left: U (Y is less common, so try U first)
   - Common consonants left: L, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, etc.

I want a word that:
- Starts with S (already locked in by the ✓).
- Contains K in positions 2, 3 or 4 (not 5).
- Uses only letters NOT in the forbidden list {A, R, O, E, T, I, N}.
- Introduces as many new, common letters as possible to narrow the space.

Candidate words fitting these rules:
- SULK Y (invalid, Y is tricky, and needs 5 letters)
- SULKY – invalid (contains Y; also K is position 4, which is allowed, but Y is uncommon)
- SKULL – K in position 2, uses U and L twice, but double L is acceptable
- SLUMP – invalid because P is okay but lacks K
- SPUNK – K in position 5 is forbidden
- SCULK – archaic but valid (contains C, U, L, K with K in position 4)
- SKULk – invalid length
- SUCKS – double S and K in position 4, but repeats S unnecessarily
- SMUCK – K in position 5 is forbidden

Best common word: “SKULL”
- S ✓ in position 1
- K in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses U and L, which are new
- Repeats L, but that’s fine for testing

But let’s verify SKULL is valid; yes, it is.  
Another good one: “SCULK” (variant of skulk), but less common.

I’ll go with the more common “SKULL”.

Alternative check: “PLUCK” – but doesn’t start with S.  
“SLUNK” – invalid, N is forbidden.  
“SLUSH” – H hasn’t been tested, but S repeats and H is uncommon.  

Thus, SKULL remains best.
