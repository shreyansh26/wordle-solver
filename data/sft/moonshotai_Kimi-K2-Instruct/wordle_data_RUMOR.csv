For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. 

A popular starting word in Wordle strategies is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Another strong option is ""CRANE"" which covers C, R, A, N, E. Both are good, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S which is a high-frequency starting letter.

Other good first guesses include: ARISE, ROAST, RAISE, etc. But SLATE seems optimal for maximizing early information.

From the feedback on SLATE, we know that **none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E** appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates these very common letters, so our next guess should avoid them entirely.  

We still have consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels I, O, U to work with.  

A good strategy now is to pick a word that:
1. Uses none of S, L, A, T, E.
2. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
3. Uses other common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

Some strong candidates:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)
- PRIMO (P, R, I, M, O)
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K)

Among these, ""ROUND"" is a good balance of common letters and avoids the eliminated ones.

We now know:

1. **R is the first letter** (✓ in position 1 from ROUND).
2. **O and U are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3**.
3. **N and D are not in the word at all**.

That leaves:
- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 to fill.
- Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z + O, U (but O and U must be in new positions).

We need a 5-letter word starting with **R**, **not** containing S, L, A, T, E, N, D, and **containing** both O and U (but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively).

Let’s think of possible placements for O and U:
- O cannot be in position 2 (was there in ROUND), so possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
- U cannot be in position 3 (was there in ROUND), so possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.

We also need a valid 5-letter word starting with R, with O and U in new positions, and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- **ROBIN** – but this has B, I, N; N is eliminated (x in ROUND).
- **RUMOR** – has U in position 2 (allowed), O in position 3 (allowed), M and R again. But R is already known as first letter, and this repeats R, which might not help much.
- **ROGUE** – has E, which is eliminated.
- **ROCKY** – has C, K, Y, but O is in position 2 (which is allowed), but U is missing.
- **RUCKS** – has S, which is eliminated.
- **GROUP** – has G, R, O, U, P. Starts with G, not R, so invalid.
- **ROUGH** – has R, O, U, G, H. This fits:
   - Starts with R (✓).
   - O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 2 in ROUND but marked -, meaning it's in the word but wrong position; but in ROUND O was in position 2, so it must be elsewhere. Wait: O(-) in ROUND means O is in the word but NOT in position 2. So in new guess, O must not be in position 2. Thus, ""ROUGH"" has O in position 2, which is invalid.
- **ROBIN** – N is eliminated.
- **ROUGE** – has E, eliminated.
- **RUBIO** – has U in position 2, O in position 5. This could work:
   - R, U, B, I, O.
   - R is first (✓).
   - U is in position 2 (allowed, since U was in position 3 in ROUND and marked -).
   - O is in position 5 (allowed, since O was in position 2 in ROUND and marked -).
   - B and I are new letters not yet tested.
   - No S, L, A, T, E, N, D.

""RUBIO"" seems valid. Let me check:
- R, U, B, I, O – 5 letters, starts with R, includes O and U in new positions, avoids all eliminated letters.

Another option: **RUDIO** – but this is not a standard English word.
Another: **RUMBO** – not a valid word.
Another: **RUFIO** – not standard.

""RUBIO"" seems the best available.

But wait – is ""RUBIO"" a valid English word? It appears to be a proper noun (name), not in standard Scrabble dictionary. Let me think again.

Valid alternatives:
- **ROBIN** – invalid (N).
- **ROUCH** – not a word.
- **ROUTS** – has S, eliminated.
- **ROUSE** – has E, eliminated.
- **ROUTE** – has T and E, eliminated.
- **ROUND** – already tried.
- **RUMOR** – has U in position 2, O in position 3. O in position 3 is allowed (was in position 2 in ROUND, so not in position 2 is fine). But is ""RUMOR"" valid? Yes, and it fits:

   - M is new.
