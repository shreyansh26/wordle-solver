For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common English letters to maximize the amount of information I can gather from the feedback. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- This should help me identify which vowels are present and potentially the positions of R or S

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not at the 5th spot).

So the word starts with A, has an E somewhere in positions 2-4, and cannot contain R, O, or S.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4
3. Does not contain R, O, or S

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll try to include additional common consonants to gather more info. A good candidate would be ""ACUTE"" - it starts with A, has E in position 5 (but we know E can't be in position 5, so that's bad). 

Instead, let me try ""ACNED"":
- Starts with A (correct)
- Has E in position 4
- Uses common letters C, N, D which haven't been eliminated
- Doesn't contain R, O, or S

This should help determine if C, N, or D are in the word.

From both pieces of feedback:

- Word starts with A
- Word ends with D
