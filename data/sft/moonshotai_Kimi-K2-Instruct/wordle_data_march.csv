For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Ideally, we'd want to include vowels and common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', and 'N'. A good starting word should have a mix of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains all five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are frequently found in English words. This gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly balanced with vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Contains A and R somewhere, but not in the 1st and 2nd positions (respectively).
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and R in new positions.
- Leaves out O, S, E.
- Uses 3 other letters that are not O, S, E.

Good unused common consonants: T, N, L, C, H, M, D, etc.
Good unused vowel: I, U (A is already known to be present).

Possible candidates: TRIAL, TRAIN, DRAIN, CHART, TRAMP, etc.

However, looking at positions:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE feedback), and R is not in position 2.
- Let's try to place A in position 2 or 3, and R in position 3 or 4.

Example: TRIAL
- T, R, I, A, L
- R is in position 2 (which is allowed, since original R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so it can be in 2, just not in that exact spot? Actually, ""-) means R is in word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- A is in position 4 (original A was in 1, got ""-"", so A can be in 2,3,4,5. Position 4 is allowed).

TRIAL seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 in TRIAL? Wait, no: TRIAL is T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5). So R is in position 2, which was the same position it was in AROSE where it got ""-"". That means R cannot be in position 2. So TRIAL is invalid.

Next candidate: DRAIN

Summary so far:
Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, C, H, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, R

Positions that are still possible:
- A cannot be in positions 1 (Guess 1) or 3 (Guess 2)
- R cannot be in positions 2 (Guess 1) or 4 (Guess 2)

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, C, H, T
- Uses three other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden ones)

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed)

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Place A in one of 2,4,5
- Place R in one of 1,3,5 (different from A’s position)
- Fill remaining three slots with unused letters

Candidate: BRAID
- B, R, A, I, D
- R is in position 2 (but R cannot be in 2 → invalid, original R was in 2 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 2)

- R is in 1 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (allowed, since A was in 1 and 3 before)
- No forbidden letters (O,S,E,C,H,T)
- Uses I and D which are unused

RABID looks valid.

Check positions:
- R in 1: not ruled out (only ruled out 2 and 4)
- A in 2: not ruled out (only ruled out 1 and 3)
- B, I, D: new letters, not forbidden

1. Contains A and R somewhere, but not in the 1st and 2nd positions (respectively).
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and R in new positions.
- Leaves out O, S, E.
- Uses 3 other letters that are not O, S, E.

Good unused common consonants: T, N, L, C, H, M, D, etc.
Good unused vowel: I, U (A is already known to be present).

Possible candidates: TRIAL, TRAIN, DRAIN, CHART, TRAMP, etc.

However, looking at positions:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE feedback), and R is not in position 2.
- Let's try to place A in position 2 or 3, and R in position 3 or 4.

Example: TRIAL
- T, R, I, A, L
- R is in position 2 (which is allowed, since original R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so it can be in 2, just not in that exact spot? Actually, ""-) means R is in word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- A is in position 4 (original A was in 1, got ""-"", so A can be in 2,3,4,5. Position 4 is allowed).

TRIAL seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 in TRIAL? Wait, no: TRIAL is T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5). So R is in position 2, which was the same position it was in AROSE where it got ""-"". That means R cannot be in position 2. So TRIAL is invalid.

Next candidate: DRAIN
- D, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 (same issue as TRIAL). Invalid.

Next candidate: CHART
- C, H, A, R, T
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since original A was in 1)
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in 2)
- No O, S, E.

CHART seems valid.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHART → C(x) H(x) A(-) R(-) T(x)

Summary so far:
Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, C, H, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, R

Positions that are still possible:
- A cannot be in positions 1 (Guess 1) or 3 (Guess 2)
- R cannot be in positions 2 (Guess 1) or 4 (Guess 2)

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, C, H, T
- Uses three other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden ones)

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed)

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Place A in one of 2,4,5
- Place R in one of 1,3,5 (different from A’s position)
- Fill remaining three slots with unused letters

Candidate: BRAID
- B, R, A, I, D
- R is in position 2 (but R cannot be in 2 → invalid, original R was in 2 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 2)

Candidate: RABID
- R, A, B, I, D
- R is in 1 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (allowed, since A was in 1 and 3 before)
- No forbidden letters (O,S,E,C,H,T)
- Uses I and D which are unused

RABID looks valid.

Check positions:
- R in 1: not ruled out (only ruled out 2 and 4)
- A in 2: not ruled out (only ruled out 1 and 3)
- B, I, D: new letters, not forbidden

Thus RABID is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters definitely in the word: A (fixed in position 2), R (somewhere in word).  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, C, H, T, B, I, D.  

Positions ruled out:
- A: 1, 3 (cannot be there) — but we just learned A is actually in position 2 ✓.
- R: 2, 4 (cannot be there) — and now in Guess 3 we see R in position 1 got “-”, so R also cannot be in position 1.

Hence R must be in position 3 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word:
1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2)
2. Must contain R in position 3 or 5.
3. Must use only letters not yet eliminated: {A, R} + any from allowed set: F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possibilities:

- If R is in position 3:

  Example: FARGN → not a word.  
  GARUM → not common.  
  MARLY → not common.  
  NARWH → not valid.

  Example: FAVOR → O eliminated.  
  MAJOR → O eliminated.  
  MANOR → O eliminated.

  LAMER → E eliminated.  
  GAMER → E eliminated.  
  FAKER → E eliminated.  
  PAGAR → not valid.  
  VAMPI → no R.

Wait, let’s search systematically.

Possible real words fitting _ A _ _ R or _ A R _ _ with allowed letters:

- _ A R _ _:
  - GARPY → not a word.
  - FARRO → contains O.
  - LARGO → O eliminated.
  - MARRY → Y allowed, but R already in 3 and Y is allowed. M, A, R, R, Y — but double R not yet ruled out. MARRY has double R, but R is confirmed once. Double letter possible unless proven otherwise. But we only know one R is present. So MARRY is invalid (second R might not exist).
  - JARPY → not a word.
  - HARDY → D eliminated.
  - MARDY → D eliminated.
  - NARKY → K allowed, Y allowed. N, A, R, K, Y → NARKY is a valid word. Letters N, A, R, K, Y. All allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Contains A and R somewhere, but not in the 1st and 2nd positions (respectively).
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and R in new positions.
- Leaves out O, S, E.
- Uses 3 other letters that are not O, S, E.

Good unused common consonants: T, N, L, C, H, M, D, etc.
Good unused vowel: I, U (A is already known to be present).

Possible candidates: TRIAL, TRAIN, DRAIN, CHART, TRAMP, etc.

However, looking at positions:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE feedback), and R is not in position 2.
- Let's try to place A in position 2 or 3, and R in position 3 or 4.

Example: TRIAL
- T, R, I, A, L
- R is in position 2 (which is allowed, since original R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so it can be in 2, just not in that exact spot? Actually, ""-) means R is in word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- A is in position 4 (original A was in 1, got ""-"", so A can be in 2,3,4,5. Position 4 is allowed).

TRIAL seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 in TRIAL? Wait, no: TRIAL is T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5). So R is in position 2, which was the same position it was in AROSE where it got ""-"". That means R cannot be in position 2. So TRIAL is invalid.

Next candidate: DRAIN
- D, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 (same issue as TRIAL). Invalid.

Next candidate: CHART
- C, H, A, R, T
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since original A was in 1)
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in 2)

3. Must use only letters not yet eliminated: {A, R} + any from allowed set: F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possibilities:

- If R is in position 3:
  Pattern: _ A R _ _
  Need two more letters from allowed set.  
  Example: FARGN → not a word.  
  GARUM → not common.  
  MARLY → not common.  
  NARWH → not valid.  
  FARMS → contains S (eliminated).  
  We need real words.

- If R is in position 5:
  Pattern: _ A _ _ R
  Need two more letters from allowed set.  
  Example: FAVOR → O eliminated.  
  MAJOR → O eliminated.  
  MANOR → O eliminated.  
  NAVAR → not a word.  
  GAMER → E eliminated.  
  MANGY → plausible.  
  LANKY → plausible but no R.  
  FANNY → no R.  
  FANCY → no R.  
  MANGY: M A N G Y — letters allowed, R not included → discard.  
  LAMER → E eliminated.  
  GAMER → E eliminated.  
  FAKER → E eliminated.  
  PAGAR → not valid.  
  VAMPI → no R.

Wait, let’s search systematically.

Possible real words fitting _ A _ _ R or _ A R _ _ with allowed letters:

- _ A R _ _:
  - GARPY → not a word.
  - FARRO → contains O.
  - LARGO → O eliminated.
  - MARRY → Y allowed, but R already in 3 and Y is allowed. M, A, R, R, Y — but double R not yet ruled out. MARRY has double R, but R is confirmed once. Double letter possible unless proven otherwise. But we only know one R is present. So MARRY is invalid (second R might not exist).
  - JARPY → not a word.
  - HARDY → D eliminated.
  - MARDY → D eliminated.
  - NARKY → K allowed, Y allowed. N, A, R, K, Y → NARKY is a valid word. Letters N, A, R, K, Y. All allowed.

- _ A _ _ R:
  - MAJOR → O eliminated.
  - MANOR → O eliminated.
  - MANGA → no R.
  - MANGY → no R.
  - FANCY → no R.
  - LANKY → no R.
  - GAMER → E eliminated.
  - VAPOR → O eliminated.
  - PAGAR → not a word.
  - NAMUR → not a word.
  - JAMMY → no R.
  - KARST → S eliminated.
  - KARMA → M already used, but M is allowed; A in 2 is fixed; K, A, R, M, A → KARMA has A in 2 and 4 — possible. Letters K, A, R, M, A. All allowed. R in 4 — but in Guess 2 CHART had R in 4 and got “-”, so R cannot be in 4. Thus KARMA invalid.
  - PANGR → not a word.
  - WAGER → E eliminated.
  - YAGER → E eliminated.
  - ZAMAR → not a word.

Thus the only valid candidate we can confirm is NARKY.

Let’s verify:
- NARKY: N, A, R, K, Y
- A in position 2 ✓ (matches feedback)
- R in position 3 (not ruled out: ruled out positions for R are 1, 2, 4) → allowed
- Letters N, K, Y not yet eliminated
- No O, S, E, C, H, T, B, I, D

Therefore, NARKY is a valid next guess.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains all five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are frequently found in English words. This gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters in the secret word early on.

- A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Contains A and R somewhere, but not in the 1st and 2nd positions (respectively).
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and R in new positions.
- Leaves out O, S, E.
- Uses 3 other letters that are not O, S, E.

Good unused common consonants: T, N, L, C, H, M, D, etc.
Good unused vowel: I, U (A is already known to be present).

Possible candidates: TRIAL, TRAIN, DRAIN, CHART, TRAMP, etc.

However, looking at positions:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE feedback), and R is not in position 2.
- Let's try to place A in position 2 or 3, and R in position 3 or 4.

Example: TRIAL
- T, R, I, A, L
- R is in position 2 (which is allowed, since original R was in position 2 and got ""-"", so it can be in 2, just not in that exact spot? Actually, ""-) means R is in word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- A is in position 4 (original A was in 1, got ""-"", so A can be in 2,3,4,5. Position 4 is allowed).

TRIAL seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 in TRIAL? Wait, no: TRIAL is T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5). So R is in position 2, which was the same position it was in AROSE where it got ""-"". That means R cannot be in position 2. So TRIAL is invalid.

Next candidate: DRAIN
- D, R, A, I, N
- R is in position 2 (same issue as TRIAL). Invalid.

Next candidate: CHART
- C, H, A, R, T
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since original A was in 1)
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since original R was in 2)
- No O, S, E.

CHART seems valid.

Summary so far:
Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, C, H, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: A, R

Positions that are still possible:
- A cannot be in positions 1 (Guess 1) or 3 (Guess 2)
- R cannot be in positions 2 (Guess 1) or 4 (Guess 2)

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, C, H, T
- Uses three other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden ones)

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed)

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Place A in one of 2,4,5
- Place R in one of 1,3,5 (different from A’s position)
- Fill remaining three slots with unused letters

Candidate: BRAID
- B, R, A, I, D
- R is in position 2 (but R cannot be in 2 → invalid, original R was in 2 and got ""-"", so R can't be in 2)

Candidate: RABID
- R, A, B, I, D
- R is in 1 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (allowed, since A was in 1 and 3 before)
- No forbidden letters (O,S,E,C,H,T)
- Uses I and D which are unused

RABID looks valid.

Check positions:
- R in 1: not ruled out (only ruled out 2 and 4)
- A in 2: not ruled out (only ruled out 1 and 3)
- B, I, D: new letters, not forbidden

Thus RABID is a good next guess.

Hence R must be in position 3 or 5.

3. Must use only letters not yet eliminated: {A, R} + any from allowed set: F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  - MANOR → O eliminated.
  - MANGA → no R.
  - MANGY → no R.
  - FANCY → no R.
  - LANKY → no R.
  - GAMER → E eliminated.
  - VAPOR → O eliminated.
  - PAGAR → not a word.
  - NAMUR → not a word.
  - JAMMY → no R.
  - KARST → S eliminated.
  - KARMA → M already used, but M is allowed; A in 2 is fixed; K, A, R, M, A → KARMA has A in 2 and 4 — possible. Letters K, A, R, M, A. All allowed. R in 4 — but in Guess 2 CHART had R in 4 and got “-”, so R cannot be in 4. Thus KARMA invalid.
  - PANGR → not a word.
  - WAGER → E eliminated.
  - YAGER → E eliminated.
  - ZAMAR → not a word.

Thus the only valid candidate we can confirm is NARKY.

Let’s verify:
- NARKY: N, A, R, K, Y
- A in position 2 ✓ (matches feedback)
- R in position 3 (not ruled out: ruled out positions for R are 1, 2, 4) → allowed
- Letters N, K, Y not yet eliminated
- No O, S, E, C, H, T, B, I, D

Therefore, NARKY is a valid next guess.

2. Letters 1,4,5 only from allowed set
3. Must not reuse any eliminated letters

From all feedback:

Known so far
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- A and R are fixed in positions 2 and 3 (✓).
- Letters that have appeared only as “x” (absent):  
  O, S, E, C, H, T, B, I, D, N, K, Y, G, U
- Letters that have appeared only as “-” (wrong place, but still in word):  
  M is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from GARUM feedback M(-)).

Allowed letters left (unused and not yet eliminated):  
F, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
(plus M, but M must be placed somewhere other than position 5).

Thus the remaining three blanks (positions 1, 4, 5) must be filled with:
- One of them must be M (since M is in the word and only position 5 is ruled out).
- The other two spots must be chosen from {F, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}.

Real 5-letter words fitting _ A R _ _ with those constraints:

- FARMS → S already eliminated  
- JARLS → J, A, R, L, S → S eliminated  
- LARUM → U eliminated  
- MARLY → M in 1, A, R, L, Y → Y eliminated  
- PARMA → P, A, R, M, A → no Y or G etc., and M is in position 4 (allowed)  
- VARMA → V, A, R, M, A → same  
- WARML → archaic

The only standard, non-eliminated word fitting the pattern is:

F A R M A  → FARMA (valid word used in place names / brands, but “PARMA” is more widely recognized as a city/food term).  
Between PARMA and FARMA, PARMA is clearly in dictionaries.

Therefore, PARMA is the logical next guess.
