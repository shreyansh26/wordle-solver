For the first guess in Wordle, the optimal strategy is to pick a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm the presence of frequently occurring letters early on. Common starting words include options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Considering letter frequency in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.), I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S: very common consonant
- L: another common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- S: not in word (x)
- L: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E.  
Known: A exists somewhere, but not in position 3.

So far we have vowel A (not in 3rd spot) and no S, L, T, E.  
Other common vowels are O, I, U; common consonants to test are R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.

We still need to test I, O, R, N, etc.  
A good word should:
– contain A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5),  
– avoid S, L, T, E.

Possible candidates:  
- RANCH (R, A, N, C, H) – covers R, N, C, H, and places A in position 2.  
- CHARD – but uses H, C, R, D and A in position 3 (forbidden).  
- CRANK – uses C, R, A, N, K – but A again in position 3.

RANCH seems best: uses R, N, C, H and places A in a new position (2).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N.
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions:
   - A is in position 2.
   - C is in the word and is in position 4.
   - H is in the word and is in position 5.
3. R is in the word but is NOT in position 1.

So the pattern we have is:
- _ A _ C H
- We still need a consonant in position 1 and a vowel or consonant in position 3.
- The letter R must appear somewhere in the word except position 1. The only remaining slots are position 3 (since positions 2,4,5 are already filled).

Thus, the word structure must be:
- Position 1: a consonant (but not S, L, T, N, R)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

Looking for 5-letter words matching "" A R C H "".

Possible consonants for position 1 (common ones not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let's check:
- BARCH – not a valid English word.
- MARCH – valid word.
- PARCH – valid word.
- DARCH – not common (Darcy, but not a word).
- FARCE – doesn’t fit the pattern.

Between MARCH and PARCH, both fit the pattern. MARCH is more common, so I'll choose that.
