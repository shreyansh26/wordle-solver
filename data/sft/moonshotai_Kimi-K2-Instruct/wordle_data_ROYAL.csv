Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll select a word that uses several of these, avoids repeating letters, and gives good coverage.

A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and vowels. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"" are popular starter choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it uses:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the unknown word:
- Contains A, R, and O somewhere among positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is still open too, but the letters are known not to be in their former spots).
- Cannot have S or E anywhere.

Letters still unused and possible (common ones): T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, G, H

I need a new 5-letter word that includes A, R, and O in positions they haven’t been ruled out for, and adds two new letters from the remaining pool.

Good candidates need to place A, R, O correctly (avoiding their former positions) and introduce new letters. Let’s try “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of position 1).

3. O is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5 (from both rounds).
4. S, E, T, I are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word starts with R

We need to place A and O in the remaining four positions (2–5), using only the allowed letters for the remaining spots.

Possible placements for A: 3,4,5  
Possible placements for O: 2,3,4  

A good plan is to pick a word that:
- Keeps R in position 1
- Puts A and O in two of the remaining positions
- Uses two new common letters

Let’s try RANCH:
- R stays in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 BUT we know A is NOT in position 2 → conflict → reject

So far we know:

- R is fixed in position 1 (✓).
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE, RATIO, ROACH).
- Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters definitely excluded: S, E, T, I, U, N, D, C, H.
- Remaining common unused letters: L, G, B, M, F, Y, P, K, W.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RO, has A in position 4 or 5, and fills the remaining two spots with allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- RO _ A _
- RO _ _ A

Let’s try both.

Pattern 1: RO _ A _
Need two new allowed letters for the 3rd and 5th positions. Common remaining letters: L, G, B, M, F, Y, P, K, W.

Let’s pick:
- 3rd: L (common)
- 5th: M (common)

→ ROLAM – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Next try:
- 3rd: G
- 5th: M

→ ROGAM – not valid.

- 3rd: B
- 5th: M

→ ROBAM – not valid.

- 3rd: M
- 5th: B

→ ROMBA – not valid.

Pattern 2: RO _ _ A
Need two new allowed letters for the 3rd and 4th positions.

Good candidates:
3rd and 4th letters: common remaining pairs:
- B and L → ROB LA? No.
- G and L → ROG LA? No.
- B and Y → ROB YA? No.
- G and Y → ROG YA? No.
- L and G → ROL GA? No.
- L and B → ROL BA? No.
- B and G → ROB GA? No.

Real words fitting RO _ _ A:
- ROYAL – uses Y and L; neither Y nor L has been excluded.
- ROMA – too short.
- ROULA – invalid (U is excluded).
- ROGUE – E is excluded.
- ROYAL seems the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Check ROYAL:
- R (1) ✓, O (2) ✓, Y (3), A (4), L (5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since it must be 4 or 5).
- Y and L are not excluded.
- No conflicts.

So ROYAL is a valid next guess.

- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE, RATIO, ROACH).
- Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters definitely excluded: S, E, T, I, U, N, D, C, H.
- Remaining common unused letters: L, G, B, M, F, Y, P, K, W.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RO, has A in position 4 or 5, and fills the remaining two spots with allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- RO _ A _
- RO _ _ A

Let’s try both.

Pattern 1: RO _ A _
Need two new allowed letters for the 3rd and 5th positions. Common remaining letters: L, G, B, M, F, Y, P, K, W.

Let’s pick:
- 3rd: L (common)
- 5th: M (common)

→ ROLAM – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Next try:
- 3rd: G
- 5th: M

→ ROGAM – not valid.

- 3rd: B
- 5th: M

→ ROBAM – not valid.

- 3rd: M
- 5th: B

→ ROMBA – not valid.

Pattern 2: RO _ _ A
Need two new allowed letters for the 3rd and 4th positions.

Good candidates:
3rd and 4th letters: common remaining pairs:
- B and L → ROB LA? No.
- G and L → ROG LA? No.
- B and Y → ROB YA? No.
- G and Y → ROG YA? No.
- L and G → ROL GA? No.
- L and B → ROL BA? No.
- B and G → ROB GA? No.

Real words fitting RO _ _ A:
- ROYAL – uses Y and L; neither Y nor L has been excluded.
- ROMA – too short.
- ROULA – invalid (U is excluded).
- ROGUE – E is excluded.
- ROYAL seems the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Check ROYAL:
- R (1) ✓, O (2) ✓, Y (3), A (4), L (5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since it must be 4 or 5).
- Y and L are not excluded.
- No conflicts.

So ROYAL is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: ROYAL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) Y(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
