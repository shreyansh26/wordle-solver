3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives good coverage of common letters and will help identify which of these important letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on arose:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in the correct position (second letter)
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not in the word
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So far we know:
- The word has R in the second position.
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
- We still have no information about B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word uses letters we haven’t tested yet while keeping R in the second spot. We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels. Possibilities include:
- U, I, T, N, L, D, M, etc.

A balanced word could be BRUIT (B, R, U, I, T), which introduces four new letters and respects the R placement.

- 2nd letter = R
- U and I must appear somewhere (but not necessarily in the order they showed up before)
- None of A, O, S, E, B, T appear anywhere in the word

- PRICK – P, R, I, C, K – no excluded letters, includes I but not U
- DRUID – D, R, U, I, D – uses D twice; still valid, includes both U and I plus D

DRUID satisfies all constraints:
- R is in 2nd position.
- U and I are present.
- A, O, S, E, B, T are absent.
- All letters are unique except D, which appears twice; that’s allowed.
