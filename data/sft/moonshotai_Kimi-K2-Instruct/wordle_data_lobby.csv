1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters and ideally includes different vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two consonants. This will help me gather maximum information from the first guess.

From the first guess (AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)), we know:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the secret word has:
- No A, R, S, E.
- One O somewhere except position 3.

I now need a word that:
1. Contains the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.

Good remaining common letters: I, T, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, Y, F, K, P, W.

I’ll pick a word that has O in position 2 or 4 (to satisfy the position constraint) and as many other common letters as possible. One good candidate is “POINT”:
- Contains O in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses P, I, N, T – all still potentially valid.

Let me check: none of A, R, S, E appear; O is present and not in position 3. This seems perfect.

We need to use only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common consonants and a vowel or two that could fill the other spots are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U.

A good choice is “COULD”:
- C, U, L, D are all still allowed.
- O is in position 2, satisfying the feedback.
- Word uses common remaining letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters and ideally includes different vowels and consonants.

Let’s update what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word and their current positions:
- O is definitely in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback on guesses 2, 3, and 4).  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5.

- L is definitely in the word, but it is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from guesses 3 and 4).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

- Y is definitely in the word and is in the correct position—position 5 (from guess 4).  
  So the pattern ends with Y: _ _ _ _ Y.

Combining these constraints:
- Word ends in Y.
- O must be in position 1 (since 5 is Y).
- L must be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 5 because 1 is O and 5 is Y).

So the two remaining possible patterns are:
1. O L _ _ Y
2. O _ L _ Y

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.  
We’ll pick common letters first: F, G, H, K, M.

Let’s try the pattern O L _ _ Y with F and G:

- OLF _ Y: no valid 5-letter word.
- O L G _ Y: no valid word.
- O L K _ Y: no valid word.

Next, pattern O _ L _ Y:

- O F L _ Y: no valid word.
- O G L _ Y: no valid word.
- O K L _ Y: no valid word.

We need to include another available letter. Let’s try:

- O L F _ Y: no.
- O L M _ Y: no.

Wait, we still have H and K to place.

How about O L M H Y? Not valid.

Let’s try a different combination: O M L _ Y: no.

Another approach: look for valid 5-letter English words ending in Y, starting with O, containing L somewhere in positions 2-4.

Valid words that fit:
- OLOGY (but G is allowed, L is in position 3, O is position 1).  
  Check letters: O, L, O, G, Y – all allowed. OLOGY!

Letters in OLOGY: O, L, G, Y – all still possible, and:
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).
- Y is in position 5 (matches feedback).
- G has not been eliminated.

This seems to satisfy every constraint.

Remaining available letters (not yet eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.  
We’ll pick common letters first: F, G, H, K, M.

Let’s try the pattern O L _ _ Y with F and G:

- OLF _ Y: no valid 5-letter word.
- O L G _ Y: no valid word.
- O L K _ Y: no valid word.

Next, pattern O _ L _ Y:

- O F L _ Y: no valid word.
- O G L _ Y: no valid word.
- O K L _ Y: no valid word.

We need to include another available letter. Let’s try:

- O L F _ Y: no.
- O L M _ Y: no.

Wait, we still have H and K to place.

How about O L M H Y? Not valid.

Let’s try a different combination: O M L _ Y: no.

Another approach: look for valid 5-letter English words ending in Y, starting with O, containing L somewhere in positions 2-4.

Valid words that fit:
- OLOGY (but G is allowed, L is in position 3, O is position 1).  
  Check letters: O, L, O, G, Y – all allowed. OLOGY!

Letters in OLOGY: O, L, G, Y – all still possible, and:
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).
- Y is in position 5 (matches feedback).
- G has not been eliminated.

This seems to satisfy every constraint.

Latest summary of constraints

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, W, G  
(plus the earlier A, R, S, E from guess 1).

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (feedback shows “-” in positions 2 and 3).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1.  
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (four “-” marks across guesses).  
  Therefore O must be in position 5—but position 5 is already Y.  
  The only way this can happen is if the word has two O’s, one of which is in position 5.  
  However, position 5 is already taken by Y, so the only possibility is that O is not actually in position 5.  
  This implies O must be in position 4 (but guess 4 showed O(-) in position 3, and guess 5 showed O(-) in position 1).  
  Wait, let’s re-examine:  
  - Guess 2: O(✓) → O in position 2.  
  - Guess 3: O(✓) → O in position 2.  
  - Guess 4: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 3.  
  - Guess 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 1.  

  So O is in the word and must be in position 2 (from guess 2 and 3), but guess 4 showed O(-) in position 3, and guess 5 showed O(-) in position 1.  
  This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted differently.  

  Actually, the feedback symbols mean:  
  ✓ = correct position,  
  - = in word but wrong position,  
  x = not in word.  

  So:  
  - Guess 2: O(✓) → O is in position 2.  
  - Guess 3: O(✓) → O is in position 2.  
  - Guess 4: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 3 (consistent, since O is in position 2).  
  - Guess 5: O(-) → O is in word but not in position 1 (consistent).  

  So O is in position 2.  

Similarly for L:  
- Guess 3: L(-) → L is in word but not in position 3.  
- Guess 4: L(-) → L is in word but not in position 2.  
- Guess 5: L(-) → L is in word but not in position 2.  

So L must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3 are ruled out for L).  

But Y is in position 5.  

Current pattern:  
L or _ in position 1,  
O in position 2,  
_ in position 3,  
L or _ in position 4,  
Y in position 5.  

Given that L must be in position 1 or 4, and we have no other constraints on the remaining letters except that they must come from the still-allowed set: B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.  

Possible words:  
- L O _ _ Y: need two letters from allowed set for positions 3 and 4, with L in 1.  
- _ O _ L Y: need two letters from allowed set for positions 1 and 3, with L in 4.  

Looking for valid 5-letter words:  
- LOAMY: A is ruled out.  
- LOBBY: B is allowed (B(-) in guess 4 means B is in word but not in position 1; here B would be in position 3 or 4, which is fine).  
- LOBBY: letters L, O, B, B, Y.  
  Check constraints:  
  - L is in position 1 (allowed).  
  - O is in position 2 (matches feedback).  
  - B appears twice; we don’t have any rules against duplicates.  
  - Y is in position 5 (matches).  
  - B was marked B(-) in guess 4, meaning B is in the word but not in position 1; here B is in positions 3 and 4, which is fine.  

LOBBY seems to fit all constraints.
