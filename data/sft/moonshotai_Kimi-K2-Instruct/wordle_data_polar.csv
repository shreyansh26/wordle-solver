For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. Some of the most frequent letters in English words are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good first guess should include several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. One common and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E—covering many high-frequency consonants and vowels. This helps identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

- L is in the word but not in positions 2, 1, or 5. So L must be in position 3 or 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 3, 2, or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 3, 3, or 2. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need to test possible positions for L, A, R while introducing new common letters. The remaining unused common letters include N, O, U, M, G, etc.

Let's consider possible arrangements:
1. If L is in position 3 or 4, and A and R need to fit in positions 1, 4, or 5 (without overlapping with L).
2. A good word would place these letters in new positions and test new letters.

Possible candidates:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in positions 1 and 5 (or 5 and 1)
- Let's test ""RAL"" at the start and end: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R

The word ""AROUL"" comes to mind but U is less common. Let's try ""GROAN"" but O and N are good, but G is less common. 

A better word might be ""MORAL"":
- M, O are new letters to test
- Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5)
But L cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3), and A cannot be in 4 (from Guess 2), R cannot be in 3 (from Guess 3).

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints more carefully:
- L must be in 3 or 4
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5

Let's try:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in 1 and 5: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R
- We need a valid 5-letter word with these patterns.

""ROYAL"" - but Y is out. 
""RENAL"" - but E is out. 
""RURAL"" - but U is new and R is duplicated (but we don't know if letters repeat).

Actually ""RURAL"" uses R twice which might not be optimal. 

Let's try ""MARAL"" - but E is out. 
""FAROL"" - not a word. 
""CAROL"" - C is out. 

""GROAN"" - G, O, N new: positions G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)
But from feedback:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2)
- A cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2)
- L isn't in this word at all (but we know L is in the word)

This is tricky. Let's construct a word that:
- Has L in position 3 or 4
- Has A in 1, 4, or 5
- Has R in 1, 4, or 5
- Doesn't use any of the eliminated letters (S,T,E,D,Y,C,I)

Possible candidates:
- A L _ R _ - but L would be in position 2 (invalid from Guess 1)
- A _ L R _ - L in 3, A in 1, R in 4: ""AULDR"" - but D is out
- _ A L R _ - L in 3, A in 2, R in 4: but A cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2)
- _ _ A L R - L in 4, A in 3, R in 5: but A cannot be in 3 (from Guess 1)
- R _ A L _ - L in 4, R in 1, A in 3: but A cannot be in 3
- _ R A L _ - L in 4, R in 2, A in 3: but R cannot be in 2, A cannot be in 3

This is quite constrained. Let's try:
- L in position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Then A and R must be in 1,4,5
Possible patterns:
- A _ L _ R: e.g., ""AULOR"" - but O is new, U is new
- R _ L _ A: e.g., ""RULOA"" - not a word
- _ A L R _: but this would have A in 2 (invalid)
- A R L _ _: but R would be in 2 (invalid from Guess 2)

The only viable pattern seems to be:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in 1 and 5: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R
Possible words:
- R O U L A - ""ROULA"" - not valid
- R A U L _ - but needs 5 letters
Actually, let's look for real words:
Valid word: ""RURAL"" - but R is repeated and U is new
""FOCAL"" - but C is out
""JURAL"" - J and U new, but J is uncommon
""MOLAR"" - M, O new: positions M(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5)
But:
- L is in 3 - allowed
- A is in 4 - but from Guess 2 feedback, A cannot be in 4 (LARDY had A in 2, feedback was ""-"")
Wait, no - in LARDY, A was in position 2, feedback was ""-"" (in word but wrong position), so A cannot be in 2. It could be in 4.

Similarly:
- R in 5 - allowed (was in 3 in CRAIL, feedback ""-"")
So ""MOLAR"" seems valid:
- Letters: M, O, L, A, R
- Positions: L in 3 (new), A in 4 (new), R in 5 (new)
- Introduces M and O

This seems like the best next guess.

Based on the feedback, I know:
- Letters in the word: L, A, R
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, Y, C, I
- L must be in position 3 or 4
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5

After carefully considering possible valid 5-letter words that fit these constraints and introduce new common letters, the best next guess is:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,polar,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. Some of the most frequent letters in English words are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good first guess should include several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. One common and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E—covering many high-frequency consonants and vowels. This helps identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Known so far:
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: L, A

Next guess should:
1. Include L and A (since they are in the word).
2. Avoid S, T, E.
3. Place L and A in new positions.
4. Use new common letters (R, N, O, I, etc.) to test more possibilities.

A good candidate is ""LARDY"":
- L is now in position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- A is now in position 2 (was in position 3 before).
- R, D, Y are new letters to test.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LARDY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) R(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1: SLATE → letters L and A are in the word but not in their guessed positions.
From Guess 2: LARDY → L and A are again in the wrong positions, and R is also in the word but not in the current position. D and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, A, R
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, Y

We also know the positions these letters cannot occupy:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 1.
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 2.
- R cannot be in position 3.

Good next steps:
- L must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- A must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- R must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that uses L, A, R in new positions and introduces new common letters (like N, I, O, U, C, etc.).

Let's pick ""CRAIL"":
- C and I are new letters to test.
- R is in position 1 (new position).
- A is in position 3 (new position).
- L is in position 5 (new position).

This should help determine the correct positions for L, A, and R while testing C and I.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we've learned from the three guesses so far.

Known letters:
- Letters in the word: L, A, R
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, Y, C, I

From the feedback:
- L is in the word but not in positions 2, 1, or 5. So L must be in position 3 or 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 3, 2, or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 3, 3, or 2. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need to test possible positions for L, A, R while introducing new common letters. The remaining unused common letters include N, O, U, M, G, etc.

Let's consider possible arrangements:
1. If L is in position 3 or 4, and A and R need to fit in positions 1, 4, or 5 (without overlapping with L).
2. A good word would place these letters in new positions and test new letters.

Possible candidates:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in positions 1 and 5 (or 5 and 1)
- Let's test ""RAL"" at the start and end: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R

The word ""AROUL"" comes to mind but U is less common. Let's try ""GROAN"" but O and N are good, but G is less common. 

A better word might be ""MORAL"":
- M, O are new letters to test
- Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5)
But L cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3), and A cannot be in 4 (from Guess 2), R cannot be in 3 (from Guess 3).

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints more carefully:
- L must be in 3 or 4
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5

Let's try:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in 1 and 5: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R
- We need a valid 5-letter word with these patterns.

""ROYAL"" - but Y is out. 
""RENAL"" - but E is out. 
""RURAL"" - but U is new and R is duplicated (but we don't know if letters repeat).

Actually ""RURAL"" uses R twice which might not be optimal. 

Let's try ""MARAL"" - but E is out. 
""FAROL"" - not a word. 
""CAROL"" - C is out. 

""GROAN"" - G, O, N new: positions G(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), N(5)
But from feedback:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 2)
- A cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2)
- L isn't in this word at all (but we know L is in the word)

This is tricky. Let's construct a word that:
- Has L in position 3 or 4
- Has A in 1, 4, or 5
- Has R in 1, 4, or 5
- Doesn't use any of the eliminated letters (S,T,E,D,Y,C,I)

Possible candidates:
- A L _ R _ - but L would be in position 2 (invalid from Guess 1)
- A _ L R _ - L in 3, A in 1, R in 4: ""AULDR"" - but D is out
- _ A L R _ - L in 3, A in 2, R in 4: but A cannot be in 2 (from Guess 2)
- _ _ A L R - L in 4, A in 3, R in 5: but A cannot be in 3 (from Guess 1)
- R _ A L _ - L in 4, R in 1, A in 3: but A cannot be in 3
- _ R A L _ - L in 4, R in 2, A in 3: but R cannot be in 2, A cannot be in 3

This is quite constrained. Let's try:
- L in position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Then A and R must be in 1,4,5
Possible patterns:
- A _ L _ R: e.g., ""AULOR"" - but O is new, U is new
- R _ L _ A: e.g., ""RULOA"" - not a word
- _ A L R _: but this would have A in 2 (invalid)
- A R L _ _: but R would be in 2 (invalid from Guess 2)

The only viable pattern seems to be:
- L in position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Then A and R must be in 1 and 5: R _ _ L A or A _ _ L R
Possible words:
- R O U L A - ""ROULA"" - not valid
- R A U L _ - but needs 5 letters
Actually, let's look for real words:
Valid word: ""RURAL"" - but R is repeated and U is new
""FOCAL"" - but C is out
""JURAL"" - J and U new, but J is uncommon
""MOLAR"" - M, O new: positions M(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5)
But:
- L is in 3 - allowed
- A is in 4 - but from Guess 2 feedback, A cannot be in 4 (LARDY had A in 2, feedback was ""-"")
Wait, no - in LARDY, A was in position 2, feedback was ""-"" (in word but wrong position), so A cannot be in 2. It could be in 4.

Similarly:
- R in 5 - allowed (was in 3 in CRAIL, feedback ""-"")
So ""MOLAR"" seems valid:
- Letters: M, O, L, A, R
- Positions: L in 3 (new), A in 4 (new), R in 5 (new)
- Introduces M and O

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback, I know:
- Letters in the word: L, A, R
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, D, Y, C, I
- L must be in position 3 or 4
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5

After carefully considering possible valid 5-letter words that fit these constraints and introduce new common letters, the best next guess is:

From Guess 4 (MOLAR):
- M(x) – M is not in the word.

- L(✓) – L is correct in position 3.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 5.

So the only unknown letter is position 1, and the pattern is:
_ O L A R

We already know from earlier feedback that the following letters are not in the word:

Looking for a 5-letter word that fits the pattern ?OLAR, the obvious candidate is ""HOLAR"" but that isn't a valid English word. The only common valid word that fits is:

We now know the word ends in ""OLAR"" and we just need the first letter. The only valid 5-letter word that matches is:
