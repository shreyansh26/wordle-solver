For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should use a combination of these frequent letters.

Looking at common patterns, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E.

However, ""CRANE"" is also a strong contender as it has C, R, A, N, E - covering several common letters in good positions. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

All five letters in AROSE – A, R, O, S, E – are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built exclusively from the remaining 17 letters of the alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For a second guess we want to cover as many new, common letters as possible to maximize information.  
Among the remaining letters, the most frequent in 5-letter English words are usually: I, N, T, L, C, D, U, B, M, P, H.

A balanced word using several of these is “UNTIL”.  
- U, N, T, I, L are all new letters not tried before.  
- It places the common vowel “I” in the center and uses consonants N, T, L that are very frequent.

From the feedback we know:

- The secret word contains the letter I in position 3 (✓).
- The letters T and L are somewhere in the word but not in their guessed positions (T not in position 2, L not in position 5).
- The letters A, R, O, S, E, U, N are not in the word at all (x).

So the letters we have left to work with are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and L (which must appear).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3.
- Contains both T and L, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is I). So positions 1, 4, 5.
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is I). So positions 1, 2, 4.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. One approach is to look for common letters among the remaining pool, like M, B, C, H, etc.

A good candidate is ""LIMIT"" - but this uses I twice, and we don't know if there are repeated letters. Also, T is in position 5 here, which is allowed since T's restriction was only that it couldn't be in position 2.

However, ""LIMIT"" uses M and I (already confirmed), but we should check if this violates any rules. Actually, ""LIMIT"" uses I twice, and we only know one I exists. This might not be optimal.

Another candidate is ""TIBIA"" - but this uses A which is excluded.

Looking for words with I in the middle and T/L included:
- ""HITCH"" - but uses H twice, and T is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""PITCH"" - uses P, I, T, C, H. T is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""CLIPT"" - but P is allowed, T is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 2 (allowed), I in 3. This seems valid.

""FILTH"" - F, I, L, T, H. This has I in position 2 (invalid).

""LICIT"" - but uses I twice and C, I, T. I is in position 2 (invalid).

""GLINT"" - G, L, I, N, T. But N is excluded.

Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is I). So positions 1, 2, 4.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. One approach is to look for common letters among the remaining pool, like M, B, C, H, etc.

A good candidate is ""LIMIT"" - but this uses I twice, and we don't know if there are repeated letters. Also, T is in position 5 here, which is allowed since T's restriction was only that it couldn't be in position 2.

However, ""LIMIT"" uses M and I (already confirmed), but we should check if this violates any rules. Actually, ""LIMIT"" uses I twice, and we only know one I exists. This might not be optimal.

Another candidate is ""TIBIA"" - but this uses A which is excluded.

Looking for words with I in the middle and T/L included:
- ""HITCH"" - but uses H twice, and T is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""PITCH"" - uses P, I, T, C, H. T is in position 2 (invalid).
- ""CLIPT"" - but P is allowed, T is in position 5 (allowed), L in position 2 (allowed), I in 3. This seems valid.

Wait, let me think of simpler words. ""BUILT"" - but U is excluded.

""FLINT"" - F, L, I, N, T. But N is excluded from UNTIL feedback.

""TWIXT"" - but X is allowed, but uses T twice.

""BLIMP"" - but no I in position 3.

""VITAL"" - V, I, T, A, L. But A is excluded.

""WITCH"" - W, I, T, C, H. T is in position 2 (invalid).

""FILTH"" - F, I, L, T, H. This has I in position 2 (invalid).

""LICIT"" - but uses I twice and C, I, T. I is in position 2 (invalid).

""GLINT"" - G, L, I, N, T. But N is excluded.

""SHIFT"" - S is excluded.

""QUILT"" - Q, U, I, L, T. U is excluded.

""DWELT"" - but E is excluded.

""CLIMB"" - M is allowed, but no T.

""PLINT"" - N is excluded.

""BLITZ"" - B, L, I, T, Z. This seems valid:
- B, L, I, T, Z all allowed
- I in position 3 (correct)
- T in position 4 (allowed, since T couldn't be in position 2)
- L in position 2 (allowed, since L couldn't be in position 5)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. The secret word contains:
   • I (originally placed at position 3, now shown to be elsewhere)
   • T (may be in any position except 2)
   • L (may be in any position except 5)

2. All letters that have received an “x” are **not** in the word at all:
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, B, Z

3. All other letters of the alphabet are still possible.

Goal
Find a 5-letter word that
- uses only the still-allowed letters,
- contains both T and L,
- contains I exactly once,
- and respects the positional restrictions:
   – I cannot be in position 3,
   – T cannot be in position 2,
   – L cannot be in position 5.

Remaining common letters
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y plus the required trio I, L, T.

A good choice should test several new high-frequency consonants.
“H” is quite common and has not been tried yet.

Candidate check: “LIGHT”
- Letters: L, I, G, H, T → all still allowed
- I is in position 2 (allowed)
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since the only forbidden spot for T was position 2)
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since the only forbidden spot for L was position 5)

No rule violations, and we gain information on G and H.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE – A, R, O, S, E – are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built exclusively from the remaining 17 letters of the alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For a second guess we want to cover as many new, common letters as possible to maximize information.  
Among the remaining letters, the most frequent in 5-letter English words are usually: I, N, T, L, C, D, U, B, M, P, H.

A balanced word using several of these is “UNTIL”.  
- U, N, T, I, L are all new letters not tried before.  
- It places the common vowel “I” in the center and uses consonants N, T, L that are very frequent.

So “UNTIL” is a good next exploratory guess.

So the letters we have left to work with are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and L (which must appear).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3.
- Contains both T and L, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is I). So positions 1, 4, 5.

From the new feedback on LIGHT:

1. L I T are **all** in their exact positions (1-2-5 respectively).
2. G and H are absent.

So the word must look like:
L  I  _  _  T

Letters still allowed (all others except the ones already ruled out):
C, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y

We need a single letter for positions 3 and 4 that has not been eliminated.  
Among the remaining letters, the most common are D, C, K, M, P.

Looking for common patterns:
- L I C K T → ""LICKT"" – but ""LICKT"" is not a valid English word.
- L I F T _ – but position 5 must be T already.
- L I M I T – ""LIMIT"" uses I twice; while not impossible, we have no evidence for duplicates yet.
- L I D T _ – no valid word.
- L I S T _ – S is excluded (from Guess 1).
- L I P T _ – no valid word.

However, ""LIMIT"" is a valid English word, fits all constraints:
- L ✓ at 1
- I ✓ at 2
- M allowed
- I allowed (possible duplicate)
- T ✓ at 5

Given the constraints, ""LIMIT"" is the only common word fitting the pattern.
