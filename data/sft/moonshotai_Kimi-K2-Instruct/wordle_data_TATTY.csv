For the first guess, we want a word that can give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and different vowels/consonants to maximize the chance of hitting or eliminating letters. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback for RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

1. A 5-letter word with A in position 2

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)

   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CANAL → C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)  
   – Second A is present but is not in position 4 (so it must be in 1, 3, or 5).  
   – C, N, L are not in the word.

Therefore we now know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _ (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 still open).  
- No letters: R, I, S, E, C, N, L.  
- The word contains at least one extra A somewhere (because the second A got “-”).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, B, G, M, P, Y, H, K, W, F, V, etc.  
We want a common word that has A in position 2 plus another A in 1, 3, or 5 and none of the banned letters.

Possible candidates:  
BAAED (uses A twice, but contains E which is banned) – invalid.  
TAJAS (contains J and S – bad).  
MACAW (has C) – bad.  
MAFIA (contains F and I) – bad.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – R, I, S, E are absent.

2. CANAL → C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)  
   – Second A is present but not in position 4.  
   – C, N, L are absent.

3. BAHTA → B(x) A(✓) H(x) T(✓) A(-)  
   – T is in position 4 (✓).  
   – B and H are absent.  
   – The second A is present but not in position 5.

So the pattern now is:  
_ A _ T _  
and we still need one more A (because it was “-” in both CANAL and BAHTA) that must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
Banned letters so far: R, I, S, E, C, N, L, B, H.

Candidate letters still allowed: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Word must be 5 letters, have A in 2 and T in 4, and contain exactly one more A in 1, 3, or 5.

Possible positions for the extra A:
- Position 1: A A _ T _  → e.g., AARTY (invalid).  
- Position 3: _ A A T _  → e.g., DAATA (invalid).  
- Position 5: _ A _ T A  → e.g., GATJA (invalid).

Looking for real words, the only common English 5-letter word fitting _ A _ T A with the constraints is “GATJA” (which is obscure) and “DATTA” (also obscure). However, “DATTA” contains D and two T’s, but the word needs exactly one T. 

Next best is “FATAL” but L is banned.  
“PATMA” – M and P are allowed, but it’s not a standard word.  
“VATMA” – V and M, also not standard.  

After checking, “DATTA” is the closest valid option despite its rarity. It fits:
- D in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (fixed)  
- T in 3 (but we know T is in 4, conflict). 

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is _ A _ T _, so position 3 must be the extra A.  
Thus, the form is _ A A T _.  
The only English word fitting this is “CAATT” (invalid). 

Rechecking: we need _ A _ T _ with an extra A in 1, 3, or 5.  
Valid word: “KATTA” – fits _ A _ T A (A in 2 and 5, T in 4).  
Letters: K, A, T (allowed), none of the banned letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and different vowels/consonants to maximize the chance of hitting or eliminating letters. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we need:
1. A 5-letter word with A in position 2
2. No R, I, S, E letters
3. We haven't learned anything about positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 yet

Good candidate letters to test next would include T, N, L, D, B, C, M, Y, etc. since these are common but haven't been ruled out.

Possible words that fit:
- BANAL
- CANAL
- MANLY
- TAMAL
- GAMAY
- PAPAL

I'll choose CANAL because:
- A is in position 2
- Uses C, N, L which are common and give new info
- Uses A in position 4 which tests if A appears twice (possible)
- Simple, common word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CANAL → C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)  
   – Second A is present but is not in position 4 (so it must be in 1, 3, or 5).  
   – C, N, L are not in the word.

Therefore we now know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _ (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 still open).  
- No letters: R, I, S, E, C, N, L.  
- The word contains at least one extra A somewhere (because the second A got “-”).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, B, G, M, P, Y, H, K, W, F, V, etc.  
We want a common word that has A in position 2 plus another A in 1, 3, or 5 and none of the banned letters.

Possible candidates:  
BAAED (uses A twice, but contains E which is banned) – invalid.  
TAJAS (contains J and S – bad).  
MACAW (has C) – bad.  
MAFIA (contains F and I) – bad.  
PAGAN (has N) – bad.  
HABAN (has N) – bad.  
BAHTA (has H, T) – H and T still allowed, only uses letters not yet excluded.  

Let’s check BAHTA:  
- Letters used: B, A, H, T, A.  
- None of R, I, S, E, C, N, L appear.  
- A is in position 2 and again in position 5 (satisfies the second A being present).  
- It’s a valid English word (variant spelling of a head scarf “bahta”).

So BAHTA looks safe.

Banned letters so far: R, I, S, E, C, N, L, B, H.

Candidate letters still allowed: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Word must be 5 letters, have A in 2 and T in 4, and contain exactly one more A in 1, 3, or 5.

Possible positions for the extra A:

- Position 3: _ A A T _  → e.g., DAATA (invalid).  
- Position 5: _ A _ T A  → e.g., GATJA (invalid).

Looking for real words, the only common English 5-letter word fitting _ A _ T A with the constraints is “GATJA” (which is obscure) and “DATTA” (also obscure). However, “DATTA” contains D and two T’s, but the word needs exactly one T. 

Next best is “FATAL” but L is banned.  
“PATMA” – M and P are allowed, but it’s not a standard word.  
“VATMA” – V and M, also not standard.  

After checking, “DATTA” is the closest valid option despite its rarity. It fits:
- D in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (fixed)  
- T in 3 (but we know T is in 4, conflict). 

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is _ A _ T _, so position 3 must be the extra A.  
Thus, the form is _ A A T _.  
The only English word fitting this is “CAATT” (invalid). 

Rechecking: we need _ A _ T _ with an extra A in 1, 3, or 5.

Therefore the pattern must be _ A T T _ with an additional A that must sit in position 1 or 5 (it cannot be anywhere else).

That gives two possible skeletons:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and different vowels/consonants to maximize the chance of hitting or eliminating letters. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we need:
1. A 5-letter word with A in position 2
2. No R, I, S, E letters
3. We haven't learned anything about positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 yet

Good candidate letters to test next would include T, N, L, D, B, C, M, Y, etc. since these are common but haven't been ruled out.

Possible words that fit:
- BANAL
- CANAL
- MANLY
- TAMAL
- GAMAY
- PAPAL

I'll choose CANAL because:
- A is in position 2
- Uses C, N, L which are common and give new info
- Uses A in position 4 which tests if A appears twice (possible)
- Simple, common word

<guess>CANAL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CANAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CANAL → C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)  
   – Second A is present but is not in position 4 (so it must be in 1, 3, or 5).  
   – C, N, L are not in the word.

Therefore we now know:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _ (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 still open).  
- No letters: R, I, S, E, C, N, L.  
- The word contains at least one extra A somewhere (because the second A got “-”).

Good remaining consonants: T, D, B, G, M, P, Y, H, K, W, F, V, etc.  
We want a common word that has A in position 2 plus another A in 1, 3, or 5 and none of the banned letters.

Possible candidates:  
BAAED (uses A twice, but contains E which is banned) – invalid.  
TAJAS (contains J and S – bad).  
MACAW (has C) – bad.  
MAFIA (contains F and I) – bad.  
PAGAN (has N) – bad.  
HABAN (has N) – bad.  
BAHTA (has H, T) – H and T still allowed, only uses letters not yet excluded.  

Let’s check BAHTA:  
- Letters used: B, A, H, T, A.  
- None of R, I, S, E, C, N, L appear.  
- A is in position 2 and again in position 5 (satisfies the second A being present).  
- It’s a valid English word (variant spelling of a head scarf “bahta”).

So BAHTA looks safe.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CANAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: BAHTA -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) H(x) T(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – R, I, S, E are absent.

2. CANAL → C(x) A(✓) N(x) A(-) L(x)  
   – Second A is present but not in position 4.  
   – C, N, L are absent.

3. BAHTA → B(x) A(✓) H(x) T(✓) A(-)  
   – T is in position 4 (✓).  
   – B and H are absent.  
   – The second A is present but not in position 5.

So the pattern now is:  
_ A _ T _  
and we still need one more A (because it was “-” in both CANAL and BAHTA) that must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
Banned letters so far: R, I, S, E, C, N, L, B, H.

Candidate letters still allowed: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Word must be 5 letters, have A in 2 and T in 4, and contain exactly one more A in 1, 3, or 5.

Possible positions for the extra A:
- Position 1: A A _ T _  → e.g., AARTY (invalid).  
- Position 3: _ A A T _  → e.g., DAATA (invalid).  
- Position 5: _ A _ T A  → e.g., GATJA (invalid).

Looking for real words, the only common English 5-letter word fitting _ A _ T A with the constraints is “GATJA” (which is obscure) and “DATTA” (also obscure). However, “DATTA” contains D and two T’s, but the word needs exactly one T. 

Next best is “FATAL” but L is banned.  
“PATMA” – M and P are allowed, but it’s not a standard word.  
“VATMA” – V and M, also not standard.  

After checking, “DATTA” is the closest valid option despite its rarity. It fits:
- D in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (fixed)  
- T in 3 (but we know T is in 4, conflict). 

Realizing the mistake: the pattern is _ A _ T _, so position 3 must be the extra A.  
Thus, the form is _ A A T _.  
The only English word fitting this is “CAATT” (invalid). 

Rechecking: we need _ A _ T _ with an extra A in 1, 3, or 5.  
Valid word: “KATTA” – fits _ A _ T A (A in 2 and 5, T in 4).  
Letters: K, A, T (allowed), none of the banned letters.  

“KATTA” is a valid word (a type of knife in South Asia).
