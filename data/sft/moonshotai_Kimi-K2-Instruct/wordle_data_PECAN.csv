For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"". 

""RAISE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It includes common vowels (A, I, E)
- It includes common consonants (R, S)
- These letters frequently appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good feedback about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R (first letter) → x → not in the word at all  
- A (second letter) → - → A is in the word, but not in the second position  
- I (third letter) → x → not in the word  
- S (fourth letter) → x → not in the word  
- E (fifth letter) → - → E is in the word, but not in the fifth position  

So the secret word:
- contains A and E (somewhere, position unknown)  
- does NOT contain R, I, or S  
- the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding R, I, S.

We still need to find three more letters. To maximize information, we should pick a word that introduces new common consonants and keeps the known letters A and E in different positions. A good choice is ""OCEAN"":

- O: new vowel (not yet tested)

- E: already known to be present; we’ll place it in position 3 to test new placement  
- A: already known to be present; we’ll place it in position 4 (different from position 2)

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters that ARE in the secret word:
- A – now known to be in position 4 (since it got ✓ in OCEAN’s 4th slot)
- E – still somewhere, but not in position 3
- C – in the word, but not in position 2
- N – in the word, but not in position 5

Known letters NOT in the word:
R, I, S, O (from first two guesses)

Unused letters so far that are common: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We have the pattern: _ _ _ A N, but we know N is not in position 5, so the word must end with A N? Wait, that would put N in position 5, which conflicts with feedback. Therefore the pattern is actually _ _ A _ N, and N is in position 5. The feedback must be interpreted as “N is in the word, but not in the position we tried (5)”? No—that’s impossible because the feedback in Guess 2 has N in position 5 marked ✓. So N is in position 5 for sure, and the feedback that N “is in the word but wrong position” applies to Guess 2 where N was in position 5 and received ✓, so that’s not a conflict.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ _ A N

Letters still to place: C and E.  Also need one more letter.

Positions 1, 2, 3 are open (position 3 has A, so positions 1,2,4 are open – wait let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Pattern:   _ _ _ A N

Letters we still need to place: C, E, plus one more letter from the remaining alphabet (excluding R,I,S,O).

Possible choices for the fifth letter: T, L, M, B, D, etc.

We also know:
- E is not in position 3 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2), so it could be 1, 2, or 4 – but 4 is A, so 1 or 2.
- C is not in position 2 (from Guess 2), so it could be 1, 3, 4 – but 3 is A, 4 is A, so C must be in 1 or 3 (but 3 is A), so C must be position 1.

So we have:
C _ _ A N, with E needing to go into position 2.

Thus the word is C E _ A N, but we need a 5-letter word. The third letter must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. Let’s try C E D A N – but “CEDAN” isn’t a word. How about C E T A N – “CETAN” isn’t valid. Next: C E L A N – no. C E B A N – no. C E V A N – no.

Wait, our pattern is wrong. Actually positions 1,2,3 are open; position 4 is A, position 5 is N. So we have _ _ _ A N, with letters C and E somewhere in 1,2,3 plus one more letter.

But we have only 5 letters total, and we already have A and N fixed in 4 and 5. That leaves 1,2,3 for C, E, and one more letter. But that would be 6 letters total (C,E,A,N, plus one more), which is impossible. So we must have misunderstood: the word contains C and E somewhere in 1-3, but we still need to choose 3 letters total. Actually, the word only has 5 letters, and we already know positions 4 and 5 are A and N.

So the word is _ _ _ A N, and must contain C and E in positions 1,2, or 3. That’s 3 slots for 3 letters (C, E, and one more). The third letter must be a new letter we haven’t used (from remaining alphabet). Let’s think of 5-letter words ending in A N that contain C and E.

Examples: CLEAN, OCEAN (but O is out), PE CAN (but S is out), etc. “CLEAN” is valid and fits:

C L E A N – let’s test if it fits all feedback:
- C: in word, not position 2 (from Guess 2) – in CLEAN, C is position 1 ✓
- E: in word, not position 3 or 5 – in CLEAN, E is position 3? Wait, in CLEAN, E is position 3, but from Guess 1 (RAISE) E was not in position 5 (which is irrelevant here) and from Guess 2 (OCEAN) E is not in position 3 (but in CLEAN, E is position 3). So CLEAN would be invalid because E would be in position 3, which is excluded.

Next candidate: D E C A N – but “DECAN” isn’t a common word. “OCEAN” is already used. Next: M E C A N – no. T E C A N – no. B E C A N – no. H E C A N – no.

Alternative: place C in position 3: _ _ C A N – but then C is in position 3, which is allowed (only position 2 was excluded). Then E must be in 1 or 2. Let’s try E C _ A N – but EC isn’t a start for common words. E B C A N – invalid.

Another approach: the third letter could be D, forming C E D A N – but that’s not a word. Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E somewhere:

Valid words: C E L A N (no), C H E A N (no), C A E N (no), C E A N (no), C A N E (no), C A N E is 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think systematically. The pattern is _ _ _ A N, and must include C and E. Possible words:

- C E L A N – invalid
- C E D A N – invalid
- C E B A N – invalid
- C E T A N – invalid
- E C _ A N – E C aren’t common starts
- _ E C A N – L E C A N – no
- _ C E A N – D C E A N – no

Wait, “DECAN” is a word (variant of “deacon”), but uncommon. “OCEAN” is used. “CLEAN” is the most plausible, but E is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next possibility: the third letter is T, forming C E T A N – no. 

This suggests the word isn’t C E _ A N. Let’s try where C is in position 1 and E is in position 2: C E _ A N. The third letter must form a valid word. The only common word is C E L A N – no. 

Alternative: word structure _ _ _ A N with C and E: another word is M E C A N – no, but “MECAN” isn’t valid. 

This indicates we might need to choose a different consonant. Let’s try “HEXAN” – but H hasn’t been tested yet. Actually, let’s reconsider: the word must contain C and E somewhere, and end with A N. So positions 1,2,3 must be C, E, and one other letter.

Valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E:
- CLEAN – but E is in position 3, which is excluded by Guess 2
- OCEAN – used
- DECAN – valid (variant spelling of deacon)
- B E C A N – no
- T E C A N – no

“DECAN” seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints:
- D: new letter
- E: in position 2 (allowed, not excluded)
- C: in position 3 (allowed, only position 2 excluded)
- A: position 4 ✓
- N: position 5 ✓

Let’s choose DECAN.

Another approach: the third letter could be D, forming C E D A N – but that’s not a word. Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E somewhere:

Valid words: C E L A N (no), C H E A N (no), C A E N (no), C E A N (no), C A N E (no), C A N E is 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think systematically. The pattern is _ _ _ A N, and must include C and E. Possible words:

- C E L A N – invalid
- C E D A N – invalid
- C E B A N – invalid
- C E T A N – invalid
- E C _ A N – E C aren’t common starts
- _ E C A N – L E C A N – no
- _ C E A N – D C E A N – no

Wait, “DECAN” is a word (variant of “deacon”), but uncommon. “OCEAN” is used. “CLEAN” is the most plausible, but E is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next possibility: the third letter is T, forming C E T A N – no. 

This suggests the word isn’t C E _ A N. Let’s try where C is in position 1 and E is in position 2: C E _ A N. The third letter must form a valid word. The only common word is C E L A N – no. 

Alternative: word structure _ _ _ A N with C and E: another word is M E C A N – no, but “MECAN” isn’t valid. 

This indicates we might need to choose a different consonant. Let’s try “HEXAN” – but H hasn’t been tested yet. Actually, let’s reconsider: the word must contain C and E somewhere, and end with A N. So positions 1,2,3 must be C, E, and one other letter.

Valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E:
- CLEAN – but E is in position 3, which is excluded by Guess 2
- OCEAN – used
- DECAN – valid (variant spelling of deacon)
- B E C A N – no
- T E C A N – no

“DECAN” seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints:
- D: new letter
- E: in position 2 (allowed, not excluded)
- C: in position 3 (allowed, only position 2 excluded)
- A: position 4 ✓
- N: position 5 ✓

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PECAN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"". 

""RAISE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It includes common vowels (A, I, E)
- It includes common consonants (R, S)
- These letters frequently appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good feedback about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R (first letter) → x → not in the word at all  
- A (second letter) → - → A is in the word, but not in the second position  
- I (third letter) → x → not in the word  
- S (fourth letter) → x → not in the word  
- E (fifth letter) → - → E is in the word, but not in the fifth position  

So the secret word:
- contains A and E (somewhere, position unknown)  
- does NOT contain R, I, or S  
- the remaining letters must come from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding R, I, S.

We still need to find three more letters. To maximize information, we should pick a word that introduces new common consonants and keeps the known letters A and E in different positions. A good choice is ""OCEAN"":

- O: new vowel (not yet tested)  
- C: common consonant (not yet tested)  
- E: already known to be present; we’ll place it in position 3 to test new placement  
- A: already known to be present; we’ll place it in position 4 (different from position 2)  
- N: common consonant (not yet tested)

This tests five new letters (O, C, E, A, N) while reusing A and E in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.

<guess>OCEAN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) C(-) E(-) A(✓) N(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters that ARE in the secret word:
- A – now known to be in position 4 (since it got ✓ in OCEAN’s 4th slot)
- E – still somewhere, but not in position 3
- C – in the word, but not in position 2
- N – in the word, but not in position 5

Known letters NOT in the word:
R, I, S, O (from first two guesses)

Unused letters so far that are common: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We have the pattern: _ _ _ A N, but we know N is not in position 5, so the word must end with A N? Wait, that would put N in position 5, which conflicts with feedback. Therefore the pattern is actually _ _ A _ N, and N is in position 5. The feedback must be interpreted as “N is in the word, but not in the position we tried (5)”? No—that’s impossible because the feedback in Guess 2 has N in position 5 marked ✓. So N is in position 5 for sure, and the feedback that N “is in the word but wrong position” applies to Guess 2 where N was in position 5 and received ✓, so that’s not a conflict.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ _ A N

Letters still to place: C and E.  Also need one more letter.

Positions 1, 2, 3 are open (position 3 has A, so positions 1,2,4 are open – wait let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Pattern:   _ _ _ A N

Letters we still need to place: C, E, plus one more letter from the remaining alphabet (excluding R,I,S,O).

Possible choices for the fifth letter: T, L, M, B, D, etc.

We also know:
- E is not in position 3 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2), so it could be 1, 2, or 4 – but 4 is A, so 1 or 2.
- C is not in position 2 (from Guess 2), so it could be 1, 3, 4 – but 3 is A, 4 is A, so C must be in 1 or 3 (but 3 is A), so C must be position 1.

So we have:
C _ _ A N, with E needing to go into position 2.

Thus the word is C E _ A N, but we need a 5-letter word. The third letter must be a consonant we haven’t used yet. Let’s try C E D A N – but “CEDAN” isn’t a word. How about C E T A N – “CETAN” isn’t valid. Next: C E L A N – no. C E B A N – no. C E V A N – no.

Wait, our pattern is wrong. Actually positions 1,2,3 are open; position 4 is A, position 5 is N. So we have _ _ _ A N, with letters C and E somewhere in 1,2,3 plus one more letter.

But we have only 5 letters total, and we already have A and N fixed in 4 and 5. That leaves 1,2,3 for C, E, and one more letter. But that would be 6 letters total (C,E,A,N, plus one more), which is impossible. So we must have misunderstood: the word contains C and E somewhere in 1-3, but we still need to choose 3 letters total. Actually, the word only has 5 letters, and we already know positions 4 and 5 are A and N.

So the word is _ _ _ A N, and must contain C and E in positions 1,2, or 3. That’s 3 slots for 3 letters (C, E, and one more). The third letter must be a new letter we haven’t used (from remaining alphabet). Let’s think of 5-letter words ending in A N that contain C and E.

Examples: CLEAN, OCEAN (but O is out), PE CAN (but S is out), etc. “CLEAN” is valid and fits:

C L E A N – let’s test if it fits all feedback:
- C: in word, not position 2 (from Guess 2) – in CLEAN, C is position 1 ✓
- E: in word, not position 3 or 5 – in CLEAN, E is position 3? Wait, in CLEAN, E is position 3, but from Guess 1 (RAISE) E was not in position 5 (which is irrelevant here) and from Guess 2 (OCEAN) E is not in position 3 (but in CLEAN, E is position 3). So CLEAN would be invalid because E would be in position 3, which is excluded.

Next candidate: D E C A N – but “DECAN” isn’t a common word. “OCEAN” is already used. Next: M E C A N – no. T E C A N – no. B E C A N – no. H E C A N – no.

Alternative: place C in position 3: _ _ C A N – but then C is in position 3, which is allowed (only position 2 was excluded). Then E must be in 1 or 2. Let’s try E C _ A N – but EC isn’t a start for common words. E B C A N – invalid.

Another approach: the third letter could be D, forming C E D A N – but that’s not a word. Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E somewhere:

Valid words: C E L A N (no), C H E A N (no), C A E N (no), C E A N (no), C A N E (no), C A N E is 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think systematically. The pattern is _ _ _ A N, and must include C and E. Possible words:

- C E L A N – invalid
- C E D A N – invalid
- C E B A N – invalid
- C E T A N – invalid
- E C _ A N – E C aren’t common starts
- _ E C A N – L E C A N – no
- _ C E A N – D C E A N – no

Wait, “DECAN” is a word (variant of “deacon”), but uncommon. “OCEAN” is used. “CLEAN” is the most plausible, but E is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next possibility: the third letter is T, forming C E T A N – no. 

This suggests the word isn’t C E _ A N. Let’s try where C is in position 1 and E is in position 2: C E _ A N. The third letter must form a valid word. The only common word is C E L A N – no. 

Alternative: word structure _ _ _ A N with C and E: another word is M E C A N – no, but “MECAN” isn’t valid. 

This indicates we might need to choose a different consonant. Let’s try “HEXAN” – but H hasn’t been tested yet. Actually, let’s reconsider: the word must contain C and E somewhere, and end with A N. So positions 1,2,3 must be C, E, and one other letter.

Valid 5-letter words ending A N with C and E:

- OCEAN – used
- DECAN – valid (variant spelling of deacon)
- B E C A N – no
- T E C A N – no

“DECAN” seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints:
- D: new letter
- E: in position 2 (allowed, not excluded)
- C: in position 3 (allowed, only position 2 excluded)
- A: position 4 ✓
- N: position 5 ✓
