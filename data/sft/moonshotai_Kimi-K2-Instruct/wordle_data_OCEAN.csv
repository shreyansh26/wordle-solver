For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. A classic strategy is to use words like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" which contain common letters. 

Let me go with ""SLATE"" as it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good information about several common letters in the English language.

We now know:

- Must include the letters A, C, E.
- These letters are NOT in their positions from any of the previous guesses:

  A: not in position 3 (from SLATE), not in position 2 (from PEACH), not in position 2 (from CARVE).  
  So A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

  C: not in position 4 (from PEACH) and not in position 1 (from CARVE).  
  So C can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

  E: not in position 5 (from SLATE), not in position 2 (from PEACH), not in position 5 (from CARVE).  
  So E can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, T, P, H, R, V.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
  – Contains A, C, E exactly once each.
  – Contains two other distinct letters, neither of which have been eliminated.
  – Satisfies the positional constraints above.

Let’s list the remaining common consonants not yet eliminated: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z.  
We should pick two consonants from this set that are common and haven’t been used.

A possible candidate is “DANCE”:
- D and N are new consonants.
- Letters: D, A, N, C, E → all allowed.
- Check positions:
  – A in position 2 → disallowed (from PEACH).
  
So “DANCE” is invalid.

Next, “CAGED”:
- C, A, G, E, D.
- Check positions:
  – C in position 1 → disallowed (from CARVE).
  – A in position 2 → disallowed (from PEACH).
  – E in position 4 → allowed.
  – So invalid.

Next, “DECAF”:
- D, E, C, A, F.
- Check positions:
  – E in position 2 → disallowed (from PEACH).
  
Invalid.

Next, “BEACH” – H is eliminated.

Next, “CACHE” – H is eliminated and C is repeated.

Next, “CAMEO”:
- C, A, M, E, O.
- Check positions:
  – C in position 1 → disallowed (from CARVE).
  – A in position 2 → disallowed.
  – E in position 4 → allowed.
  
Invalid.

Next, “FACED”:
- F, A, C, E, D.
- Check positions:
  – A in position 2 → disallowed (from PEACH).
  
Invalid.

Next, “CABER” – R is eliminated.

Next, “CADET” – T is eliminated.

Next, “CANOE”:
- C, A, N, O, E.
- Check positions:
  – C in position 1 → disallowed (from CARVE).
  – A in position 2 → disallowed.
  – E in position 5 → disallowed (from SLATE).
  
Invalid.

Next, “OCEAN”:
- O, C, E, A, N.
- Check positions:
  – O: new, allowed.
  – C in position 2 → allowed.
  – E in position 3 → allowed.
  – A in position 4 → allowed.
  – N in position 5 → allowed.

All constraints satisfied:
- Contains A, C, E.
- Letters O and N are new and not eliminated.
- Positions:
  – A is in position 4 → allowed.
  – C is in position 2 → allowed.
  – E is in position 3 → allowed.

So “OCEAN” is a valid candidate.
