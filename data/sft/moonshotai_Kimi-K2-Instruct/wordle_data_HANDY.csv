Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants

Common starting words in Wordle include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word and getting useful feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are **not in the word** (x).
- A is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-) – i.e., A is present but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A.
- Does **not** contain S, L, T, E.
- We still have no information about B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

My next guess should:
1. Include the confirmed letter A (but in a different position than 3rd).
2. Use other common letters **not** yet ruled out.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.

A good choice is ""RADIO"" because:
- Has A (now in position 2).
- Uses R, D, I, O – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- Does not reuse any ruled-out letters.

Alternative options could be ""MARCH"", ""BREAD"", or ""FRANK"", but ""RADIO"" gives a nice mix of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, D) while keeping A in a new position.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants

Common starting words in Wordle include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word and getting useful feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are **not in the word** (x).
- A is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-) – i.e., A is present but not in the 3rd position.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A.
- Does **not** contain S, L, T, E.
- We still have no information about B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

My next guess should:
1. Include the confirmed letter A (but in a different position than 3rd).
2. Use other common letters **not** yet ruled out.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.

A good choice is ""RADIO"" because:
- Has A (now in position 2).
- Uses R, D, I, O – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- Does not reuse any ruled-out letters.

Alternative options could be ""MARCH"", ""BREAD"", or ""FRANK"", but ""RADIO"" gives a nice mix of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, D) while keeping A in a new position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From SLATE:  
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. From RADIO:  
   - R is NOT in the word.  
   - I and O are NOT in the word.  
   - A is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).  
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (i.e., it must appear somewhere else).

3. So far we know:  
   - The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A fixed in position 2).  
   - The word **must** contain the letter D somewhere **other than position 3**.  
   - The word must **not** contain S, L, T, E, R, I, O.  
   - Remaining available letters (consonants and vowels not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the D we know is present.

4. We need a 5-letter word with:  
   - A in position 2.  
   - D somewhere except position 3.  
   - All other letters from the available pool.

5. A straightforward candidate is BANDY:  
   - B, N, Y are still allowed.  
   - A is in the correct spot.  
   - D is in position 4 (allowed).  
   - Uses no banned letters.

Another candidate could be CADDY, but that repeats D in positions 3 and 4, and position 3 is disallowed for D.  
MADLY is also viable but has L, which is already banned.  
HANDY is good except H is less common.  
BANDY seems cleanest.
