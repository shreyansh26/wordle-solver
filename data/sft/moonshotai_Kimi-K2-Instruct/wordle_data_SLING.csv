For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This should help identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is correct in position 2
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is S L _ _ _.  
The letters we must use: S, L (already placed).  
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, T, E.

To fill the last three slots we’ll look for common 5-letter words that start with “SL” and avoid A/T/E.  
Common endings for SL- words include “ICK” (SLICK), “OW” (SLOW—but O and W are still possible), “IME” (SLIME—but E is excluded), etc. The only immediately valid and common 5-letter word that fits S L _ _ _ and avoids A/T/E is:

Current known facts:
- Pattern is S L I _ _ (positions 1-3 locked in).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, C, K.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form SLI?? that avoids A, T, E, C, K.  
Available letters (excluding the five forbidden ones) include: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Common endings for SLI- words:
- SLING  
- SLIME (but E is forbidden)  
- SLIPS  
- SLITS (but T is forbidden)  
- SLIVE (rare)  
- SLING is a valid word and uses none of the forbidden letters.
