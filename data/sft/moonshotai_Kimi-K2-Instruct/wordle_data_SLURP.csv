For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained. The word should help me identify which vowels are present and rule out or confirm several consonants. A commonly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers 3 vowels and 2 consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better as it includes S (very common initial consonant), L, A, T, and E - giving good coverage. This should provide helpful feedback about several key letters right away.

From the feedback on SLATE:
1. S is in the correct first position.
2. L is in the correct second position.
3. A, T, and E are not in the word.

So the word looks like: S L _ _ _ with no A, T, or E.

Now I need to pick three more letters (positions 3, 4, 5) avoiding A, T, E and using common remaining consonants/vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U and common consonants to try include R, N, D, C, P, M, etc.

I'm looking for a word that fits S L _ _ _ and uses new letters to test. Some possibilities:
- SLING (S L I N G) - uses I, N, G
- SLOSH (S L O S H) - but has duplicate S which might be less efficient
- SLUMP (S L U M P) - uses U, M, P
- SLICK (S L I C K) - uses I, C, K

""SLICK"" seems good as it introduces I, C, K which are common and haven't been tested yet, while keeping the confirmed S and L positions.

So the word must be S L _ _ _ and the remaining letters to use must come from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three more letters for positions 3-5. Let's look for common consonants and vowels that haven't been ruled out. The remaining vowels are O and U.

Good candidates for the next guess would test new high-frequency letters like R, N, M, D, G, while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Latest feedback tells us:
- Positions 1-2-3-5: S L U _ P and all are correct.
- M at position 4 is wrong, so the missing letter must be something else that hasn’t been ruled out.

Letters already eliminated: A, T, E, I, C, K, M.

Thus, the word is SLU _ P where the blank must be a letter from
{ B, D, F, G, H, J, N, O, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z }.

Among those, the most common consonants are R, N, D, G, B.

Candidate words:
- SLURP  → uses R (still allowed)
- SLUND → invalid (not a word)
- SLUBP → invalid
- SLUGP → invalid
- SLUDP → invalid

Only SLURP is a valid English word that fits the pattern SLU _ P and uses a still-allowed letter.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SLURP.
