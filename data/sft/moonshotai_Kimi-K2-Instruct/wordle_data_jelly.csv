Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback to work with, we should choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters, especially vowels.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E), including 3 vowels and 2 consonants. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE we now know:
- A, R, I, S are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the final position (the 5th position).

So we must avoid A, R, I, S entirely. We also know the word contains E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next candidates should:
1. Use none of A, R, I, S.
2. Contain E but not in the 5th spot.
3. Use other common letters to maximize learning.

With those constraints I can look for 5-letter words that fit. Limiting ourselves to high-frequency remaining letters (T, N, L, U, O, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q) and ensuring E appears.

Some possibilities:
- OCEAN (but A is forbidden)
- TENET (uses T, E – but T could be repeated, and we want to avoid repeats early)
- CLEFT (uses C, L, E, F, T – no forbidden letters, E in 3rd spot)
- GLOVE (but V is low frequency)
- OUGHT (but no E)

CLEFT looks good: C, L, E, F, T – none of A, R, I, S, and E is in the 3rd position.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters, especially vowels.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E), including 3 vowels and 2 consonants. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE we now know:
- A, R, I, S are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the final position (the 5th position).

So we must avoid A, R, I, S entirely. We also know the word contains E somewhere other than position 5.

Good next candidates should:
1. Use none of A, R, I, S.
2. Contain E but not in the 5th spot.
3. Use other common letters to maximize learning.

With those constraints I can look for 5-letter words that fit. Limiting ourselves to high-frequency remaining letters (T, N, L, U, O, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q) and ensuring E appears.

Some possibilities:
- OCEAN (but A is forbidden)
- TENET (uses T, E – but T could be repeated, and we want to avoid repeats early)
- CLEFT (uses C, L, E, F, T – no forbidden letters, E in 3rd spot)
- GLOVE (but V is low frequency)
- OUGHT (but no E)

CLEFT looks good: C, L, E, F, T – none of A, R, I, S, and E is in the 3rd position.

2. Letters already eliminated once and for all:
   A, R, I, S, C, F, T, M, O, N, K, P

3. Letters still usable (and not yet tested):
   B, D, G, H, U, W, (plus lower-frequency ones like V, X, Z, J, Q which are unlikely).

4. We need a valid English word that fits:
   - Length 5.
   - Pattern: ? E L ? Y
   - Uses only the allowed letters.

Scanning the pattern:

- B, D, G, H, U, W are all legal for the first and fourth positions.

Common English words matching _ E L _ Y:
   B E L L Y – but we already know L is in position 3, so double L is impossible (would need L in position 4, already ruled out by previous feedback).
   D E L V Y – not a word.
   G E L D Y – not a word.
   H E L V Y – not a word.
   W E L B Y – not a word.
   H E L L Y – same double-L issue.

The only real candidate left that exactly matches _ E L _ Y and uses remaining unused letters is:

   H E L V Y – but “HELVE” (the handle of an axe) is a valid word, and adding a Y to make “HELVEY” is not valid.

Wait, let’s double-check carefully:

Dictionary check:
- “DELAY” – A is forbidden.
- “BELLY” – already ruled out (double L).
- “JELLY” – J is untested but “JELLY” is common and fits _ E L _ Y; J has never been marked X or ✓ yet, so it’s allowed.

Let’s confirm:
- J has never appeared in any previous guess, so it’s still in play.
- E, L, Y are already confirmed in their correct places.
- JELLY uses only allowed letters and gives us a test of J, which is new.

Therefore:

<guess>JELLY</guess>
</think>

<guess>JELLY</guess>",JELLY,"Summary of everything we know so far:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2 = E (✓)
   - Position 3 = L (✓)
   - Position 5 = Y (✓)
