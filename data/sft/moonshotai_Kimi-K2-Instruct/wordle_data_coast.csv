For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter coverage to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used letters in English and cover different vowels and consonants. 

Popular effective starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- TABLE (T, A, B, L, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage and provide useful feedback about which of these common letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently third, so it must appear somewhere else).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Letters we now know:
- Fixed: C _ _ _ _
- Contains: A (but not in position 3)
- Excludes: R, N, E

Good second guesses should keep C fixed, use the A in a different spot, and introduce new common letters. Possible patterns:
C _ A _ _  
C _ _ A _  
C _ _ _ A  

Common letters left to try: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, W, Y, V, X, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to more frequent ones).

Let’s pick a word that fits:
- C _ A _ _: CLASS (but double S might be less informative), CLAPS, CRASH (but R excluded), CHAMP (H, M, P new), CHALK (H, L, K new)
- C _ _ A _: CLASH, CHARM (R excluded), COBRA (R excluded), COAST
- C _ _ _ A: CHINA (N excluded), COBIA, COBRA (R excluded), COULA, CUBA (too short)

- A (must move from 3 to 2 or 4 or 5; placed at 3 here, but we’ll see)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. C is fixed in position 1.
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since it was “-” in CAULK when it appeared in position 2).
3. Letters definitely not in the word: R, N, E, U, L, K.

So the pattern we must satisfy is:
C _ _ _ _ 
with
- A somewhere in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- The remaining three letters must come from the unused common letters left: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, H, F, I, O, W, Y, V, X, Z, Q, J.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
- keeps C in position 1,
- places A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, or 5),
- introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words checking each A-position:

A in position 3:
C _ A _ _
   – CHASM (H, S, M new)  (H now allowed)
   – COAST (O, S, T new)  (O new)
   – CRAWL (R excluded)
   – CLASP (L excluded)
   → CHASM or COAST look good.

A in position 4:
C _ _ A _
   – COPRA (R excluded)
   – COBRA (R excluded)
   – COSTA (S, T, O new)
   – COBIA (B, I, O new)
   → COSTA, COBIA, COMMA (M repeated) – COSTA seems best.

A in position 5:
C _ _ _ A
   – COBIA (already covered)
   – COBRA (R excluded)
   – COMAA (invalid)
   – COBIA (already)
   – COBRA (invalid)

So the strongest choices are:
- CHASM (A at 3, introduces H, S, M)
- COAST (A at 3, introduces O, S, T)
- COSTA (A at 4, introduces O, S, T)

All are solid, but CHASM gives us H and M which are less common and thus high-information. However, let’s pick COAST because O, S, T are very frequent and we haven’t tested them yet.

So: C O A S T (COAST)

<guess>COAST</guess>",COAST,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. C is fixed in position 1.
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since it was “-” in CAULK when it appeared in position 2).
3. Letters definitely not in the word: R, N, E, U, L, K.

So the pattern we must satisfy is:
C _ _ _ _ 
with
- A somewhere in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- The remaining three letters must come from the unused common letters left: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, H, F, I, O, W, Y, V, X, Z, Q, J.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
- keeps C in position 1,
- places A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, or 5),
- introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words checking each A-position:

A in position 3:
C _ A _ _
   – CHASM (H, S, M new)  (H now allowed)
   – COAST (O, S, T new)  (O new)
   – CRAWL (R excluded)
   – CLASP (L excluded)
   → CHASM or COAST look good.

A in position 4:
C _ _ A _
   – COPRA (R excluded)
   – COBRA (R excluded)
   – COSTA (S, T, O new)
   – COBIA (B, I, O new)
   → COSTA, COBIA, COMMA (M repeated) – COSTA seems best.

A in position 5:
C _ _ _ A
   – COBIA (already covered)
   – COBRA (R excluded)
   – COMAA (invalid)
   – COBIA (already)
   – COBRA (invalid)

So the strongest choices are:
- CHASM (A at 3, introduces H, S, M)
- COAST (A at 3, introduces O, S, T)
- COSTA (A at 4, introduces O, S, T)

All are solid, but CHASM gives us H and M which are less common and thus high-information. However, let’s pick COAST because O, S, T are very frequent and we haven’t tested them yet.

So: C O A S T (COAST)",Guess 3: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
