Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters frequently found in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize information gain for subsequent guesses. Common high-frequency consonants include T, N, S, R, L, and common vowels are E, A, I, O, U.

A good starting word should balance these letters. ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (common consonant, often at start or end)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong information baseline across multiple potential letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are absent from the word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A (and not in position 3).
- Excludes S, L, T, E entirely.

Let’s pick a word with a fresh set of common letters that avoids the banned ones (S,L,T,E) and includes A.  
A good choice is “RADIO”:
- R: common consonant (not yet tested)
- A: known to be in the word
- D: common consonant (not yet tested)
- I: common vowel (not yet tested)
- O: common vowel (not yet tested)
Additionally, A is placed in position 2 (avoiding the forbidden position 3), which helps confirm its correct placement or relocation.

After three guesses we have:

1. Fixed letters (✓):
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 1: H
   - Position 5: Y

2. Eliminated letters (x):  
   S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, N, K

So the word pattern is: H A _ _ Y

Letters still allowed (have never appeared):  
B, C, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Z (plus A, H, Y already placed)

We need two more letters in positions 3 and 4, chosen only from the still-allowed set while forming a valid English word.

Candidate combinations for positions 3-4:
- B & U → HABUY (not a word)
- C & U → HACUY (not a word)
- G & U → HAGUY (not a word)
- M & B → HAMBY (not common)
- P & P → HAPPY (valid word!)
- C & K → HACKY (but K eliminated)
- G & G → HAGGY (valid but G doubled)
- B & B → HABBY (not a word)

The only common, valid 5-letter English word that fits is HAPPY.
