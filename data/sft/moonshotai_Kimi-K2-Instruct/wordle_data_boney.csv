For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and can help identify which letters are in the word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A – all absent (x)
- N and E – present but not in their guessed spots ( - )

So the word:
- definitely contains N and E
- does NOT contain C, R, or A
- is still 5 letters long

Since N and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, we need to try other placements. A reasonable next guess is “STONE”.

- It reuses E and N in new positions (E in 5, N in 4 → swap them).
- Introduces S, T, O – letters not yet ruled out.

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T
2. Letters IN the word: N, E, O
3. All three of N, E, O are in the word but none of them is in the position in which they were guessed so far:
   - N cannot be 4th
   - E cannot be 5th
   - O cannot be 3rd

We still have to find the remaining two letters from the unused alphabet.  Good letters that remain unused and are fairly common: D, L, I, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place N, E, O into new positions and fill the other two slots with common consonants.

Option: put O in 1st, E in 2nd, and N in 3rd or 5th, e.g. O P E N D (but that uses D and P).  
I’ll pick “OPENS” – it uses O, P, E, N, S.  Wait, S is already ruled out, so that’s bad.

Try “OLIVE”: O, L, I, V, E – has O and E, but N is missing.

Try “MONET”: M, O, N, E, T – but T is ruled out.

Try “OLMEN”: uses O, L, M, E, N – all letters ok so far (no C, R, A, S, T).  Positions:
- O in 1st
- L in 2nd
- M in 3rd
- E in 4th (allowed since E cannot be 5th)
- N in 5th (allowed since N cannot be 4th)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and can help identify which letters are in the word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A – all absent (x)
- N and E – present but not in their guessed spots ( - )

So the word:
- definitely contains N and E
- does NOT contain C, R, or A
- is still 5 letters long

Since N and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, we need to try other placements. A reasonable next guess is “STONE”.

- It reuses E and N in new positions (E in 5, N in 4 → swap them).
- Introduces S, T, O – letters not yet ruled out.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T
2. Letters IN the word: N, E, O
3. All three of N, E, O are in the word but none of them is in the position in which they were guessed so far:
   - N cannot be 4th
   - E cannot be 5th
   - O cannot be 3rd

We still have to find the remaining two letters from the unused alphabet.  Good letters that remain unused and are fairly common: D, L, I, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place N, E, O into new positions and fill the other two slots with common consonants.

Option: put O in 1st, E in 2nd, and N in 3rd or 5th, e.g. O P E N D (but that uses D and P).  
I’ll pick “OPENS” – it uses O, P, E, N, S.  Wait, S is already ruled out, so that’s bad.

Try “OLIVE”: O, L, I, V, E – has O and E, but N is missing.

Try “MONET”: M, O, N, E, T – but T is ruled out.

Try “OLMEN”: uses O, L, M, E, N – all letters ok so far (no C, R, A, S, T).  Positions:
- O in 1st
- L in 2nd
- M in 3rd
- E in 4th (allowed since E cannot be 5th)
- N in 5th (allowed since N cannot be 4th)

So “OLMEN” satisfies all constraints.
