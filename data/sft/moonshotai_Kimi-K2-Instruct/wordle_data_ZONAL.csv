For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. Ideally, it should:
1. Contain common letters to help identify which letters are in the word.
2. Avoid repeating letters so we can test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a valid word that can reveal patterns in consonant and vowel positions.

Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help quickly narrow down the word structure. It also avoids repeating letters.

- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. Letters in the word, with exact positions: _ O N A _ (positions 2, 3, 4).
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E, G, D.
3. Positions already filled: 2, 3, 4 → we still need letters for positions 1 and 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has structure: ? O N A ?
- Does not contain R, S, E, G, D.
- Uses only remaining unused letters for positions 1 and 5.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z.
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already placed).

Possible endings for 5th letter: consonants or vowels except already used.
Let’s think of common words that fit _ O N A _:
- BONAF (not a word)
- MONAL (as in Mona Lisa, but MONAL is not a valid word)
- CONAL (archaic, not common)
- FONAL (not a word)
- TONAL (valid word, meaning relating to tone)

Check TONAL:
- T in 1st, O in 2nd, N in 3rd, A in 4th, L in 5th.
- Does not use any forbidden letters: R, S, E, G, D.
- All letters are valid and untested (except O, N, A which are confirmed).

Thus, ""TONAL"" fits perfectly. Let’s go with this.

From the feedback on TONAL:
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is correct (position 2).
- N(✓) → N is correct (position 3).
- A(✓) → A is correct (position 4).
- L(✓) → L is correct (position 5).

So the secret word is now fully known except for the first letter:
_ O N A L

Letters already ruled out from previous guesses:
- R, S, E, G, D, T
- Plus any others that appeared and were marked “x”.

We need a single letter for position 1 that
- has not been tried,
- forms a valid 5-letter English word with O N A L,
- and has not been marked “x”.

List of consonants not yet excluded:
B, C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z

Possible words:
BONAL – not valid
CONAL – valid (though archaic, listed in dictionaries)
FONAL – not valid
HONAL – not valid
KONAL – not found
MONAL – not standard
PONAL – not found
VONAL – not found
WONAL – not found
YONAL – not found
ZONAL – valid (forming zones)

Between CONAL and ZONAL, “ZONAL” is the common, dictionary-valid word.

Therefore, the only practical remaining candidate is ZONAL.
