Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and gives good information. The best first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback on the first try.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Letters we know are in the word: R and S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E  

We still need a 5-letter word without A, O, or E that contains both R and S, neither in their former positions (R not 2nd, S not 4th).  

Let’s pick a word that satisfies those constraints and uses several other common letters.  
“FIRST” is a good candidate:
- F, I, R, S, T  
- Contains both required letters R and S  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- S is in position 4 (forbidden by the feedback: we learned S is NOT in position 4) – so “FIRST” is invalid.  

Try “RISKY”:
- R is in position 1 – allowed  
- S is in position 3 – allowed  
- Contains no A, O, or E – good  
- Uses Y to test another common letter.

So “RISKY” fits all constraints.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Letters that MUST appear: R, S, I  
(They were all marked “-” in at least one guess, meaning present but not in that exact spot.)

Letters that CANNOT appear: A, O, E, K, Y, D, P  
(They received “x” somewhere.)

Positions that are still possible for each of the required letters:

R  
- Eliminated from positions 1 (RISKY), 2 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 3, 4, 5

S  
- Eliminated from positions 3 (RISKY), 4 (AROSE), 5 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 1, 2

I  
- Eliminated from positions 2 (RISKY), 3 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 1, 4, 5

We also know the word must use only remaining legal letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus R, S, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, S, I exactly once each  
- R not in 1 or 2, S only in 1 or 2, I only in 1, 4 or 5  
- Only uses legal letters

Quick check of constraints:
- If S is in 1, then I can be 4 or 5 and R can be 3,4,5 (but must be distinct)  
- If S is in 2, then I can be 1,4,5 and R can be 3,4,5

Let me try SIR (but that’s only 3 letters) – need 5.  
Try SIR plus two more legal letters in legal positions.

A word that fits: SIR with two more letters; the simplest is to put them at the end.

Consider SIR plus two more letters that are legal:

- S I R _ _  → R would be in position 3 ✓  
  Need two more letters, not repeating, legal.  
  Let’s try SIR + N + T → SIRNT (not a real word)

Try the reverse: put S in 2, I in 1, R in 4.

Need a third letter that is legal and fits.  
I S T R _ – IS T R _ → try IS TR_ → ISTR_  
ISTRA is not valid.

Try S I R _ _ again but use real 5-letter words:

SIR is the base; perhaps S I R V E – but E is forbidden.

Try F R I S … but FRISK has K (forbidden).

Try C R I S … CRISP is P forbidden.

Try S C R I _ → SCRIB, SCRIM, SCRIP – SCRIP has P forbidden.

Try S H I R _ → SHIRT – but T is allowed.

Check SHIRT:
Letters: S, H, I, R, T – all allowed  
Positions:
- S in 1 – allowed  
- H in 2 – legal  
- I in 3 – but I was eliminated from 3 (DRIPS showed I(-) in position 3) → so I is in the word but NOT in 3.  
  Thus SHIRT has I in 3 – invalid.

Try S T I R _ → STIR _ – STIRP has P (invalid).

Try S H R I _ → SHRI_ – SHRIM (invalid).

Try S C R I _ → SCRIM – again I in 4, but CRISP already ruled P out and I in 3.

Let me list valid English 5-letter words with exactly R, S, I and no forbidden letters.

Let me systematically try S in 1, I in 4, R in 3: S _ R I _  
S C R I B – CRIB is 4 letters.

Actually a valid candidate: CRISP is invalid (P), but maybe CRIS_ is not.

Let me try building it differently:  
R must be 3,4,5. S must be 1,2. I must be 1,4,5.

Try S in 1, I in 4, R in 3: S _ R I _  
S T R I C – STRIC not a word.

S C R I B – SCRIB not a real word.

S C R I M – SCRIM is a word.

Check SCRIM:
Letters: S, C, R, I, M – all allowed  
Positions:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,SPRIG,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and gives good information. The best first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback on the first try.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Letters we know are in the word: R and S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E  

We still need a 5-letter word without A, O, or E that contains both R and S, neither in their former positions (R not 2nd, S not 4th).  

Let’s pick a word that satisfies those constraints and uses several other common letters.  
“FIRST” is a good candidate:
- F, I, R, S, T  
- Contains both required letters R and S  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- S is in position 4 (forbidden by the feedback: we learned S is NOT in position 4) – so “FIRST” is invalid.  

Try “RISKY”:
- R is in position 1 – allowed  
- S is in position 3 – allowed  
- Contains no A, O, or E – good  
- Uses Y to test another common letter.

So “RISKY” fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RISKY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) S(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, I  (R and S from guess 1, I from guess 2)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, E, K, Y
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – R cannot be in position 1 (guess 2 showed R(-) in position 1)
  – S cannot be in position 3 (guess 2 showed S(-) in position 3)
  – S is also already known not to be in position 4 (from guess 1)

So R must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are eliminated)
I can be anywhere, but must be present.

Let’s build a word with R, S, I and no forbidden letters (A, O, E, K, Y).

I’ll try CRISP:
- C, R, I, S, P
- All letters allowed
- R is in position 2 – allowed
- S is in position 4 – forbidden (S was already ruled out of position 4 by guess 1). So no good.

Try FRISS – but that has a double S and uses S twice; we don’t know if the word allows double letters, and we also need to avoid doubles here for maximum info.

Try SPIRE:
- S, P, I, R, E – but E is forbidden.

Try DRIPS:
- D, R, I, P, S
- Contains R, I, S, no forbidden letters
- R is in position 2 – allowed
- S is in position 5 – allowed
- Other positions unrestricted by previous feedback

DRIPS satisfies all constraints.

So we now know:

- The word starts with S, has R in the 3rd position, and I in the 4th position: S _ R I _
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, E, K, Y, D, P, C, M
- Still allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, plus the known fixed letters S, R, I.

We now need to find a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ R I _ using the remaining allowed letters. The second letter can be any of B, F, G, H, J, L, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, and the fifth letter can be any of the same set, but must form a real word.

- S T R I N – “STIRN” is valid (archaic word for “stern” or “forehead”).
- S T R I G – “STRIG” is valid (a type of owl or to strip).

Between the two, “STIRN” is more commonly accepted in modern dictionaries as an archaic variant.

Therefore, the most likely candidate is “STIRN”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SPRIG,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and gives good information. The best first guesses typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize information

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback on the first try.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Letters we know are in the word: R and S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, E  

We still need a 5-letter word without A, O, or E that contains both R and S, neither in their former positions (R not 2nd, S not 4th).  

Let’s pick a word that satisfies those constraints and uses several other common letters.  
“FIRST” is a good candidate:
- F, I, R, S, T  
- Contains both required letters R and S  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- S is in position 4 (forbidden by the feedback: we learned S is NOT in position 4) – so “FIRST” is invalid.  

Try “RISKY”:
- R is in position 1 – allowed  
- S is in position 3 – allowed  
- Contains no A, O, or E – good  
- Uses Y to test another common letter.

So “RISKY” fits all constraints.

<guess>RISKY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RISKY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) S(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: R, S, I  (R and S from guess 1, I from guess 2)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, E, K, Y
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – R cannot be in position 1 (guess 2 showed R(-) in position 1)
  – S cannot be in position 3 (guess 2 showed S(-) in position 3)
  – S is also already known not to be in position 4 (from guess 1)

So R must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (positions 3 and 4 are eliminated)
I can be anywhere, but must be present.

Let’s build a word with R, S, I and no forbidden letters (A, O, E, K, Y).

I’ll try CRISP:
- C, R, I, S, P
- All letters allowed
- R is in position 2 – allowed
- S is in position 4 – forbidden (S was already ruled out of position 4 by guess 1). So no good.

Try FRISS – but that has a double S and uses S twice; we don’t know if the word allows double letters, and we also need to avoid doubles here for maximum info.

Try SPIRE:
- S, P, I, R, E – but E is forbidden.

Try DRIPS:
- D, R, I, P, S
- Contains R, I, S, no forbidden letters
- R is in position 2 – allowed
- S is in position 5 – allowed
- Other positions unrestricted by previous feedback

DRIPS satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RISKY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) S(-) K(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) I(-) P(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Letters that MUST appear: R, S, I  
(They were all marked “-” in at least one guess, meaning present but not in that exact spot.)

Letters that CANNOT appear: A, O, E, K, Y, D, P  
(They received “x” somewhere.)

Positions that are still possible for each of the required letters:

R  
- Eliminated from positions 1 (RISKY), 2 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 3, 4, 5

S  
- Eliminated from positions 3 (RISKY), 4 (AROSE), 5 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 1, 2

I  
- Eliminated from positions 2 (RISKY), 3 (DRIPS)  
- Still allowed: 1, 4, 5

We also know the word must use only remaining legal letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus R, S, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, S, I exactly once each  
- R not in 1 or 2, S only in 1 or 2, I only in 1, 4 or 5  
- Only uses legal letters

Quick check of constraints:
- If S is in 1, then I can be 4 or 5 and R can be 3,4,5 (but must be distinct)  
- If S is in 2, then I can be 1,4,5 and R can be 3,4,5

Let me try SIR (but that’s only 3 letters) – need 5.  
Try SIR plus two more legal letters in legal positions.

A word that fits: SIR with two more letters; the simplest is to put them at the end.

Consider SIR plus two more letters that are legal:

- S I R _ _  → R would be in position 3 ✓  
  Need two more letters, not repeating, legal.  
  Let’s try SIR + N + T → SIRNT (not a real word)

Try the reverse: put S in 2, I in 1, R in 4.

I S _ R _  
Need a third letter that is legal and fits.  
I S T R _ – IS T R _ → try IS TR_ → ISTR_  
ISTRA is not valid.

Try S I R _ _ again but use real 5-letter words:

SIR is the base; perhaps S I R V E – but E is forbidden.

Try F R I S … but FRISK has K (forbidden).

Try C R I S … CRISP is P forbidden.

Try S C R I _ → SCRIB, SCRIM, SCRIP – SCRIP has P forbidden.

Try S H I R _ → SHIRT – but T is allowed.

Check SHIRT:
Letters: S, H, I, R, T – all allowed  
Positions:
- S in 1 – allowed  
- H in 2 – legal  
- I in 3 – but I was eliminated from 3 (DRIPS showed I(-) in position 3) → so I is in the word but NOT in 3.  
  Thus SHIRT has I in 3 – invalid.

Try S T I R _ → STIR _ – STIRP has P (invalid).

Try S H R I _ → SHRI_ – SHRIM (invalid).

Try S C R I _ → SCRIM – again I in 4, but CRISP already ruled P out and I in 3.

Let me list valid English 5-letter words with exactly R, S, I and no forbidden letters.

Real words fitting: CRISP (P forbidden), FRISK (K), SHIRT (I in 3 invalid), SKIRT (K), STIRS (S twice), etc.

A good one remaining: IRONS – no, O forbidden.

Try R I S _ _ → RIS _ _ – RISEN (E forbidden), RISKY (K,Y forbidden).

Try S I R _ _ → SIR _ _ – SIREN (E), SIRUP (U,P – P forbidden).

Try S _ I R _ → S _ I R _ → S C I R _ – not a word.

Try S _ _ I R → S W I R L – has L, W, but L allowed.  
SWIRL: letters S,W,I,R,L – all allowed  
Positions:
- S in 1 – allowed  
- W in 2 – allowed  
- I in 3 – but I is eliminated from 3 (DRIPS showed I(-) in 3) – invalid.

Try S _ _ R I → S P R I T – P invalid.

Try S _ R _ I → S T R I P – P invalid.

Try S _ I _ R → S K I R T – K invalid.

Try S I _ R _ → S I C R _ – SIC R _ – SICRA (invalid)

Let me systematically try S in 1, I in 4, R in 3: S _ R I _  
S C R I B – CRIB is 4 letters.

Actually a valid candidate: CRISP is invalid (P), but maybe CRIS_ is not.

Let me try building it differently:  
R must be 3,4,5. S must be 1,2. I must be 1,4,5.

Try S in 1, I in 4, R in 3: S _ R I _  
S T R I C – STRIC not a word.

S C R I B – SCRIB not a real word.

S C R I M – SCRIM is a word.

Check SCRIM:
Letters: S, C, R, I, M – all allowed  
Positions:
- S in 1 – allowed  
- C in 2 – allowed  
- R in 3 – allowed (R is in word, not ruled out of 3)  
- I in 4 – allowed (I not ruled out of 4)  
- M in 5 – allowed  
No forbidden letters.  
This fits every constraint.

Guess 4: SCRIM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SCRIM:

- S(✓)  → S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).
- C(x)  → C is not in the word at all.
- R(✓)  → R is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- I(✓)  → I is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- M(x)  → M is not in the word at all.

So we now know:

- The word starts with S, has R in the 3rd position, and I in the 4th position: S _ R I _
- Letters ruled out so far: A, O, E, K, Y, D, P, C, M
- Still allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, plus the known fixed letters S, R, I.

We now need to find a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ R I _ using the remaining allowed letters. The second letter can be any of B, F, G, H, J, L, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, and the fifth letter can be any of the same set, but must form a real word.

Looking for real English words matching S _ R I _:

- S B R I B – invalid
- S F R I F – invalid
- S F R I T – “SPRIT” is a word, but S P R I T, and P is ruled out.
- S T R I P – P is ruled out.
- S T R I C – C is ruled out.
- S T R I D – D is ruled out.
- S T R I N – “STIRN” is archaic, but “STIRN” is a word.
- S T R I T – no.
- S T R I X – “STIRX” is not a word.
- S T R I B – no.
- S T R I G – “STRIG” is a word (a type of owl or archaic term).
- S T R I D – D is ruled out.
- S T R I F – no.
- S T R I B – no.
- S T R I N – “STIRN” is valid.
- S T R I X – no.
- S T R I G – “STRIG” is valid.

Between “STIRN” and “STRIG”, “STIRN” is more common in crosswords and dictionaries. However, “STIRN” is archaic, while “STRIG” is also obscure. Let me try another approach.

Let me check S _ R I _ again:

- S B R I N – “SBRIN” invalid.
- S F R I T – “SFRIT” invalid.
- S G R I N – “SGRIN” invalid.
- S H R I N – “SHRIN” is not a word, but “SHRINE” is too long.
- S N R I P – P is ruled out.
- S T R I N – “STIRN” is valid (archaic word for “stern” or “forehead”).
- S T R I G – “STRIG” is valid (a type of owl or to strip).

Between the two, “STIRN” is more commonly accepted in modern dictionaries as an archaic variant.

Therefore, the most likely candidate is “STIRN”.

Let me check if there are any other valid common words:

- S T R I N – “STIRN”
- S T R I G – “STRIG”
- S T R I T – no.
- S T R I X – no.

“STIRN” seems to be the best fit.
