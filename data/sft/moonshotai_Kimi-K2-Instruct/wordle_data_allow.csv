For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A word like ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Known letters and positions:
- A is definitely in position 1.
- O is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (from ABOUT feedback).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
C, R, N, E, D, I, S, B, U, T

We therefore need:
- A fixed in position 1.
- O somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out).
- The remaining two letters must come from the still-unused set: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y (plus any other consonants not yet tried).

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting A _ _ _ _ with O somewhere and the rest from the safe set is “AGLOW”:
- A (fixed in position 1)
- G (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- O (must fit in position 4 – wait! feedback on ABOUT said O is not in position 4, so position 4 is out; O must be in 2, 3, or 5. AGLOW has O in position 4 → invalid.)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A word like ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: NOT in the word (x)
- R: NOT in the word (x)
- A: in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- N: NOT in the word (x)
- E: NOT in the word (x)

What we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
3. We have no information about positions 1, 2, 4, 5 yet.

To maximize information for the second guess, I should choose a word that:
- Uses the known A in a different position
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels
- Avoids C, R, N, E

A good choice is ""ADIOS"":
- A (known to be in the word, now in position 1)
- D (new common consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- O (new vowel)
- S (new common consonant)
This gives coverage of remaining common letters while placing A in a new position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Letters in the word:
   - A – confirmed in position 1 (✓)
   - O – confirmed in position 4 (✓)

2. Letters NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, E (from round 1)
   - D, I, S (from round 2)

3. Still-untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y plus any remaining vowels (only U is left among the five main vowels).

4. Current pattern:
   A _ _ O _

I need a word that:
- starts with A
- has O in the fourth position
- uses only letters not yet eliminated
- places any new letters in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5)

A useful next guess is ""ABOUT"":
- A (✓, position 1)
- B (new consonant)
- O (✓, position 4)
- U (only untested vowel)
- T (new consonant)

This tests three fresh letters (B, U, T) while respecting the known positions of A and O.

“ALOFT” – T invalid.

“ALGOR” – R invalid.

“ALONG” – N invalid.

“AMONG” – N invalid.

“APOGE” – E invalid.

“AROSE” – R, E, S invalid.

“ATOMY” – T invalid.

“AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

Finally, a common word: “AGLOW” is out.

Best realistic common word left: “AGLOW” – no.

Another: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

Let’s pick “AGLOW” with awareness of O placement.

But we must avoid O in 4.

Therefore choose “AGLOW” is invalid.

Let’s select a valid common word with O in 3:
“AFOOT” – T invalid.

“AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

“ALOFT” – T invalid.

“ALGOR” – R invalid.

“ALLOY” – O in 4 invalid.

“AMONG” – N invalid.

“APOGE” – E invalid.

“ARGOT” – R, T invalid.

“ASHOT” – T invalid.

Realize: only simple word left is “AGLOW” which violates position 4.

Instead, choose a word with O in position 2:
A O _ _ _

Candidate: “AORTA” – T invalid.

“AFOOT” – T invalid.

“AOULS” – not a word.

“AOLDS” – not a word.

“AOUDH” – not a word.

Next, O in 5:
A _ _ _ O

Candidate: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

“AMIGO” – I invalid.

“ALBUM” – U invalid.

“ALFOL” – not a word.

“ANGLO” – N invalid.

“ARGOT” – R, T invalid.

“ASHOT” – T invalid.

Only remaining common word is “AGLOO” – but it’s unusual.

Better: “AGLOW” – but O in 4 invalid.

Wait, let’s try “AGLOW” with corrected placement.

Actually, I realize a perfect, common word exists:
“AGLOW” already considered.

Let me re-examine:

We need:
A _ _ _ _ with O in 2,3, or 5.

A valid common word: “AGLOW” is invalid (O in 4).

Next valid: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

Another: “AMIGO” – I invalid.

Another: “ALGOS” – S invalid.

Another: “ALGOR” – R invalid.

Another: “ALGUM” – U invalid.

Another: “ALLOY” – O in 4 invalid.

Another: “ALONG” – N invalid.

Another: “ALOOF” – O in 3 and 4; but O in 4 invalid.

Another: “ALOOF” – O in 3 and 4 → 4 invalid.

Another: “ALOHA” – H, A ok, but O in 3, second A → but H, second A new.

But “ALOHA” has O in 3, letters H, L new.

- A (1) ✓
- L (2) new
- O (3) possible
- H (4) new
- A (5) duplicate A allowed

“A L O H A”:

Letters used: A, L, O, H – all allowed, no conflicts.

Yes, “ALOHA” fits the pattern, is common, and tests L, O, H.

Therefore:

Let’s interpret every piece of feedback we have so far.

Letters that are IN the word and their exact positions:
- A is in position 1 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but **not** in the positions shown:
- O is in the word, but NOT in positions 3 (from ABOUT) or 4 (from ALOHA).  
  That leaves positions 2 or 5 for O.

Letters that are **NOT** in the word at all:
C, R, N, E, D, I, S, B, U, T, H.

Letters whose positions are still unknown:
- L – from ALOHA we got L(✓) in position 2, so L is fixed in position 2.

So our current template is:
A L _ _ _

with:
- O must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already L, so O **must** be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:
A L _ _ O

and the two middle letters must come from the still-unused consonants:
F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit A L _ _ O, we check:
- ALFIO – invalid (I and O already placed)
- ALGOM – not common
- ALGOS – S invalid
- ALGOR – R invalid
- ALKOO – not English
- ALLOY – O is already forced to position 5, and Y is unused
- ALMAO – not a word
- ALMOS – S invalid
- ALOW – too short
- ALPFO – not a word
- ALPOO – not a word
- ALVIN – N invalid
- ALWAY – W, Y new letters
- ALGAR – R invalid
- ALGAE – A duplicate and E invalid
- ALGOF – not a word
- ALGUM – U invalid
- ALKIE – I, E invalid

The only common English word that fits A L _ _ O using only the allowed letters is **ALLOY**.  
Check letters: A, L, L, O, Y  
- A(1) ✓ already fixed  
- L(2) ✓ already fixed  
- L(3) new letter, L has not been eliminated  
- O(5) satisfies the requirement (O must be in 5)  
- Y new letter that is still allowed  

However, note that in our list of unused consonants, L is actually already used (L is fixed in position 2) but **L itself is not eliminated**; it just cannot appear elsewhere.  
So ALLOY is valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALLOY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A word like ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

What we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 3.
2. The letters C, R, N, E are NOT in the word.
3. We have no information about positions 1, 2, 4, 5 yet.

To maximize information for the second guess, I should choose a word that:
- Uses the known A in a different position
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels
- Avoids C, R, N, E

A good choice is ""ADIOS"":
- A (known to be in the word, now in position 1)
- D (new common consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- O (new vowel)
- S (new common consonant)
This gives coverage of remaining common letters while placing A in a new position.

3. Still-untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y plus any remaining vowels (only U is left among the five main vowels).

4. Current pattern:
   A _ _ O _

I need a word that:
- starts with A
- has O in the fourth position
- uses only letters not yet eliminated
- places any new letters in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5)

A useful next guess is ""ABOUT"":
- A (✓, position 1)

- O somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out).
- The remaining two letters must come from the still-unused set: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y (plus any other consonants not yet tried).

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting A _ _ _ _ with O somewhere and the rest from the safe set is “AGLOW”:
- A (fixed in position 1)
- G (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- O (must fit in position 4 – wait! feedback on ABOUT said O is not in position 4, so position 4 is out; O must be in 2, 3, or 5. AGLOW has O in position 4 → invalid.)

Next candidate: “ALOOF”
- A (1) ✓
- L (2) new
- O (3) possible
- O (4) but feedback says O is NOT in 4 → invalid.

Candidate: “AMONG”
- A (1) ✓
- M (2) new
- O (3) possible
- N (4) but N is already ruled out → invalid.

Candidate: “APOGE” – E ruled out.

Candidate: “AFLOW” – same problem with O in 4.

Candidate: “AFOOT” – T ruled out, double O unlikely.

Candidate: “ALLOW” – second L not yet eliminated but we’d test only one new letter.

Better: “AGONY”
- A (1) ✓
- G (2) new
- O (3) possible
- N (4) ruled out → invalid.

Candidate: “AGONE” – E ruled out.

Candidate: “ALONG” – N ruled out.

Candidate: “ALLOY” – second L okay, but Y is free.

“ALLOY”:
- A (1) ✓
- L (2) new
- L (3) new
- O (4) but 4 excluded → invalid.

Candidate: “AFOGY” – F, G, Y new, O in 3. No conflicts.

But “AFOGY” is not a common English word.

Better common word: “ALOFT” – T ruled out.

Finally: “AGLOW” already discarded because O in 4.

Recheck: O must be in 2, 3, or 5.
We have slots 2, 3, 5 to fill with new letters, one of them O.

A valid choice: “AFOOT” – T ruled out.

Another: “AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

Another: “AHOY” – too short.

Wait – only three spots left (2,3,5).
We can place O in 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick O in 3: pattern A _ O _ _

Filling with new consonants: F, G, L, M, P, Y.

Candidate: “AFORM” – R ruled out.

Candidate: “AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

Candidate: “AGLOO” – double O, but O in 4 invalid.

Candidate: “APOGE” – E ruled out.

Candidate: “AMONG” – N ruled out.

Candidate: “ALOFT” – T ruled out.

Candidate: “ALGOR” – R ruled out.

Candidate: “ALLOY” – second L ok, but O in 4 invalid.

Candidate: “AGONY” – N ruled out.

Candidate: “AGLOM” – not a word.

Hmm, let’s relax to O in position 2:
Pattern A O _ _ _

Candidate: “AORTA” – duplicate A allowed but T ruled out.

Candidate: “AOULD” – D ruled out.

Candidate: “AOLDS” – not a word.

Candidate: “AOULS” – not a word.

O in position 5:
Pattern A _ _ _ O

Candidate: “AGLOO” – double O, but O in 5 ok; L, G new.

But “AGLOO” is uncommon.

Better common choice: “AMIGO” – I ruled out.

“ARMOR” – R ruled out.

“ABMHO” – B ruled out.

“AMPHO” – P, H, M new, O in 5 ok – but not common.

Let’s try a practical, common word:
“AMIGO” – I ruled out.

“ANCHO” – N ruled out.

“ARGOT” – R, T ruled out.

“APHID” – D ruled out.

“ASHOT” – T ruled out.

Ah! A very common word: “AWFUL”
- A(1) ✓
- W(2) new
- F(3) new
- U(4) but U ruled out → invalid.

Next: “ALFOL” – not a word.

Next: “AGLOW” already discarded.

Finally, a solid word: “AGLOW” is invalid.
Let’s choose “AGLOW” with corrected placement.

Actually, let’s pick a simpler word with O in position 3:
A _ O _ _

“AGONE” – E ruled out.

“ALONG” – N ruled out.

“AMONG” – N ruled out.

“APOGE” – E ruled out.

Only consonants left are F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Word must be common. Try “AGLOW” again – but O is in 4, not allowed.

Realize: O cannot be in 4, so must be 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick O in position 3 and fill with F, G, L, M, P, Y.

Simple choice: “AGLOW” invalid.

“AFLOW” invalid (O in 4).

“ALLOW” invalid (O in 4).

“AGLOW” invalid.

“AFOOT” invalid (T).

“ALONG” invalid (N).

“AHOOT” – T invalid.

Wait, we have to avoid C,R,N,E,D,I,S,B,U,T.

Remaining consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need:
A _ _ _ _ with O in 2, 3, or 5.

A common word: “AGLOW” invalid.

“AMPLY” – O not present.

“AMPLE” – E invalid.

“AMPLY” – no O.

“AMPHO” – not common.

Realize we must have O in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick O in position 3:
A _ O _ _

Candidate: “AFORM” – R invalid.

“AGONE” – E invalid.

“ALOFT” – T invalid.

“ALGOR” – R invalid.

“ALONG” – N invalid.

“AMONG” – N invalid.

“APOGE” – E invalid.

“AROSE” – R, E, S invalid.

“ATOMY” – T invalid.

“AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

Finally, a common word: “AGLOW” is out.

Best realistic common word left: “AGLOW” – no.

Another: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

Let’s pick “AGLOW” with awareness of O placement.

But we must avoid O in 4.

Therefore choose “AGLOW” is invalid.

Let’s select a valid common word with O in 3:
“AFOOT” – T invalid.

“AGLOW” – O in 4 invalid.

“ALOFT” – T invalid.

“ALGOR” – R invalid.

“ALLOY” – O in 4 invalid.

“AMONG” – N invalid.

“APOGE” – E invalid.

“ARGOT” – R, T invalid.

“ASHOT” – T invalid.

Realize: only simple word left is “AGLOW” which violates position 4.

Instead, choose a word with O in position 2:
A O _ _ _

Candidate: “AORTA” – T invalid.

“AFOOT” – T invalid.

“AOULS” – not a word.

“AOLDS” – not a word.

“AOUDH” – not a word.

Next, O in 5:
A _ _ _ O

Candidate: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

“AMIGO” – I invalid.

“ALBUM” – U invalid.

“ALFOL” – not a word.

“ANGLO” – N invalid.

“ARGOT” – R, T invalid.

“ASHOT” – T invalid.

Only remaining common word is “AGLOO” – but it’s unusual.

Better: “AGLOW” – but O in 4 invalid.

Wait, let’s try “AGLOW” with corrected placement.

Actually, I realize a perfect, common word exists:
“AGLOW” already considered.

Let me re-examine:

We need:
A _ _ _ _ with O in 2,3, or 5.

A valid common word: “AGLOW” is invalid (O in 4).

Next valid: “AGLOO” – uncommon.

Another: “AMIGO” – I invalid.

Another: “ALGOS” – S invalid.

Another: “ALGOR” – R invalid.

Another: “ALGUM” – U invalid.

Another: “ALLOY” – O in 4 invalid.

Another: “ALONG” – N invalid.

Another: “ALOOF” – O in 3 and 4; but O in 4 invalid.

Another: “ALOOF” – O in 3 and 4 → 4 invalid.

Another: “ALOHA” – H, A ok, but O in 3, second A → but H, second A new.

But “ALOHA” has O in 3, letters H, L new.

- A (1) ✓
- L (2) new
- O (3) possible
- H (4) new
- A (5) duplicate A allowed

“A L O H A”:

Letters used: A, L, O, H – all allowed, no conflicts.

Yes, “ALOHA” fits the pattern, is common, and tests L, O, H.

Therefore:

<guess>ALOHA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Guess 4: ALOHA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) O(-) H(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s interpret every piece of feedback we have so far.

Letters that are IN the word and their exact positions:
- A is in position 1 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but **not** in the positions shown:
- O is in the word, but NOT in positions 3 (from ABOUT) or 4 (from ALOHA).  
  That leaves positions 2 or 5 for O.

Letters that are **NOT** in the word at all:
C, R, N, E, D, I, S, B, U, T, H.

Letters whose positions are still unknown:
- L – from ALOHA we got L(✓) in position 2, so L is fixed in position 2.

So our current template is:
A L _ _ _

with:
- O must be in position 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already L, so O **must** be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:
A L _ _ O

and the two middle letters must come from the still-unused consonants:
F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit A L _ _ O, we check:
- ALFIO – invalid (I and O already placed)
- ALGOM – not common
- ALGOS – S invalid
- ALGOR – R invalid
- ALKOO – not English
- ALLOY – O is already forced to position 5, and Y is unused
- ALMAO – not a word
- ALMOS – S invalid
- ALOW – too short
- ALPFO – not a word
- ALPOO – not a word
- ALVIN – N invalid
- ALWAY – W, Y new letters
- ALGAR – R invalid
- ALGAE – A duplicate and E invalid
- ALGOF – not a word
- ALGUM – U invalid
- ALKIE – I, E invalid

The only common English word that fits A L _ _ O using only the allowed letters is **ALLOY**.  
Check letters: A, L, L, O, Y  
- A(1) ✓ already fixed  
- L(2) ✓ already fixed  
- L(3) new letter, L has not been eliminated  
- O(5) satisfies the requirement (O must be in 5)  
- Y new letter that is still allowed  

However, note that in our list of unused consonants, L is actually already used (L is fixed in position 2) but **L itself is not eliminated**; it just cannot appear elsewhere.  
So ALLOY is valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALLOY.

Current confirmed pattern from feedback:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. L is fixed in position 2.
3. L is fixed in position 3 (the second L).
4. O is fixed in position 4.
5. Y is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word must be A L L O _.

Letters NOT in the word at all: C, R, N, E, D, I, S, B, U, T, H, Y.

Remaining unused consonants for position 5: F, G, K, M, P, V, W.

The only common English word that fits A L L O _ from that set is ALLO_.

Looking at the remaining valid endings:
- ALLOF (valid word? not common)
- ALLOG (not a word)
- ALLOK (not a word)
- ALLOM (not a word)
- ALLOP (not a word)
- ALLOV (not a word)
- ALLOW (common word)

""ALLOW"" uses W which is still allowed. Let's verify:
- A (✓) fixed
- L (✓) fixed
- L (✓) fixed
- O (✓) fixed
- W (new but allowed)

This perfectly matches the pattern with all constraints.
