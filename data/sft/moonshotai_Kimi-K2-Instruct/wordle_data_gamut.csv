For the first guess, I want to choose a word that gives me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

I now know:
- No R, O, S, E anywhere.  
- A exists, but it’s NOT in the first position.

Next guess should avoid those five letters entirely and place A somewhere other than first. Good fresh consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, etc. I’ll pick a word with A in position 2 or later and use a new set of common letters to keep maximizing information.

A solid candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Contains A? No, so skip.
Next candidate: “CLANT” (but T is already in UNTIL and CLANT repeats nothing new).

Better fresh word: “PLANT”
- Uses P, L, N, T and keeps A in position 3.

However, we can do even better on letter coverage. Let’s try “CLAPT” – but T already tested.

Actually, a cleaner choice avoiding all excluded letters is “PAINT”:
- P, I, N, T are fresh and common; A is in position 2 (not first).  
- No R, O, S, E.

So I’ll go with PAINT.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).
   - T is in the correct position (position 5).
   - P, I, N are NOT in the word.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ T
And we know the letters that have been ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, I, N.

This leaves us with available letters that haven’t been used yet. The common ones remaining are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that fits the pattern _ A _ _ T using only the allowed letters and avoiding the ruled-out ones.

Possible candidates:
- B A C K T → But “BACKT” isn’t a valid word.
- C A B L T → “CABLT” isn’t valid.
- G A U G T → “GAUGT” isn’t valid.
- H A U L T → “HAUL T” isn’t a word.

- M A R T _ → R is ruled out.
- L A U N T → “LAUNT” isn’t a word.

A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\nAfter considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ T  (positions 2 and 5 are locked as A and T).
- Letters definitively ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, V, L.
- Letters still permitted (not yet tried) for the three open spots: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
  But U was just tried in position 3 and got “-” (it belongs in the word but not in slot 3), so U must occupy either slot 1 or slot 4.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches:
- Slot 1: any allowed consonant (avoiding the ruled-out set)
- Slot 2: A (fixed)
- Slot 3: any allowed consonant except U
- Slot 4: either U or another allowed consonant (but U must appear somewhere)
- Slot 5: T (fixed)

Because U must appear exactly once (it got “-”, so it’s in the word once) and it can’t be in position 3, let’s test placing U in position 4.

Candidate structure: ? A ? U T

Good consonants left for the first and third positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, W, etc.

Try B for position 1 and C for position 3 → B A C U T → “BACUT” – not a valid word.  
Try C for position 1 and B for position 3 → C A B U T → “CABUT” – not a word.  
Try G for position 1 and U for position 3 – no, U can’t be in position 3.  
Try G for position 1 and D for position 3 → G A D U T → “GADUT” – not a word.  
Try H for position 1 and U in position 4 → H A ? U T – need middle consonant: H A M U T – “HAMUT” – not a word.  
Try M for position 1 → M A ? U T – use B: M A B U T – “MABUT” – not a word.  
Try C for position 1 and M for position 3 → C A M U T – “CAMUT” – not a word.  
Try B for position 1 and U in position 1 → B U A ? T – no, because slot 2 must be A.

Let’s switch to U in position 1 instead:

Structure: U A ? ? T – then the third and fourth positions must be consonants from the allowed set, and they need to form a real word.

Possible middle consonant pairs:  
- U A B B T – no.  
- U A C K T – “UACKT” – no.  
- U A G A T – contains A twice (already have A in slot 2).  
- U A G G T – no.  
- U A G U T – no.  
- U A G E T – E is out.  
- U A G H T – “UAGHT” – no.  
- U A G R T – R is out.  
- U A G A T – A already used.  
- U A G U T – U already used.  
- U A G N T – N is out.

Hmm, let’s look for real words that fit _ A _ _ T with U somewhere inside, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Known valid English words ending in “…AT” with A in slot 2:  
- GAMUT – but G, A, M, U, T – M is allowed (not ruled out). Let me check:  
  - positions: G(1) A(2) M(3) U(4) T(5).  
  - ruled-out letters: none of G, M, U, T are ruled out (except U must be in the word).  
  - Pattern fits _ A _ _ T, U is used once in an allowed slot (position 4), and no forbidden letters.

“GAMUT” is a valid word. It satisfies every constraint:  
- A in position 2 (✓)  
- T in position 5 (✓)  
- U appears exactly once and is not in position 3 (✓)  
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, N, V, L appear.  
Let’s use “GAMUT” as the next guess.
