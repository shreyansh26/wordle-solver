For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these letters without repeating any. Popular first guesses include words like:
- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ROAST
- ARISE

Among these, ""STARE"" seems particularly strong because it contains S, T, A, R, E - which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Good next guesses should:

Feedback summary so far:

Letters we **know** are in the word: T, A, E

Letters we still don’t know about: every other letter (C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

From TABLE we also learned that L is in the word (it got “-” = wrong position, so it’s there somewhere).

So the confirmed letters we must use are: T, A, E, L (each must appear at least once).  
Positions ruled out:

- T is not in spot 2 (STARE) or spot 1 (TABLE)  
- A is not in spot 3 (STARE) or spot 2 (TABLE)  
- E is not in spot 5 (STARE) or spot 5 (TABLE)  
- L is not in spot 4 (TABLE)

We have 5 letters to place, and we already have 4 distinct letters (T, A, E, L). We need one more letter that has not been tested yet. The simplest choice is to add another common consonant that hasn’t appeared, e.g. N, forming LATEN (a valid 5-letter word = past tense of “late” as a verb). Let’s check positions:

LATEN  
- L at 1 (not ruled out)  
- A at 2 (not ruled out)  
- T at 3 (not ruled out)  
- E at 4 (not ruled out)

Current state:
- Letters that must appear in the word (at least once each): T, A, E, L  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, R, B, N

  – T: not in positions 2 (STARE), 1 (TABLE), 3 (LATEN)

  – E: not in positions 5 (STARE), 5 (TABLE), 4 (LATEN)
  – L: not in positions 4 (TABLE), 1 (LATEN)

That leaves only one position each for T, A, E, L:
- T can only be in positions 4 or 5  
- A can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3  
- L can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word containing exactly these four distinct letters plus one more letter that has not yet been tried (and it must be a valid 5-letter word). A simple way to meet this is to insert a duplicate of one of the four known letters, because otherwise we’d have to introduce a brand-new letter that might not fit any known 5-letter word.

The most common pattern that works is to have one of the letters appear twice. Let’s try putting E twice to satisfy the placement constraints.

Candidate placements:
E _ _ _ _   (E in 1)
E A _ _ _   (A must be 4 or 5)
E _ T _ _   (T must be 4 or 5)
E _ _ L _   (L must be 2,3,4,5)

One valid word that uses T, A, E, L with E twice is “ELATE”.

Let’s check positions:
E – allowed in position 1  
L – allowed in position 2  
A – allowed in position 3 (but LATEN said A is not in position 2; it didn’t rule out 3, so it’s allowed)  
T – allowed in position 4 (no rule against it)  
E – allowed in position 5 (no rule against it)

So “ELATE” is legal to try.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these letters without repeating any. Popular first guesses include words like:
- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ROAST
- ARISE

Among these, ""STARE"" seems particularly strong because it contains S, T, A, R, E - which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- S is not in the word (x).  
- T is somewhere in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- R is not in the word (x).  
- E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5 (-).

We know T, A, and E are in the word, but not where they were in STARE (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively). R and S are excluded.

Good next guesses should:
1. Reuse T, A, E in new positions.  
2. Avoid S and R.  
3. Try new common consonants (N, L, C, D, M) and vowels (I, O, U).

A word that satisfies these: “TABLE”  
- Uses T, A, E in new spots.  
- Adds new common letters B and L (B and L haven't been tested yet).  
- Keeps word valid (no S or R).

Let’s try it.

Letters we **know** are in the word: T, A, E  
Letters we **know** are **not** in the word: S, R, B  
Letters we still don’t know about: every other letter (C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

From TABLE we also learned that L is in the word (it got “-” = wrong position, so it’s there somewhere).

So the confirmed letters we must use are: T, A, E, L (each must appear at least once).  
Positions ruled out:

- T is not in spot 2 (STARE) or spot 1 (TABLE)  
- A is not in spot 3 (STARE) or spot 2 (TABLE)  
- E is not in spot 5 (STARE) or spot 5 (TABLE)  
- L is not in spot 4 (TABLE)

We have 5 letters to place, and we already have 4 distinct letters (T, A, E, L). We need one more letter that has not been tested yet. The simplest choice is to add another common consonant that hasn’t appeared, e.g. N, forming LATEN (a valid 5-letter word = past tense of “late” as a verb). Let’s check positions:

LATEN  
- L at 1 (not ruled out)  
- A at 2 (not ruled out)  
- T at 3 (not ruled out)

From all guesses so far we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word: T, A, E, L (each appeared with a – or ✓ at least once).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, R, B, N.
3. Exact position confirmed: T is in spot 4 (✓ in ELATE).
4. Additional positional exclusions:
   - E is *never* in spot 5 (ruled out twice).  
   - A is *never* in spot 2 (ruled out twice).  
   - L is *never* in spot 1 or 4 (ruled out twice).  
   - T is *never* in spots 1, 2, 3 (we just learned it’s definitely in spot 4).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ T _

Remaining letters to place: A, E, L (plus possibly one new letter if any is repeated).

Possible positions left: 1, 2, 3, 5  
- E cannot be in 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3  
- A cannot be in 2 → must be in 1, 3, or 5  
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5

We need a real 5-letter word satisfying all of the above.  
Scanning mental word lists, “LEAPT” fits:

- L 1 – but L is forbidden in 1 (LATEN feedback), so “LEAPT” is impossible.  
Try “LATED”: contains D (unknown yet), but D hasn’t been ruled out.

But we already have four distinct required letters (T,A,E,L). The simplest word using only these four is “TEPAL” (anagram of PETAL), but P hasn’t been tested and we don’t know if it’s allowed.

Instead, let’s reuse one of the four known letters to stay within constraints.  
We need a word of the form _ _ A T _ or _ _ E T _ etc. while avoiding ruled-out positions.

A legal pattern: A E L must appear once each plus the fixed T at 4.  
Trying “E L A T E” but E would be in spot 5 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next candidate: “A L E T E” → E appears twice but E at 5 is still invalid.

Look for a five-letter word using T, A, E, L once each in remaining slots.  
The only arrangement that satisfies every exclusion is:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:  E A L T ?  — but we have no fifth distinct letter left, so we must repeat one of the four.  
The only valid 5-letter word fitting is “E L A T E” which we just saw fails.

Let’s instead insert an untested consonant that doesn’t break any rule.  
The consonants not yet eliminated: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, “D” is common and hasn’t been used. Try the word “DELTA”.

Check positions:

D – new, ok  
E – spot 2 (allowed)  
L – spot 3 (allowed)  
T – spot 4 (confirmed)  
A – spot 5 (allowed, never ruled out)

No positional or letter conflicts.

Next candidate: “A L E T E” → E appears twice but E at 5 is still invalid.

Look for a five-letter word using T, A, E, L once each in remaining slots.  
The only arrangement that satisfies every exclusion is:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:  E A L T ?  — but we have no fifth distinct letter left, so we must repeat one of the four.  
The only valid 5-letter word fitting is “E L A T E” which we just saw fails.

Let’s instead insert an untested consonant that doesn’t break any rule.  
The consonants not yet eliminated: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, “D” is common and hasn’t been used. Try the word “DELTA”.

Check positions:

D – new, ok  
E – spot 2 (allowed)  
L – spot 3 (allowed)  
T – spot 4 (confirmed)  
A – spot 5 (allowed, never ruled out)

No positional or letter conflicts.  
So “DELTA” is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: DELTA -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) L(✓) T(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
