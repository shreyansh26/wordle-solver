Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language (especially vowels and common consonants) to maximize information gain. Good starting words typically include:

- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

Some popular first guesses include:
1. ""AROSE"" - covers A, R, O, S, E
2. ""SLATE"" - covers S, L, A, T, E
3. ""CRANE"" - covers C, R, A, N, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers some of the most common letters in English while maintaining good letter positioning potential.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is confirmed in the correct last position (✓).  
- S is in the word but not in the first position (-).  
- L, A, T are all absent (x).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Has an S somewhere other than position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that ends with E, contains S (not in spot 1), and avoids L, A, T.  
Consonants left that are common and haven’t been used: R, N, D, P, C, M, etc.  
Vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out).

Good options:
- SPREE – uses S and ends in E, but S is first, which is invalid for S.
- SIREN – ends in N, not E.
- NOISE – ends in E and has S not first (positions 3), valid letters.
- CHOSE – ends in E, contains S in position 4, avoids L,A,T.

I'll pick NOISE:
- Ends in E (correct).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Good starting words typically include:

- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

Some popular first guesses include:
1. ""AROSE"" - covers A, R, O, S, E
2. ""SLATE"" - covers S, L, A, T, E
3. ""CRANE"" - covers C, R, A, N, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers some of the most common letters in English while maintaining good letter positioning potential.

- E is confirmed in the correct last position (✓).  
- S is in the word but not in the first position (-).  
- L, A, T are all absent (x).

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Has an S somewhere other than position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that ends with E, contains S (not in spot 1), and avoids L, A, T.  
Consonants left that are common and haven’t been used: R, N, D, P, C, M, etc.  
Vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out).

Good options:
- SPREE – uses S and ends in E, but S is first, which is invalid for S.
- SIREN – ends in N, not E.
- NOISE – ends in E and has S not first (positions 3), valid letters.
- CHOSE – ends in E, contains S in position 4, avoids L,A,T.

I'll pick NOISE:
- Ends in E (correct).  
- S is in position 4 (not 1), satisfying the feedback.  
- Uses N, O, I, none of which were ruled out.

4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, N, O, I.
5. Common letters not yet tried or ruled out: R, D, H, C, M, P, U, B, G, F, Y, etc.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ S E

We need three new letters for positions 1-3, chosen from the still-allowed consonants and vowels.

Aiming for common consonant-vowel-consonant start while avoiding all known-bad letters:

- R, U, C, etc.
- Possible words: CRUSE, DRUSE, PRUSE, etc., but U is still allowed (never tested).
- CRUSE is a valid word (means a small bottle) and uses C, R, U, none of which are ruled out.

From the four rounds of feedback we now have a very tight pattern:

1. Word ends in ...USE (positions 3-5 all ✓).
   Pattern: _ _ U S E

2. R appears in the word, but has been in the wrong place twice:
   - In CRUSE it was in position 2 (marked −).
   - In DRUSE it was again in position 2 (marked −).
   Therefore R must be in position 1, giving:
   Pattern: R _ U S E

3. Letters already shown to be absent: S (position 1), L, A, T, N, O, I, C, D.

The only remaining unknown is position 2.  
Letters used or ruled out so far: L, A, T, N, O, I, C, D, plus the fixed letters R, U, S, E.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit R _ U S E:
- Rouse – but O is already ruled out.
- Reuse – but E is already in position 5.
- Ruses – only 4 letters.
- Russe – not a standard word.

Actually, none of these fit, which suggests a mis-step.  Let me rethink.

The feedback says:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 2 or 4 or 5, and it was not placed in 1 or 3 in any of the guesses).  
- We have not yet tried R in position 1 or 3.

So the only remaining possibilities for R are positions 1 or 3.

But position 3 is already confirmed as U (✓), so R must be in position 1.

That gives: R _ U S E

Now the missing letter for position 2 must not be any of the letters already ruled out (L, A, T, N, O, I, C, D).

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for legal 5-letter English words:
- R B U S E → “r buse” – not a word.
- R F U S E → “refuse” does fit, and F has not been ruled out.
- R G U S E → “r g use” – invalid.
- R H U S E → “rhuse” – archaic spelling of ruse, not standard.
- R M U S E → “rmuse” – invalid.
- R P U S E → “rpuse” – invalid.
- R V U S E → invalid.
- R W U S E → invalid.
- R Y U S E → invalid.

The only standard word remaining is “REFUSE”.

Therefore:
Pattern: R E F U S E – but that’s six letters; the correct spelling is R E F U S E (six letters).  This indicates an error: there is no standard 5-letter word fitting R _ U S E.  The correct realization is that we missed another valid word.

Actually, the 5-letter word “REUSE” has E in position 2, which has not been ruled out (E is only confirmed for position 5).  “REUSE” fits:

R E U S E.

Let me check:
- R in position 1 – never been tried.
- E in position 2 – never been ruled out (only position 5 E is confirmed).
- U S E positions 3-5 all ✓.
- No disallowed letters.

This checks out.

Therefore the next (and final) candidate is REUSE.
