For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE: contains S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE: contains C, R, A, N, E
- ROAST: contains R, O, A, S, T
- RAISE: contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it uses five of the most common letters in English and covers both common vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

The feedback tells us:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (✓), so the final letter is E.

Our next goal is to introduce as many new common letters as possible while keeping the final E fixed. Common remaining consonants and vowels include: R, N, I, O, C, H, B, K, M, P, U.

A good second-guess word should:
1. Keep the final E.
2. Use several of these new common letters.
3. Avoid any already-eliminated letters (S, L, A, T).

Possible candidates:
- CHORE – uses C, H, O, R, E
- PRONE – uses P, R, O, N, E
- URINE – uses U, R, I, N, E
- CRONE – uses C, R, O, N, E

Among these, CHORE introduces C, H, O, R – four new high-value letters while keeping the known E in place.

Let's go with CHORE.
