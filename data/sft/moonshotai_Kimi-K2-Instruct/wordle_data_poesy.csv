For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), which should provide good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all **not in the word** (marked x).

So we need:
1. A 5-letter word that **contains E but not in the 5th position**.
2. The word must **not contain C, R, A, N**.
3. We should pick a word with **new common consonants** (like S, T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, I, U) to get more clues.

Possible candidates:  
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – but N is excluded.

From the new feedback on PEBLY:

- P ✓ : P is in the word and in the **correct** first position.
- E - : E is in the word but **not** in the second position.
- B x : B is **not** in the word.
- L x : L is **not** in the word.
- Y ✓ : Y is in the word and in the **correct** fifth position.

Letters we now **know are in the word** (and their positions):
- P must be at position 1.
- Y must be at position 5.

Letters we know are **not** in the word at all:
C, R, A, N, T, I, D, B, L.

Letters still in play (not yet ruled out):
E (must be somewhere in 2, 3, or 4), plus any unused consonants: F, G, H, K, M, S, V, W, Z, etc.  
Vowels still possible: E, O, U (since A and I are out).

So the word pattern is:
P _ _ _ Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with P and ends with Y.
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. Uses only allowed letters (no C, R, A, N, T, I, D, B, L).

Possible candidates:
- POESY (P-O-E-S-Y) – S is allowed, O and E allowed. Word exists.
- PERKY – but R is excluded.
- PEPSY – no (double P, but E in 2 is allowed, but S allowed, yet PEPSY is not a valid word).
- PESKY – S and K allowed, E in 2, but K is allowed. Word exists.

""PESKY"" fits:
P(1 ✓), E(2 - fits ""E somewhere but not 2""? Wait no: E is in word but NOT in 2. So E cannot be in 2. Must be 3 or 4.

Thus PESKY is invalid since E is in 2 (but we know E is not in 2).

Next candidate: ""POESY"" has E in 3, which is allowed. Check letters: P, O, E, S, Y – none are forbidden. It's a valid word.

Another candidate: ""PUKEY"" – but K is allowed, U allowed, E in 3. But is PUKEY a word? Yes, it's slang for ""disgusting"".

""POESY"" seems more common and fits better. Let's go with that.

Check pattern: P O E S Y
- P(1) ✓
- O: not yet tested (but allowed)
- E(3) : allowed (since E can be in 3 or 4)
- S: allowed
- Y(5) ✓

No rules violated.
