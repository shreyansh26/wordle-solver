For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me broad insights into the secret word's structure. The optimal first word in Wordle typically uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. One of the best starting words is ""RAISE"" because it uses:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant, especially at word endings)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers all five vowels (A, E, I) plus two very common consonants, giving maximum potential to reveal letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in the first position: R _ _ _ _
- A is in the word but not in position 2
- I is not present at all
- S is not present at all
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we need:
1. A word starting with R.
2. A somewhere after position 2 (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. E somewhere before position 5 (positions 2, 3, or 4).
4. No I or S.
5. Letters we haven't tested yet: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z.

Good candidates are words like:
- RATEL (but T not tested and L not tested)
- RAVEN (V not tested, N not tested)
- RAMEN (M not tested, N not tested)
- RAKED (K not tested, D not tested)

Among these, ""RAVEN"" seems promising as it uses common letters and fits the constraints:
- R _ _ _ _ (correct)
- A in position 2 is wrong, but we can try position 3
- E in position 4 (not position 5, so valid)
- No I or S

So far we have:

- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was “-” in both places).
- E is in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it was “-” in both places).
- I, S, V, N are all absent.

Therefore:
1. A must be in position 4 or 5.
2. E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. No repeats of I, S, V, N.
4. We still need two more distinct consonants that haven’t been tried.

Let’s build possible skeletons:

Case 1: E in position 2 → R E _ _ _
   – If A is in position 4 → R E _ A _
     Remaining letters: consonants not yet used {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z}

Case 2: E in position 3 → R _ E _ _
   – If A is in position 4 or 5 → R _ E A _ or R _ E _ A

A quick scan for common English words that fit:

- R E G A L  (REGAL) → fits R E _ A _ ; uses G and L (both new).
- R E M A N  (REMAN) → but N is already excluded.
- R E C A P  (RECAP) → uses C and P (both new).

Let’s consider the two possible placements of A:

1. A in position 3: R E A _ _
   We need two new consonants for positions 4-5 that haven’t been tried. Available: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

   Common words: REACH (but C and H are new), READY (but D and Y are new), REALM (but L is excluded), REACT (T and C are new).

2. A in position 5: R E _ _ A
   Then positions 3-4 need two new consonants. Common words: RELAX (but L and X are new), REPAY (P and Y are new), REGMA (but G is excluded), RETMA (invalid), REDIA (but I is excluded).

Looking at REACH:
- Letters: R E A C H
- C and H are new.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- No used/excluded letters (G, L, I, S, V, N are avoided).
- It’s a valid word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The optimal first word in Wordle typically uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. One of the best starting words is ""RAISE"" because it uses:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant, especially at word endings)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers all five vowels (A, E, I) plus two very common consonants, giving maximum potential to reveal letters in the word or eliminate many possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in the first position: R _ _ _ _
- A is in the word but not in position 2
- I is not present at all
- S is not present at all
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we need:
1. A word starting with R.
2. A somewhere after position 2 (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. E somewhere before position 5 (positions 2, 3, or 4).
4. No I or S.
5. Letters we haven't tested yet: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z.

Good candidates are words like:
- RATEL (but T not tested and L not tested)
- RAVEN (V not tested, N not tested)
- RAMEN (M not tested, N not tested)
- RAKED (K not tested, D not tested)

Among these, ""RAVEN"" seems promising as it uses common letters and fits the constraints:
- R _ _ _ _ (correct)
- A in position 2 is wrong, but we can try position 3
- E in position 4 (not position 5, so valid)
- No I or S
- Adds new letters V and N which haven't been tested yet

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

- R is locked in the first position: R _ _ _ _
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was “-” in both places).
- E is in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it was “-” in both places).
- I, S, V, N are all absent.

Therefore:
1. A must be in position 4 or 5.
2. E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. No repeats of I, S, V, N.
4. We still need two more distinct consonants that haven’t been tried.

Let’s build possible skeletons:

Case 1: E in position 2 → R E _ _ _
   – If A is in position 4 → R E _ A _
     Remaining letters: consonants not yet used {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z}

Case 2: E in position 3 → R _ E _ _
   – If A is in position 4 or 5 → R _ E A _ or R _ E _ A

A quick scan for common English words that fit:

- R E G A L  (REGAL) → fits R E _ A _ ; uses G and L (both new).
- R E M A N  (REMAN) → but N is already excluded.
- R E C A P  (RECAP) → uses C and P (both new).

REGAL looks like a solid third guess: it puts E in position 2, A in position 4, and newly tests G and L.
