For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains frequently occurring letters in English and covers multiple vowels and common consonants. The goal is to maximize the information gained regardless of the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, allowing for more informed subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

- C (in the word, but NOT position 1)

Therefore:

- Uses C and I in allowed positions
- Adds other common consonants and vowels

Candidate: C R I O L

Check positions:
- C (allowed: 2,3,4,5) – we’ll put it at 1? Wait, C is NOT allowed at 1 (feedback said C(-) means C is in word but not position 1). So C must be in 2,3,4, or 5.

Candidate: C R I O L

Check positions:
- C (allowed: 2,3,4,5) – we’ll put it at 1? Wait, C is NOT allowed at 1 (feedback said C(-) means C is in word but not position 1). So C must be in 2,3,4, or 5.
- I (allowed: 1,2,4,5)
- L must be at 5.

Let’s try:
Position 1: I (allowed)
Position 2: C (allowed)
Position 3: R
Position 4: O
Position 5: L (must be here)

Word: I C R O L ? Check if valid: ""ICROL"" – no, not an English word.

Alternate: C in 3, I in 1, L in 5:
1: I
2: ?
3: C
4: ?
5: L

Possible letters: R, O, U, N, M, etc.

Try ""IRCOL"" – not valid.

Try ""C"" in 2, ""I"" in 4:
1: ?
2: C
3: ?
4: I
5: L

Example: R C O I L – ""RCOIL"" – no.

Try with common letters: ""P R I C L"" – no.

Wait, let’s list valid words meeting constraints:
- Must have L in 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are excluded)
- Must contain C and I in allowed positions
- No S,A,T,E,H,D

Known:
- L is in word (positions 1 or 5)
- C is in word (positions 2,3,4,5)
- I is in word (positions 1,2,4,5)

Trying L in 1:
L _ _ _ _ : need C and I in 2,3,4,5 (but not 3 for I), and valid word.

Example: L I C _ _ – ""LIC"" plus two more letters. ""LICOR"" – ""LICOR"" is not 5-letter.

""L I C K _"" – but K is possible, but ""L I C K ?"" – ""LICKS"" – has S (eliminated).

""L I C O N"" – ""LICON"" – not valid.

Trying L in 5:
_ _ _ _ L: need C and I in allowed positions.

""F R I C L"" – ""FRICL"" – no.

""U R I C L"" – ""URICL"" – no.

""N I C O L"" – ""NICOL"" – valid word (variant of Nicholas).

Check constraints:
- N: new, allowed
- I: position 2 (allowed for I: 1,2,4,5) – ok
- C: position 3 (allowed for C: 2,3,4,5) – ok  
- O: new, allowed
- L: position 5 (must be 1 or 5) – ok

So ""NICOL"" fits all constraints.

From all feedback:

Letters confirmed IN the word (all appear as ""-"" at least once):
- L (but NOT positions 2,3,4,5 → must be position 1)
- C (but NOT positions 1,2,3 → must be position 4 or 5)
- I (but NOT positions 2,3 → must be 1,4,5)
- O (but NOT position 4 → must be 1,2,3,5)

Letters eliminated (x):
- S, A, T, E, H, D, N

Thus:
- L must sit in position 1
- C must sit in position 4 or 5
- I must sit in a remaining spot (1,4,5) but 1 is taken by L → so 4 or 5
- O must sit in 2,3 (cannot be 1,4,5 because 1=L, 4/5 are for C/I)

Let’s assemble the only possible pattern:
L _ _ _ _
Since L is fixed at 1, and O must be in 2 or 3, and we still need to place C and I in 4 or 5.

Possible arrangements:
1) L O _ C I
2) L O _ I C
3) L _ O C I
4) L _ O I C

Check which of these form valid 5-letter words with remaining consonants (allowed: B, F, G, K, M, P, R, U, V, W, Y).

Option 4: L _ O I C → missing letter in position 2 → need consonant.
Try “L R O I C” – invalid.
Try “L U O I C” – invalid.

Option 3: L _ O C I → need consonant in position 2.
“L U O C I” – invalid.
“L R O C I” – invalid.
“L G O C I” – invalid.

Option 2: L O _ I C → need consonant in position 3.
“L O B I C” – invalid.

Check constraints:
- L: position 1 ✓
