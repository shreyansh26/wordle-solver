For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, one excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E)
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many possible target words

This should give us maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FREER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, one excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E)
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many possible target words

This should give us maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE is:
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter is R)
- O: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Key constraints learned:
1. R is confirmed in the 2nd position.
2. E is somewhere in the word (but not the 5th position).
3. A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the 2nd letter.
- Contains E somewhere (not in the 5th position).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

Looking for words that fit R in position 2 and include E:
Possible patterns: _ R _ _ _ with E somewhere in positions 1,3, or 4.

Examples: D R E A M (but contains A), C R E E P (but has no E in wrong position), B R E A K (A is invalid), T R I E D (has E in 4th, but let's check letters).

TRIED:
- T, R, I, E, D – none are A, O, or S. R is in position 2. E is in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE). This fits all constraints.

Another quick check: C R I E D – also fits, but TRIED is more common.

3. Letters still allowed (besides R and E):
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

4. We have to fill the blanks in _ R _ E _ from the remaining letters.

Possible words meeting all these constraints:
- B R E E N

- P R E E N
