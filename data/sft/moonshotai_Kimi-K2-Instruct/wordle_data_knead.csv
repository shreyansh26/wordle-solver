For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these frequent letters to quickly eliminate possibilities.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters C, R, A, N, E - covering vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced word with good letter coverage.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-)
- N: in word but wrong position (-)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word definitely contains A, N, E, just not in the positions they were in CRANE (A2, N4, E5). That also means the letters C and R are completely absent from the word.

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, N, E (in some order), does NOT contain C or R, and does not place A in position 2, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

One strategy is to try to place the known letters (A, N, E) into new positions while introducing new common letters. 

Let's consider:
- positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- known letters: A, N, E must appear somewhere
- can't have A in 2, N in 4, E in 5
- can't have C or R anywhere

A possible candidate is ""SLANE"" but S,L aren't confirmed yet. Another approach is to try words that use these letters in different positions. 

""PANES"" could work:
- positions: P,A,N,E,S
- A is in position 2 (but A was in position 2 in CRANE, so this violates the constraint)
  
""NEAPS"":
- N in 1, E in 2, A in 3, P/S new letters
- A is in 3 (was 2, ok), N is 1 (was 4, ok), E is 2 (was 5, ok)

But NEAPS is a nautical term, might be too obscure.

""ANVIL"":
- A,N,V,I,L
- A in 1 (was 2, ok), N in 2 (was 4, ok) - but we don't know about V,I,L

Actually a better approach is to try to place the known letters in new positions while introducing new common letters. ""LEANT"" is possible:
- L,E,A,N,T
- E in 2 (was 5, ok), A in 3 (was 2, ok), N in 4 (but N was in 4 in CRANE, so this violates!)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)

2. NEAPS → N(-) E(-) A(-) P(x) S(x)
   – Letters in word (but wrong positions): N, E, A  (again)
   – Letters NOT in word: P, S

So far we know:
- The word definitely contains A, N, E exactly once each (no duplicates of these letters indicated).
- The letters C, R, P, S are absent.
- A was in position 2 (CRANE) and position 3 (NEAPS); hence A cannot be in 2 or 3.
- N was in position 4 (CRANE) and position 1 (NEAPS); hence N cannot be in 1 or 4.
- E was in position 5 (CRANE) and position 2 (NEAPS); hence E cannot be in 2 or 5.

Remaining positions for each:
- A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word containing A, N, E with no C, R, P, S, and avoiding the forbidden positions.  
A plausible next guess is “ALONE”:
- Letters: A, L, O, N, E – contains A, N, E and introduces L, O.
- Position checks:
  – A in 1 (allowed: not 2 or 3)
  – L, O new letters (no conflict)
  – N in 4 (forbidden because N was in 4 in CRANE) → conflict, so ALONE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ANILE”
- Letters: A, N, I, L, E – contains A, N, E
- Positions:
  – A in 1 (ok)
  – N in 2 (ok)
  – E in 5 (forbidden) → conflict.

Next: “ANEMO” – contains M, O (but O is safe), but ends in O, not E.

Next: “GLEAN”
- Letters: G, L, E, A, N – contains A, N, E
- Positions:
  – G (new)
  – L (new)
  – E in 3 (ok, not 2 or 5)
  – A in 4 (ok, not 2 or 3)
  – N in 5 (ok, not 1 or 4)
No conflicts with known constraints.

Therefore, “GLEAN” is a valid and informative next guess.

- The letters C, R, P, S are absent.
- A was in position 2 (CRANE) and position 3 (NEAPS); hence A cannot be in 2 or 3.
- N was in position 4 (CRANE) and position 1 (NEAPS); hence N cannot be in 1 or 4.
- E was in position 5 (CRANE) and position 2 (NEAPS); hence E cannot be in 2 or 5.

Remaining positions for each:
- A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word containing A, N, E with no C, R, P, S, and avoiding the forbidden positions.  
A plausible next guess is “ALONE”:
- Letters: A, L, O, N, E – contains A, N, E and introduces L, O.
- Position checks:
  – A in 1 (allowed: not 2 or 3)
  – L, O new letters (no conflict)
  – N in 4 (forbidden because N was in 4 in CRANE) → conflict, so ALONE is invalid.

Next candidate: “ANILE”
- Letters: A, N, I, L, E – contains A, N, E
- Positions:
  – A in 1 (ok)
  – N in 2 (ok)
  – E in 5 (forbidden) → conflict.

Next: “ANEMO” – contains M, O (but O is safe), but ends in O, not E.

Next: “GLEAN”
- Letters: G, L, E, A, N – contains A, N, E
- Positions:
  – G (new)
  – L (new)
  – E in 3 (ok, not 2 or 5)
  – A in 4 (ok, not 2 or 3)
  – N in 5 (ok, not 1 or 4)
No conflicts with known constraints.

Therefore, “GLEAN” is a valid and informative next guess.",Guess 3: GLEAN -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(x) E(✓) A(✓) N(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,knead,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these frequent letters to quickly eliminate possibilities.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters C, R, A, N, E - covering vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced word with good letter coverage.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-)
- N: in word but wrong position (-)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word definitely contains A, N, E, just not in the positions they were in CRANE (A2, N4, E5). That also means the letters C and R are completely absent from the word.

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, N, E (in some order), does NOT contain C or R, and does not place A in position 2, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

One strategy is to try to place the known letters (A, N, E) into new positions while introducing new common letters. 

Let's consider:
- positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- known letters: A, N, E must appear somewhere
- can't have A in 2, N in 4, E in 5
- can't have C or R anywhere

A possible candidate is ""SLANE"" but S,L aren't confirmed yet. Another approach is to try words that use these letters in different positions. 

""PANES"" could work:
- positions: P,A,N,E,S
- A is in position 2 (but A was in position 2 in CRANE, so this violates the constraint)
  
""NEAPS"":
- N in 1, E in 2, A in 3, P/S new letters
- A is in 3 (was 2, ok), N is 1 (was 4, ok), E is 2 (was 5, ok)

But NEAPS is a nautical term, might be too obscure.

""ANVIL"":
- A,N,V,I,L
- A in 1 (was 2, ok), N in 2 (was 4, ok) - but we don't know about V,I,L

Actually a better approach is to try to place the known letters in new positions while introducing new common letters. ""LEANT"" is possible:
- L,E,A,N,T
- E in 2 (was 5, ok), A in 3 (was 2, ok), N in 4 (but N was in 4 in CRANE, so this violates!)

""ATONE"":
- A,T,O,N,E
- A in 1 (was 2, ok), N in 4 (was 4 - violates), E in 5 (was 5 - violates)

""STANE"":
- S,T,A,N,E
- A in 3 (was 2, ok), N in 4 (was 4 - violates), E in 5 (was 5 - violates)

""NAVAL"":
- N,A,V,A,L - has A twice, but original doesn't indicate duplicates

""ANELE""?
Too obscure.

""ANODE"":
- A,N,O,D,E
- A in 1 (ok), N in 2 (ok, was 4), E in 5 (violates, was 5)

""LANES"":
- L,A,N,E,S
- A in 2 (violates, was 2), N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok)

""PEANS"":
- P,E,A,N,S
- E in 2 (ok, was 5), A in 3 (ok), N in 4 (violates, was 4)

""NEAPS"" seems the best fit among common words:
- N in 1 (was 4), E in 2 (was 5), A in 3 (was 2) - all new positions
- introduces P,S as new letters

- G and L are completely absent.
- E is in the correct position 3.
- A is in the correct position 4.
- N is in the word but is NOT in position 5.

So far we have:

Known correct positions:
- 3: E
- 4: A

Forbidden letters (never appear): C, R, P, S, G, L

Remaining letters we still need to place:
- N (must appear once, and can be in positions 1, 2, or 3–5; but 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, so N must be in position 1 or 2)
- One more letter (since the word is 5 letters and we already have _ _ E A _ with N in 1 or 2) must be chosen from the rest of the alphabet excluding the forbidden set.

So the pattern is:

[N or ?][N or ?] E A ?

with the second ? being a fresh letter never tried yet, not among C, R, P, S, G, L.

Let’s list remaining common letters that have not been ruled out:
B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 5, possibly 2) with N somewhere in 1 or 2.

Candidate words that fit:
- N E E A ? – but duplicate E is not shown so far; probably no repeats.
- N _ E A _  (N in 1): then 2 and 5 need two new letters. Let’s pick common ones.

Try N in 1 and 2:

Option 1: N in 1 → N _ E A _
We need a letter for 2 and 5 from remaining set.

Option 2: N in 2 → _ N E A _

Let’s pick Option 1 first: N _ E A _
Choose a common consonant for 2 and 5. Let’s try B and D.

“N B E A D” → NBAED – not a word.
“N I E A D” → NIEAD – not a word.
“N I E A M” → NIEAM – not a word.

Option 2: _ N E A _
Positions 1 and 5 open. Pick common consonants.

“B N E A B” – duplicates B.
“M N E A M” – duplicates M.
“D N E A D” – duplicates D.

We need distinct consonants. Try common ones:

“D N E A Y” – DNEAY – not a word.
“T N E A M” – TNEAM – not a word.
“M N E A T” – MNEAT – not a word.

Wait, let’s think of real words.

Real word fitting _ N E A _:
- BNEAK – no.
- INEAK – no.
- INEAR – no.
- KNEAD – yes! K N E A D
K has not been used or ruled out, D hasn’t been used either.

Check constraints:
- K: not ruled out (never appeared)
- N: in position 2 (allowed, since N is allowed in 1 or 2)
- E: position 3 ✓
- A: position 4 ✓
