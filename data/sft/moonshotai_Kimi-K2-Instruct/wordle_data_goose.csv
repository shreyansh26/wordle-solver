3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate as many letters as possible while also testing common patterns. A good first word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Common choices for first words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for determining what letters might be in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.

- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct spot (4th position).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct spot (5th position).

So far we know:
- The word ends in O S E (positions 3-5: O S E).
- A and R are not in the word at all.
- We still need to find the first and second letters, which cannot be A or R.

I need to choose a word that keeps O, S, E fixed in positions 3-5 and tests new letters for positions 1 and 2. A good next guess would test common consonants and vowels that haven't been eliminated yet. The remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

- O _ S _ E pattern (positions 3-5: O S E).

From MOUSE we learned:
- M is not in the word.
- U is not in the word (but the O, S, E confirmation was already known).

So the word must have the form:
_ _ O S E  (letters 3-5 are set).

Letters still allowed for positions 1 & 2: any except A, R, M, U plus the letters already used elsewhere (but those are already locked).  
We still need to test likely consonants at the start. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, T, W, Y.  
Also common vowels for position 2: I, E (E is already used at 5), so mainly I.

Good next guesses would be:
- CHOSE (tests C & H)
- NOOSE (tests N)
- GOOSE (tests G)
- FROSE is invalid (R is out)
- DOUSE is invalid (U is out)

Let’s pick CHOSE because C and H are high-frequency consonants and haven’t been tested yet.

Good vowel possibility: I (only I is left that hasn’t been tried).

Let’s test B and I → B I O S E → “BI OSE” is not a word, but “BI” is fine. The valid word is “BI OSE” → close to “BIOS” but 5 letters. Actually, “BI OSE” is “BI OSE” which is not a word. The correct word candidate is ""BI OSE"" which is invalid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The goal is to eliminate as many letters as possible while also testing common patterns. A good first word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Common choices for first words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for determining what letters might be in the word.

- A and R are not in the word at all.
- We still need to find the first and second letters, which cannot be A or R.

I need to choose a word that keeps O, S, E fixed in positions 3-5 and tests new letters for positions 1 and 2. A good next guess would test common consonants and vowels that haven't been eliminated yet. The remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far we know:

1. Word structure: _ _ O S E  (positions 3-5 are fixed: O S E).
2. Letters definitively NOT in the word (anywhere): A, R, M, U, C, H, N.
3. Therefore the unknown first two letters must be drawn from the remaining alphabet:  
   B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want the most common combination of two letters (especially starting consonants) that can form a valid 5-letter word ending in O S E.

Look at common English 5-letter words ending in “OSE”:
- LOOSE (already considered, but L hasn’t been ruled out)  
- GOOSE (G hasn’t been ruled out)  
- DOUSE (U is ruled out)  
- FROSE (R is ruled out)  
- PROSE (P hasn’t been ruled out)  
- BROSE (B hasn’t been ruled out)  
- GLOZE (Z is possible but uncommon)  
- …

Among these, the ones with the highest frequency initial consonants are:  
G, B, L, P.

Testing the most common one first → G in position 1, O already fixed in 3, so GOOSE was already played.  
Next most common → L in position 1 → LOOSE.

We haven’t ruled out L, so LOOSE is still legal.

What we know so far:

- Pattern: _ _ O S E  
- Letters absolutely ruled-out anywhere: A, R, M, U, C, H, N, L  
- That means positions 1 and 2 must be chosen from: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Among 5-letter English words ending in “OSE”, the only common ones that remain are:

BROSE, DROSE (R is out), FROSE (R is out), GROSE (R is out), PROSE (R is out), BROSE (B and R – R out), DHOSE (invalid), GHOSE (invalid), etc.

The only valid candidate left that fits the remaining letters is “GROSE”, but R is already out. 

Wait – let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in OSE and cross-check:

Valid words:
- BROSE  → B R O S E  (R out)  
- PROSE  → P R O S E  (R out)  
- GROSE  → G R O S E  (R out)  
- DOOSE  (invalid)  
- FOOSE  (invalid)  
- GOOSE  → G O O S E  (already played, O duplicated)  
- JOOSE  (slang, uncommon)  
- KOOSE  (invalid)  
- POOSE  (invalid)  
- TOOSE  (invalid)  
- VOOSE  (invalid)  
- WOOSE  (invalid)  
- YOOSE  (invalid)  
- ZOOSE  (invalid)  

The only remaining plausible, common word is “GROSE”, but R is excluded. This implies the word must use two consecutive consonants that are still allowed.

Let’s look at the remaining combinations:
- B _ O S E  
  only BROSE (R out) – invalid  
- D _ O S E  
  DHOSE (invalid), DROSE (R out) – none  
- F _ O S E  
  FROSE (R out) – none  
- G _ O S E  
  GROSE (R out) – none  
- P _ O S E  
  PROSE (R out) – none  

The next most common consonant not yet used is D. The letter D has not been ruled out, and the only valid word with D is “DOSE”, but that’s 4 letters. There is no standard 5-letter word “DOOSE”.

That leaves us with an obscure but still valid Scrabble word: “BOOSE” (a Scots spelling of “booze”).

Since B hasn’t been ruled out, let’s test “BOOSE”.

(Note: If this is rejected, we’d need to consider other obscure variants or a misspelling, but “BOOSE” is listed in several dictionaries.)
