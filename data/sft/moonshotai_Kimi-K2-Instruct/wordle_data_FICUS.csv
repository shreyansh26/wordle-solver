For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. The best starting words typically include common consonants and a mix of vowels. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"".

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: covers A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll start with ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A x → not in the word
- R x → not in the word
- O x → not in the word
- S – → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E x → not in the word

Letters we now KNOW are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E  
Letters we KNOW are in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S

The secret word must contain S somewhere other than position 4, and must contain none of A, R, O, E.

To build a second guess that uses this information and still tests other common letters, I’ll choose a word that:
- includes S but avoids positions 1 and 4 for it (since AROSE already checked 4),
- avoids the eliminated letters,
- introduces new common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S is now in position 1 (new test spot),
- L, U, M, P are all fresh letters that haven’t appeared yet.

This gives maximal new information while respecting previous feedback.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P, T, N  
Letters known TO be in the word (with current positional info):
- S — correct in position 5 (✓)
- U — in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- I — in the word, but not in position 4 (-)

Allowed letters left (excluding those already ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed S, U, I.

Structure so far:
- Position 5 is S.
- Positions 2 and 4 cannot be U and I respectively.
- We still need two more letters from the allowed list, one in position 1 and one in position 3, plus placing U and I correctly.

Simplest pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
We must use U and I somewhere in positions 1-4, avoiding:
- U in 2
- I in 4

Let’s list possible placements of U and I:
- U in 1,3,4
- I in 1,2,3

But we still need two additional distinct consonants/vowels at the remaining spots, drawn from the allowed set.

A quick scan of common English words ending in S that contain U and I with the above constraints:

“QUIPS” – Q and P are used; P is ruled out.  
“BUICS” – not a common word.  
“DUKIS” – rare.  
“FUGIS” – rare.  
“HUMPS” – M and P are ruled out.  
“GUSTS” – T is ruled out.  
“CUBIS” – uncommon.  
“WHISK” – K is allowed; but only 4 letters plus s… wait, 5 letters.

Actually, “WHISK” is 5 letters and ends in K, not S, so irrelevant.

Wait, we need a common 5-letter word that:
- ends in S,
- uses U and I,
- U not in 2,
- I not in 4,
- letters only from remaining allowed set.

One good candidate: “GUSSY” – but Y is allowed, and we’d have SS, but that is legal. However it does not contain I.

Next: “QUIDS” – Q and D are allowed; but Q is rare and not yet tested, and D is allowed.  
Check constraints:
- Q U I D S
- U not in 2 – yes, it’s in 2 – violation.  
Discard.

“QUBIS” – not a real word.

“VISCUS” – 6 letters.

“CUBSI” – not valid.

“HUSKS” – K and H are allowed, but we already saw S is fixed in 5, and we need both U and I. “HUSKS” lacks I.

“FUSIL” – ends in L, which is ruled out.

“FUSIL” – invalid.

Try “FUGUS” – G and F allowed, but again lacks I.

Next possible: “WISPS” – contains I and S, but not U.

“WUSIS” – not common.

Let’s step back and build systematically.

We know:
- Position 5 = S
- We must use U and I in positions 1-4, U not 2, I not 4.

Possible permutations:
- U in 1: U _ _ _ S → U _ _ _ S  
  Then I must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be in 4), and we need one more letter in the remaining spot.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FICUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. The best starting words typically include common consonants and a mix of vowels. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"".

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: covers A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll start with ""AROSE"".

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A x → not in the word
- R x → not in the word
- O x → not in the word
- S – → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E x → not in the word

Letters we now KNOW are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E  
Letters we KNOW are in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S

The secret word must contain S somewhere other than position 4, and must contain none of A, R, O, E.

To build a second guess that uses this information and still tests other common letters, I’ll choose a word that:
- includes S but avoids positions 1 and 4 for it (since AROSE already checked 4),
- avoids the eliminated letters,
- introduces new common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S is now in position 1 (new test spot),
- L, U, M, P are all fresh letters that haven’t appeared yet.

This gives maximal new information while respecting previous feedback.

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P  
Letters known TO be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S and U  
(From Guess 1: S is not in position 4; from Guess 2: S is not in position 1, and U is not in position 3.)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and U.
2. Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
3. Places U somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (no A, R, O, E, L, M, P).

Remaining common letters we have not used yet: I, N, T, D, G, H, K, Y, C, B, F, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that fit S and U with these restrictions and common consonants/vowels gives:

“SUITS” – but it repeats S and contains I and T, all allowed.
“SUNNY” – has an N but also a second N and Y, both acceptable.
“SOUND” – contains O and D; O is already eliminated.
“STUNG” – fits: S, T, U, N, G; no eliminated letters.

Let’s choose “STUNG”:
- S placed in position 2 (new spot, not 1 or 4)
- U placed in position 3 (but Guess 2 said U is not in position 3) – oops, invalid.

Next candidate: “SUING”
- S in 1 – already ruled out.

Next: “HUSKS”
- S is in 4 again – ruled out.

Next: “TUNIS”
- S in 5 – allowed, U in 2 – allowed, T, N, I all new and allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P, T, N  
Letters known TO be in the word (with current positional info):
- S — correct in position 5 (✓)
- U — in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- I — in the word, but not in position 4 (-)

Allowed letters left (excluding those already ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed S, U, I.

Structure so far:
- Position 5 is S.
- Positions 2 and 4 cannot be U and I respectively.
- We still need two more letters from the allowed list, one in position 1 and one in position 3, plus placing U and I correctly.

Simplest pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
We must use U and I somewhere in positions 1-4, avoiding:
- U in 2
- I in 4

Let’s list possible placements of U and I:
- U in 1,3,4
- I in 1,2,3

But we still need two additional distinct consonants/vowels at the remaining spots, drawn from the allowed set.

A quick scan of common English words ending in S that contain U and I with the above constraints:

“QUIPS” – Q and P are used; P is ruled out.  
“BUICS” – not a common word.  
“DUKIS” – rare.  
“FUGIS” – rare.  
“HUMPS” – M and P are ruled out.  
“GUSTS” – T is ruled out.  
“CUBIS” – uncommon.  
“WHISK” – K is allowed; but only 4 letters plus s… wait, 5 letters.

Actually, “WHISK” is 5 letters and ends in K, not S, so irrelevant.

Wait, we need a common 5-letter word that:
- ends in S,
- uses U and I,
- U not in 2,
- I not in 4,
- letters only from remaining allowed set.

One good candidate: “GUSSY” – but Y is allowed, and we’d have SS, but that is legal. However it does not contain I.

Next: “QUIDS” – Q and D are allowed; but Q is rare and not yet tested, and D is allowed.  
Check constraints:
- Q U I D S
- U not in 2 – yes, it’s in 2 – violation.  
Discard.

“QUBIS” – not a real word.

“VISCUS” – 6 letters.

“CUBSI” – not valid.

“HUSKS” – K and H are allowed, but we already saw S is fixed in 5, and we need both U and I. “HUSKS” lacks I.

“FUSIL” – ends in L, which is ruled out.

“FUSIL” – invalid.

Try “FUGUS” – G and F allowed, but again lacks I.

Next possible: “WISPS” – contains I and S, but not U.

“WUSIS” – not common.

Let’s step back and build systematically.

We know:
- Position 5 = S
- We must use U and I in positions 1-4, U not 2, I not 4.

Possible permutations:
- U in 1: U _ _ _ S → U _ _ _ S  
  Then I must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be in 4), and we need one more letter in the remaining spot.  
  Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Try “UBICS” – C is allowed. Is “UBICS” a word? No.  
  “UDICS” – no.  
  “UGICS” – no.  
  “UFICS” – no.  
  “UHICS” – no.  
  “UWICS” – no.  
  “UVICS” – no.  
  “UXICS” – no.  
  “UZICS” – no.  
  “UJICS” – no.  
  “UKICS” – no.  
  “UDIKS” – no.  
  None of these are real words.

- U in 3: _ _ U _ S  
  Then I must be in 1, 2.  
  Possible:  
  – I in 1: I _ U _ S  
    filler in position 2 must be from allowed set: C, F, D, etc.  
    “ICUPS” – not a word.  
    “IDUPS” – no.  
    “IFUPS” – no.  
    “IGUPS” – no.  
    “IHUPS” – no.  
    “IVUPS” – no.  
    “IWUPS” – no.  
    “IXUPS” – no.  
    “IYUPS” – no.  
    “IZUPS” – no.  
    “IKUPS” – no.  
  – I in 2: _ I U _ S  
    filler in 1: B, C, D, etc.  
    “BIUYS” – no.  
    “CIUYS” – no.  
    “DIUYS” – no.  
    “FIUYS” – no.  
    “GIUYS” – no.  
    “HIUYS” – no.  
    “VIUYS” – no.  
    “WIUYS” – no.  
    “XIUYS” – no.  
    “YIUYS” – no.  
    “ZIUYS” – no.  

- U in 4: _ _ _ U S  
  Then I must be in 1, 2, 3, not 4 (already), and not 4.  
  Possible:  
  – I in 1: I _ _ U S  
    filler in 2,3: need two allowed consonants.  
    “ICDUS” – no.  
    “IFDUS” – no.  
    “IGDUS” – no.  
    “IHDUS” – no.  
    “IVDUS” – no.  
    “IWDUS” – no.  
    “IXDUS” – no.  
    “IYDUS” – no.  
    “IZDUS” – no.  
  – I in 2: _ I _ U S  
    filler in 1,3:  
    “CIBUS” – C and B allowed; is “CIBUS” a word? No.  
    “DIBUS” – no.  
    “FIBUS” – no.  
    “GIBUS” – no.  
    “HIBUS” – no.  
    “VIBUS” – no.  
  – I in 3: _ _ I U S  
    filler in 1,2:  
    “CDIUS” – no.  
    “CFIUS” – no.  
    “CGIUS” – no.  
    “CHIUS” – no.  
    “CVIUS” – no.  
    “CWIUS” – no.  
    “CYIUS” – no.  
    “CZIUS” – no.  

Real words that fit:
A legitimate word satisfying the constraints is “FUGIS” – but not common.  
Another: “CUBIS” – not common.  
Another: “WUSIS” – not common.  

We might need to accept a less common word, but let’s instead pick a common word that uses the letters we know must be present and the remaining allowed letters.

Real common word: “GUSSY” – doesn’t have I.  
“GUSTS” – lacks I.  
“BUSTS” – lacks I.  
“DUSTS” – lacks I.  
“FASTS” – lacks U and I.  

Actually the only common word that fits is “QUIPS” – but Q and P: P is ruled out.  

Wait, we can use “VISCUS” – 6 letters.  

Real common valid 5-letter word ending in S with U and I, using only allowed letters: “CUSPS” – lacks U.  

Real common word: “DISCUS” – 6 letters.  

Another: “FUSIL” – 5 letters but ends in L, which is ruled out.  

Another: “HUSKS” – lacks I.  

Another: “FUSKS” – no.  

Another: “FUCUS” – 5 letters, ends in S, but contains U and C, but not I.  

Another: “CUSKS” – no.  

Another: “BUMPS” – M and P ruled out.  

Another: “CUPID” – ends in D.  

Another: “CUPID” – not ending in S.  

Another: “VICUS” – 5 letters, ends in S, contains V, I, C, U, S.  
Check constraints:
- V, I, C, U, S  
- S is correct in 5 – yes.  
- U is in 3 – allowed (only forbidden in 2)  
- I is in 2 – allowed (only forbidden in 4)  
- C and V are allowed (not ruled out).  
Real word: “VICUS” – plural of “vicus”, a historical term; it appears in major dictionaries.

Therefore, “VICUS” meets every rule.

Common English 5-letter words ending in ICUS are rare, but a legitimate one is “BICUS” (as in “bicuspid”). All letters are allowed, none have been eliminated.

Thus, the only remaining unknown is the first letter, and “B” is a reasonable, common choice.

- AROSE: covers A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Therefore, I'll start with ""AROSE"".

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A x → not in the word
- R x → not in the word
- O x → not in the word
- S – → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E x → not in the word

Letters we now KNOW are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E  
Letters we KNOW are in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S

The secret word must contain S somewhere other than position 4, and must contain none of A, R, O, E.

To build a second guess that uses this information and still tests other common letters, I’ll choose a word that:
- includes S but avoids positions 1 and 4 for it (since AROSE already checked 4),
- avoids the eliminated letters,
- introduces new common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S is now in position 1 (new test spot),
- L, U, M, P are all fresh letters that haven’t appeared yet.

This gives maximal new information while respecting previous feedback.

Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) U(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate what we now know.

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P  
Letters known TO be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S and U  
(From Guess 1: S is not in position 4; from Guess 2: S is not in position 1, and U is not in position 3.)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and U.
2. Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
3. Places U somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set (no A, R, O, E, L, M, P).

Remaining common letters we have not used yet: I, N, T, D, G, H, K, Y, C, B, F, V, W, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that fit S and U with these restrictions and common consonants/vowels gives:

“SUITS” – but it repeats S and contains I and T, all allowed.
“SUNNY” – has an N but also a second N and Y, both acceptable.
“SOUND” – contains O and D; O is already eliminated.
“STUNG” – fits: S, T, U, N, G; no eliminated letters.

Let’s choose “STUNG”:
- S placed in position 2 (new spot, not 1 or 4)
- U placed in position 3 (but Guess 2 said U is not in position 3) – oops, invalid.

Next candidate: “SUING”
- S in 1 – already ruled out.

Next: “HUSKS”
- S is in 4 again – ruled out.

Next: “TUNIS”
- S in 5 – allowed, U in 2 – allowed, T, N, I all new and allowed.

That looks safe.

<guess>TUNIS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: TUNIS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(-) N(x) I(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, M, P, T, N  
Letters known TO be in the word (with current positional info):
- S — correct in position 5 (✓)
- U — in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- I — in the word, but not in position 4 (-)

Allowed letters left (excluding those already ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed S, U, I.

Structure so far:
- Position 5 is S.
- Positions 2 and 4 cannot be U and I respectively.
- We still need two more letters from the allowed list, one in position 1 and one in position 3, plus placing U and I correctly.

Simplest pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
We must use U and I somewhere in positions 1-4, avoiding:
- U in 2
- I in 4

Let’s list possible placements of U and I:
- U in 1,3,4
- I in 1,2,3

But we still need two additional distinct consonants/vowels at the remaining spots, drawn from the allowed set.

A quick scan of common English words ending in S that contain U and I with the above constraints:

“QUIPS” – Q and P are used; P is ruled out.  
“BUICS” – not a common word.  
“DUKIS” – rare.  
“FUGIS” – rare.  
“HUMPS” – M and P are ruled out.  
“GUSTS” – T is ruled out.  
“CUBIS” – uncommon.  
“WHISK” – K is allowed; but only 4 letters plus s… wait, 5 letters.

Actually, “WHISK” is 5 letters and ends in K, not S, so irrelevant.

Wait, we need a common 5-letter word that:
- ends in S,
- uses U and I,
- U not in 2,
- I not in 4,
- letters only from remaining allowed set.

One good candidate: “GUSSY” – but Y is allowed, and we’d have SS, but that is legal. However it does not contain I.

Next: “QUIDS” – Q and D are allowed; but Q is rare and not yet tested, and D is allowed.  
Check constraints:
- Q U I D S
- U not in 2 – yes, it’s in 2 – violation.  
Discard.

“QUBIS” – not a real word.

“VISCUS” – 6 letters.

“CUBSI” – not valid.

“HUSKS” – K and H are allowed, but we already saw S is fixed in 5, and we need both U and I. “HUSKS” lacks I.

“FUSIL” – ends in L, which is ruled out.

“FUSIL” – invalid.

Try “FUGUS” – G and F allowed, but again lacks I.

Next possible: “WISPS” – contains I and S, but not U.

“WUSIS” – not common.

Let’s step back and build systematically.

We know:
- Position 5 = S
- We must use U and I in positions 1-4, U not 2, I not 4.

Possible permutations:
- U in 1: U _ _ _ S → U _ _ _ S  
  Then I must be in 2 or 3 (cannot be in 4), and we need one more letter in the remaining spot.  
  Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Try “UBICS” – C is allowed. Is “UBICS” a word? No.  
  “UDICS” – no.  
  “UGICS” – no.  
  “UFICS” – no.  
  “UHICS” – no.  
  “UWICS” – no.  
  “UVICS” – no.  
  “UXICS” – no.  
  “UZICS” – no.  
  “UJICS” – no.  
  “UKICS” – no.  
  “UDIKS” – no.  
  None of these are real words.

- U in 3: _ _ U _ S  
  Then I must be in 1, 2.  
  Possible:  
  – I in 1: I _ U _ S  
    filler in position 2 must be from allowed set: C, F, D, etc.  
    “ICUPS” – not a word.  
    “IDUPS” – no.  
    “IFUPS” – no.  
    “IGUPS” – no.  
    “IHUPS” – no.  
    “IVUPS” – no.  
    “IWUPS” – no.  
    “IXUPS” – no.  
    “IYUPS” – no.  
    “IZUPS” – no.  
    “IKUPS” – no.  
  – I in 2: _ I U _ S  
    filler in 1: B, C, D, etc.  
    “BIUYS” – no.  
    “CIUYS” – no.  
    “DIUYS” – no.  
    “FIUYS” – no.  
    “GIUYS” – no.  
    “HIUYS” – no.  
    “VIUYS” – no.  
    “WIUYS” – no.  
    “XIUYS” – no.  
    “YIUYS” – no.  
    “ZIUYS” – no.  

- U in 4: _ _ _ U S  
  Then I must be in 1, 2, 3, not 4 (already), and not 4.  
  Possible:  
  – I in 1: I _ _ U S  
    filler in 2,3: need two allowed consonants.  
    “ICDUS” – no.  
    “IFDUS” – no.  
    “IGDUS” – no.  
    “IHDUS” – no.  
    “IVDUS” – no.  
    “IWDUS” – no.  
    “IXDUS” – no.  
    “IYDUS” – no.  
    “IZDUS” – no.  
  – I in 2: _ I _ U S  
    filler in 1,3:  
    “CIBUS” – C and B allowed; is “CIBUS” a word? No.  
    “DIBUS” – no.  
    “FIBUS” – no.  
    “GIBUS” – no.  
    “HIBUS” – no.  
    “VIBUS” – no.  
  – I in 3: _ _ I U S  
    filler in 1,2:  
    “CDIUS” – no.  
    “CFIUS” – no.  
    “CGIUS” – no.  
    “CHIUS” – no.  
    “CVIUS” – no.  
    “CWIUS” – no.  
    “CYIUS” – no.  
    “CZIUS” – no.  

Real words that fit:
A legitimate word satisfying the constraints is “FUGIS” – but not common.  
Another: “CUBIS” – not common.  
Another: “WUSIS” – not common.  

We might need to accept a less common word, but let’s instead pick a common word that uses the letters we know must be present and the remaining allowed letters.

Real common word: “GUSSY” – doesn’t have I.  
“GUSTS” – lacks I.  
“BUSTS” – lacks I.  
“DUSTS” – lacks I.  
“FASTS” – lacks U and I.  

Actually the only common word that fits is “QUIPS” – but Q and P: P is ruled out.  

Wait, we can use “VISCUS” – 6 letters.  

Real common valid 5-letter word ending in S with U and I, using only allowed letters: “CUSPS” – lacks U.  

Real common word: “DISCUS” – 6 letters.  

Another: “FUSIL” – 5 letters but ends in L, which is ruled out.  

Another: “HUSKS” – lacks I.  

Another: “FUSKS” – no.  

Another: “FUCUS” – 5 letters, ends in S, but contains U and C, but not I.  

Another: “CUSKS” – no.  

Another: “BUMPS” – M and P ruled out.  

Another: “CUPID” – ends in D.  

Another: “CUPID” – not ending in S.  

Another: “VICUS” – 5 letters, ends in S, contains V, I, C, U, S.  
Check constraints:
- V, I, C, U, S  
- S is correct in 5 – yes.  
- U is in 3 – allowed (only forbidden in 2)  
- I is in 2 – allowed (only forbidden in 4)  
- C and V are allowed (not ruled out).  
Real word: “VICUS” – plural of “vicus”, a historical term; it appears in major dictionaries.

Therefore, “VICUS” meets every rule.

From Guess 5 we now know that the only remaining unknown is the first letter; the last four letters are locked in as I-C-U-S.  
Letters already ruled out for the first position include: A, B, R, O, E, L, M, P, T, N, V.  
Allowed first letters left (common ones): D, F, G, H, K.  
A quick check of real 5-letter English words ending in ICUS yields “DICUS” (a rare spelling variant of “dice”), “FICUS” (the plant genus), “HICUS” (obsolete), and “KICUS” (non-word).  
Among these, “FICUS” is the standard dictionary entry and uses only still-allowed letters.

Therefore “FICUS” is the correct final guess.
