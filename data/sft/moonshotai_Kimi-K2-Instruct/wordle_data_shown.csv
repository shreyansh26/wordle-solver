For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently used letters that appear in many 5-letter words, helping us quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Summary of all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   – Word form S _ _ _ _
   – Forbidden: L, A, T, E

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   – O is in the word, but not in position 2
   – U is not in the word
   – N is in the word, but not in position 4
   – D is not in the word

3. SPORN → S(✓) P(x) O(✓) R(x) N(✓)
   – O is now confirmed in position 3
   – N is confirmed in position 5
   – P and R are not in the word

Current constraints:
- Fixed letters: S _ O _ N
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, U, D, P, R
- Remaining possible letters (for positions 2 and 4): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common English 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ N with the allowed letters:
- SCONE (S C O N E) – but E is forbidden
- SWORN – R is forbidden
- SHOWN – H W O N; W and H are allowed
- SCORN – R is forbidden
- STONE – T is forbidden
- SOON – too short
- SKOEN – not a standard English word

The best and only common English word that appears to fit is SHOWN:
- S H O W N
- H and W are allowed
- Matches all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is SHOWN.
