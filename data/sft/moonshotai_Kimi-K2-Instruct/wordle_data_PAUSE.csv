To make the first guess in a Wordle game, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should cover different letters that frequently appear in English 5-letter words. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, L, T), providing a good mix to test for letters in the secret word.

Let me summarize what we now know after the two guesses:

Known facts:
- E must be in position 5 (from SLATE feedback).
- A must be in position 2 (from SANER feedback).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from both SLATE and SANER).
- L, T, N, R are NOT in the word at all.
- The pattern so far is: _ A _ _ E

Letters we have NOT tried yet (and are still possible): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it's not 1 or 2, and 5 is E).

Possible positions for S: 3 or 4.

Therefore the word must fit one of these patterns:
- _ A S _ E
- _ A _ S E

Now let's think of common 5-letter words ending in E with A in position 2 and S in either 3 or 4.

For _ A S _ E:
- BASES (but S already used in position 3, and we can’t have double S)
- CASKS (invalid, K and S already used)
- MASSE (invalid, double S)
- PASSE (invalid, double S)

For _ A _ S E:
- CASES (invalid, double S)
- CHASE (C, H not used yet)
- PHASE (P, H not used yet)
- VASES (invalid, double S)
- MASSE (invalid, double S)

""CHASE"" seems good - uses C and H which are new letters, fits _ A _ S E pattern, and S is in position 4 which is allowed.

Alternatively, ""PHASE"" - but P-H-A-S-E has P and H new. Between these, CHASE might be more common.

Let me update the constraints after the three guesses.

Known facts so far:

- Position 5 = E (✓)  
- Position 4 = S (✓)  
- Position 2 = A (from SANER), but CHASE says A(-) … conflict?

Wait, re-read carefully:

Guess 2: SANER → A(✓) means A is in position 2.

Guess 3: CHASE → A(-) means A is NOT in position 3 (which we already knew), but it does NOT contradict that A is in position 2. So we still have:

Pattern: _ A _ S E

Letters known absent: C, H, L, N, R, T

S is now fixed in position 4, E in 5, A in 2.

So far: _ A _ S E

Letters left to try: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

We need a letter for positions 1 and 3. Position 3 must be a letter that has not been ruled out. Let’s list some possible words:

- B A S E S → invalid (double S)
- B A I S E → no such word
- B A M S E → no such word
- V A S E S → invalid (double S)
- G A S E S → invalid (double S)
- P A S S E → invalid (double S)
- D A I S E → no
- F A K E S → invalid (S not in 4)  
- G A M E S → S is in 4, E is in 5, A is in 2 → G A M E S → fits G A M E S → matches pattern _ A _ S E

But wait, G A M E S is spelled G-A-M-E-S, so positions: 1=G, 2=A, 3=M, 4=E, 5=S → but we need 4=S, 5=E. So G A M E S has S in 5, not 4. So it doesn't fit.

Correct pattern: _ A _ S E

So the word must be of the form X A Y S E where X and Y are letters not yet excluded.

Some candidates:
- P A S S E → invalid (double S)
- B A S S E → invalid
- F A K S E → no
- P A I S E → no
- V A I S E → no
- D A I S E → no
- M A I S E → no
- B A I S E → no
- M A S S E → invalid
- P A R S E → R is excluded
- P A U S E → P, A, U, S, E → fits _ A _ S E: P A U S E → positions 1=P, 2=A, 3=U, 4=S, 5=E → perfect.

Letters used: P, A, U, S, E  
Only new letter is U. All constraints satisfied.

Another check: is ""PAUSE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So:
Pattern: _ A _ S E → P A U S E

All constraints:
- Pos 1: P (new, allowed)
- Pos 2: A (correct)
- Pos 3: U (new, allowed)
- Pos 4: S (correct)
- Pos 5: E (correct)

No conflicts.
