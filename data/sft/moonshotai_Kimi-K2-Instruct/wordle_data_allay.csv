For the first guess, we want a word that will give us maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. A good choice would be a word that contains:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like T, N, S, R, L

One of the best starting words according to word game analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us the best chance to identify multiple letters in the first guess.

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A(✓) : Correct letter in the correct 1st position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) : These four letters are not in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word starts with ‘A’ and does not contain R, O, S, or E.  

Next, we want to test several new, common letters while keeping the first letter as A. Good consonants we haven’t tried yet include T, N, L, C; good vowels still to test include I and U.  
A balanced word that keeps A in place and introduces new high-frequency letters is “AINT” plus one more consonant. A valid five-letter word meeting these criteria is “AINTS”.

Actually, “AINTS” is not valid (plural of “ain’t” is not standard).  
Another valid option is “ANVIL”, which reuses A, adds N, V, I, L.  
But we still want to keep it simple and avoid duplicate vowels until we know more.  

A better choice: “AULIC” (uses A, U, L, I, C). Still, this is fairly uncommon.  
A more common word: “ALMUD” (archaic).  

The most straightforward common word that uses fresh letters and keeps A first is “ALONG” – but O is already out.  

Let’s settle on “ANVIL” – it uses A confirmed, plus N, V, I, L.

Actually, “ANVIL” is good but does not place A first. We must keep A in position 1.

Most common word starting with A, avoiding R, O, S, E: “ALONE” – but O and E are excluded.  

Next, “ALIEN” – E excluded.  

“ACRID” – R excluded.  

“ACUTE” – E excluded.  

“ACHID” – not a word.  

“AGING” – G is acceptable and common.  

But we want fresh consonants: T, N, L are strong.  

A valid word with A first and new letters: “ANTIC”.

This uses A fixed at position 1, and introduces N, T, I, C. None of N, T, I, C have been ruled out yet.

So our next guess is “ANTIC”.

From the two guesses we have the following locked-in information:

1. Position 1 is **A** (✓ in both guesses).
2. The letters **R, O, S, E, N, T, I, C** are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern:
A _ _ _ _
and the remaining four letters must be chosen only from the alphabet **excluding** the eight letters above.

Letters still available (common ones):
B D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with **A**, uses none of the excluded letters, and includes as many of the still-available common consonants as possible to gain maximum new information.

One of the most frequent consonants we haven’t tried yet is **L**, and another good candidate is **D** or **M**.  
Looking for common English words that fit:

- ABACK – contains C (excluded)
- ABAFT – contains T (excluded)
- ABAND – contains N (excluded)
- ABAJA – not a word
- ABUZZ – contains Z, U, Z (valid letters: U not yet excluded, but Z is rare)
- ABBED – contains B
- ABBOT – contains O (excluded)
- AMBLE – contains M, B, L, E (E excluded)
- AMPLE – contains P, L, E (E excluded)
- ABLED – contains B, L, D, E (E excluded)
- APHID – contains H, D (valid letters)

**APHID** uses:
- A (known correct at start)
- P, H, I, D  
But **I** has already been excluded (from ANTIC feedback: I(x)).

So **APHID** is invalid because **I** is not allowed.

Next candidate: **ABUZZ** – uses A, B, U, Z, Z  
All letters are allowed (B, U, Z not excluded).

Another candidate: **ABLED** – uses A, B, L, E, D  
But **E** is excluded.

**ABUZZ** seems to be the only common word left that fits the constraints.

However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word that tests **L, D, M, B** or similar.  
Looking further:

- **ALKYD** – uses A, L, K, Y, D  
All letters are allowed (L, K, Y, D not excluded). This is a valid chemical term.

- **ALBUM** – uses A, L, B, U, M  
Also valid and common. All letters are allowed.

Between **ALKYD** and **ALBUM**, **ALBUM** is more common and tests four new consonants (L, B, U, M), none of which have been excluded.

A balanced word that keeps A in place and introduces new high-frequency letters is “AINT” plus one more consonant. A valid five-letter word meeting these criteria is “AINTS”.

Actually, “AINTS” is not valid (plural of “ain’t” is not standard).  
Another valid option is “ANVIL”, which reuses A, adds N, V, I, L.  
But we still want to keep it simple and avoid duplicate vowels until we know more.  

A better choice: “AULIC” (uses A, U, L, I, C). Still, this is fairly uncommon.  
A more common word: “ALMUD” (archaic).  

The most straightforward common word that uses fresh letters and keeps A first is “ALONG” – but O is already out.  

Let’s settle on “ANVIL” – it uses A confirmed, plus N, V, I, L.

Actually, “ANVIL” is good but does not place A first. We must keep A in position 1.

Most common word starting with A, avoiding R, O, S, E: “ALONE” – but O and E are excluded.  

Next, “ALIEN” – E excluded.  

“ACRID” – R excluded.  

“ACUTE” – E excluded.  

“ACHID” – not a word.  

“AGING” – G is acceptable and common.  

But we want fresh consonants: T, N, L are strong.  

A valid word with A first and new letters: “ANTIC”.

This uses A fixed at position 1, and introduces N, T, I, C. None of N, T, I, C have been ruled out yet.

So our next guess is “ANTIC”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have the following locked-in information:

1. Position 1 is **A** (✓ in both guesses).
2. The letters **R, O, S, E, N, T, I, C** are **not** in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern:
A _ _ _ _
and the remaining four letters must be chosen only from the alphabet **excluding** the eight letters above.

Letters still available (common ones):
B D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with **A**, uses none of the excluded letters, and includes as many of the still-available common consonants as possible to gain maximum new information.

One of the most frequent consonants we haven’t tried yet is **L**, and another good candidate is **D** or **M**.  
Looking for common English words that fit:

- ABACK – contains C (excluded)
- ABAFT – contains T (excluded)
- ABAND – contains N (excluded)
- ABAJA – not a word
- ABUZZ – contains Z, U, Z (valid letters: U not yet excluded, but Z is rare)
- ABBED – contains B
- ABBOT – contains O (excluded)
- AMBLE – contains M, B, L, E (E excluded)
- AMPLE – contains P, L, E (E excluded)
- ABLED – contains B, L, D, E (E excluded)
- APHID – contains H, D (valid letters)

**APHID** uses:
- A (known correct at start)
- P, H, I, D  
But **I** has already been excluded (from ANTIC feedback: I(x)).

So **APHID** is invalid because **I** is not allowed.

Next candidate: **ABUZZ** – uses A, B, U, Z, Z  
All letters are allowed (B, U, Z not excluded).

Another candidate: **ABLED** – uses A, B, L, E, D  
But **E** is excluded.

**ABUZZ** seems to be the only common word left that fits the constraints.

However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word that tests **L, D, M, B** or similar.  
Looking further:

- **ALKYD** – uses A, L, K, Y, D  
All letters are allowed (L, K, Y, D not excluded). This is a valid chemical term.

- **ALBUM** – uses A, L, B, U, M  
Also valid and common. All letters are allowed.

Between **ALKYD** and **ALBUM**, **ALBUM** is more common and tests four new consonants (L, B, U, M), none of which have been excluded.

Therefore, **ALBUM** is the optimal next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Good consonants we haven’t tried yet include T, N, L, C; good vowels still to test include I and U.  \nA balanced word that keeps A in place and introduces new high-frequency letters is “AINT” plus one more consonant. A valid five-letter word meeting these criteria is “AINTS”.\n\nActually, “AINTS” is not valid (plural of “ain’t” is not standard).  \nAnother valid option is “ANVIL”, which reuses A, adds N, V, I, L.  \nBut we still want to keep it simple and avoid duplicate vowels until we know more.  \n\nA better choice: “AULIC” (uses A, U, L, I, C). Still, this is fairly uncommon.  \nA more common word: “ALMUD” (archaic).  \n\nThe most straightforward common word that uses fresh letters and keeps A first is “ALONG” – but O is already out.  \n\nLet’s settle on “ANVIL” – it uses A confirmed, plus N, V, I, L.\n\nActually, “ANVIL” is good but does not place A first.

Confirmed so far:
- A ✓ at position 1
- L ✓ at position 2
- Y is in the word (but not in position 4)

Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, N, T, I, C, B, U, M, K, D

Pattern we now have:
A L _ _ _
and one of the last three letters is Y, but NOT in position 4.

So Y must be in position 3 or 5.

Letters still allowed (besides Y): F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a common 5-letter word beginning AL, with Y in position 3 or 5, and using only the allowed letters in the other two slots.

Position 3 = Y: A L Y _ _
   - ALY??  →  No common 5-letter words start ALY.

Position 5 = Y: A L _ _ Y
   - A L F F Y → not a word
   - A L G G Y → not a word
   - A L P P Y → not a word
   - A L H H Y → not a word
   - A L G Y at 3 is invalid.

Wait, let’s list real dictionary words:
- ALLAY – repeats L, has A again (but A already used once, allowed to repeat), but two L’s and an A repeat. We have no ban on repeats, only on the listed forbidden letters. However, ALLAY uses only A, L, Y, none of which are forbidden. So ALLAY fits AL _ _ _ with Y at 5.

Another candidate: ALLOY – but O is forbidden.

ALWAY – would be ALWAY, but that uses A again and W.

Actually, the word **ALLAY** is a valid English 5-letter word: A L L A Y.
- A ✓, L ✓, L, A, Y(-) fits the new feedback.
- Letters used: A, L, Y – all allowed; no forbidden letters.

So ALLAY is a valid next guess.

But we already know positions 1 and 2 are correct. We need to test Y in position 5 and two new consonants. Instead of ALLAY (which has a second L and a second A), try **ALWAY**? That is also a valid variant of ALWAYS.

But ALWAY is 5 letters: A L W A Y.

Both ALLAY and ALWAY fit. However, we want to maximize new letter tests. Between them, **ALWAY** introduces W, Y in position 5, and repeats A (allowed).

But **ALLY** is 4 letters, so **ALLAY** (double L, double A) is actually common.

Yet we already know positions 1 and 2, so we only need to fill 3 letters. We need a word like AL_ _ Y with no forbidden letters.

A better common word: **ALPAY** – no, not a word.

Actually, there is a very common word **ALLAY**.

So the most straightforward valid word under constraints is ALLAY. But since we already have positions 1 and 2, the important part is to test Y in position 5 and two new consonants in positions 3 and 4. We can avoid double letters.

Let’s try **ALFAY**? Not a word.

**ALPAY**? Not.

**ALWAY** is the only common 5-letter word fitting A L _ _ Y and using allowed letters: A, L, W, A, Y.

So **ALWAY**.

But **ALWAY** is a variant spelling; the everyday word **ALLOY** has O (forbidden).

Realizing: the only common word left starting AL and ending Y is **ALLAY**.

Thus, we go with **ALLAY**.
