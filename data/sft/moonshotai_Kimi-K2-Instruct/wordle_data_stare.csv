For the first guess, the best approach is to choose a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most frequent in English. A good first word should use as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters.

From the feedback:
- S ✓ : S is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- L x : L is not in the word at all.
- A ✓ : A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- T - : T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E ✓ : E is in the correct 5th position.

So the word structure so far is S _ A _ E, with T somewhere in the remaining blanks (position 2 or 4, but not 4, so position 2).

The word so far is S T A _ E (since T must be in position 2). The remaining letter must be a consonant not yet used (no L) and fit into position 4.

A common word fitting this pattern is STARE (but R hasn't been tested yet), or STAGE (G hasn't been tested), or STATE (but T is already in position 2). Given the letters used so far (S, A, T, E), and avoiding L, possible letters for position 4 are R, G, etc.

The most likely word here is STARE, as R is common in this position.
