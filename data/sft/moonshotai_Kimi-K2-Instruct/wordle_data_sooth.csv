For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. The best starting words in Wordle typically contain common consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'm going to choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English words)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

We just learned that **none** of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear in the secret word at all.  
So we need a 5-letter word that uses completely different letters.  
A good second guess should still use common English letters to maximize information gain, while avoiding C-R-A-N-E.

Consonants left that are very common: S, T, L, D, B, M, P, F, H, G, K  
Vowels left: I, O, U, Y

I’ll pick a word that mixes several of these.  
Popular choices here are often:

- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T) – but U is a less-common vowel.  
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – uses U and P.

From the two pieces of feedback:

- CRANE → C R A N E are all absent.  
- STOMP →  
  – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
  – T is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 2).  
  – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  – M and P are absent.

So we now know:

- Word starts with S and has O in the 3rd spot: S _ O _ _  
- T is somewhere in the word but NOT in the 2nd spot.  
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, M, P.

Remaining consonants that are common and still available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern S _ O _ _ that also contains T somewhere (not in position 2).  
Possible positions for T: 2, 4, or 5.  Position 2 is allowed because T is “wrong position” in STOMP, meaning it isn’t position 2 in the secret word.

Let’s try constructing candidate words:

- S B O T _  → SBOT_ – SBOTY?  Not valid.  
- S H O T _  → SHOT_ – SHOTI?  Not valid.  SHOTU?  Not valid.  
- S W O T _  → SWOT_ – SWOTH?  Not valid.  
- S _ O T _  – need letter in 2 and 5.  
- S _ O _ T – T in 5th spot.

Let’s list valid words that fit S _ O _ _ and contain T:

- S O U T H – But O is 3rd not 2nd, and SOUTH doesn’t fit S _ O _ _ pattern.  
- S L O T H – Fits: S L O T H.  Let’s check letters: S (correct pos 1 ✓), L (new), O (pos 3 ✓), T (pos 4; originally T was pos 2 in STOMP, so pos 4 is allowed), H (new).  All letters are valid and none are excluded yet.

Other possibilities:

- S P O T S – P already excluded.

From the new feedback on SLOTH:

- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.  
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.  
- T(✓) – T is correct in position 4.  
- H(✓) – H is correct in position 5.

That only leaves position 2 to determine.  
We know the pattern is: S _ O T H (where _ is the unknown letter).

Letters already used or ruled out:
- Used successfully: S, O, T, H
- Ruled out from earlier guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, P, L

Letters still allowed for position 2: B, D, F, G, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The only common English word that fits S _ O T H is “SOOTH” (but the second O would duplicate the third O and “SOOTH” uses O twice; it’s also archaic).  
Another possible word is “SMITH”, but M is already ruled out.  
“SWITH” isn’t a common word.  

The only standard modern 5-letter word that fits S _ O T H is:

- S P O T H – P is ruled out.  
- S B O T H – Not a valid word.  
- S D O T H – Not valid.  
- S G O T H – Not valid.  
- S F O T H – Not valid.  
- S V O T H – Not valid.  
- S W O T H – Not valid.  
- S K O T H – Not valid.  
- S Y O T H – Not valid.  
- S I O T H – Not valid.  
- S U O T H – Not valid (and O already used).

Wait — actually “SOOTH” is the only real candidate, but it’s obscure and repeats O.  
Rechecking standard dictionaries, the common word that fits is “SMITH”, but M is excluded.  
“SWATH” would require A, which is excluded.  
“SLASH” – L and A excluded.  

It appears the only valid word left is:

“SOOTH” (even though it’s less common).

But since O is already fixed in position 3, and we cannot reuse it in position 2, “SOOTH” is invalid (and also uses O twice).

Re-evaluating: what other 5-letter word fits S _ O T H and uses only allowed letters?

Upon reflection, the only valid common word is “SMITH”, but M is excluded.  
After careful consideration, the only remaining possibility is:

“SOUTH” – However, this is S O U T H, which would place O in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3.  

Wait — the feedback shows position 3 as O (correct), and position 4 as T (correct), position 5 as H (correct).  
So word is S _ O T H.

The only valid word is actually “SOOTH” (even though it’s archaic).  

But wait — “S _ O T H” with O already in position 3: the second letter must be a consonant and we’ve ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, M, P, L.  

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid word fitting S [consonant] O T H is:

- “SKOTH” – Not valid.  
- “SWOTH” – Not valid.  
- “SBOTH” – Not valid.  
- “SGOTH” – Not valid.  

This suggests I missed a candidate.  

Looking back, the only real word is “SOOTH”, but it duplicates O.  
Upon deeper inspection, the actual valid word fitting S _ O T H is “SOOTH” despite the repeat O, because “SOOTH” is an archaic word meaning “truth”.  

Given the constraints, “SOOTH” is the only possible word left.

Therefore, the word must be “SOOTH”.

The feedback from SLOTH confirms the final four letters: S, O, T, H are locked into positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
