For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
4. Avoids letters that are very rare (like Q, X, Z) initially

Some popular and strategic first guesses include words like:
- STARE (contains common letters S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should help reveal information about multiple potentially correct letters early in the game.

From the new feedback on POINT:

- P(✓) – the letter P is correct and is in the first position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in the fifth position (confirmed again).

So the word starts with P and definitely contains T somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Letters ruled out so far:
S, A, R, E, O, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y.

Need a 5-letter word beginning with P, containing T, avoiding S, A, R, E, O, I, N.

Possible patterns:
P _ T _ _
P _ _ T _
P _ _ _ T (but T was already ruled out for position 5)
P T _ _ _

Let me brainstorm words:
- POUTY – ruled out (O, U, Y may be okay, but O is ruled out)
- PITHY – ruled out (I is out)
- PARTY – ruled out (A, R are out)
- PUDGY – no T
- PATTY – A is out
- PUTTY – U, T, T, Y – possible, but has two Ts and U/Y are still allowed
- PLUMY – no T
- PLYER – R is out
- CRYPT – C, R, Y, P, T – R is out
- PUBIC – I, C – I is out
- PUDGY – no T
- PULPY – no T
- PUPPY – no T

Let me think more systematically. The word is P _ _ _ _, must contain T (positions 2, 3, or 4), and no S, A, R, E, O, I, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, T.

Let’s list valid combinations:
- P L U T _ – but we need 5 letters, and T is in position 4.
- P L U T _ – PLUT_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- P U T T Y – PUTTY. This is valid: P, U, T, T, Y. Contains T in position 3 and 4, no forbidden letters.
- P U L T _ – no valid word.
- P U M P T – no valid word.
- P U F F Y – no T.
- P U G G Y – no T.
- P U L S Y – S is out.
- P U B L T – no valid word.

PUTTY seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints:
- Starts with P.
- Contains T in positions 3 and 4 (acceptable since feedback only said T is not in position 5 and not in position 2 from STARE).
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, R, E, O, I, N).
- Uses remaining allowed letters (U, T, Y).

However, the feedback from STARE already indicated T is not in position 2 (STARE had T in position 2 and got (-)), so T could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But from POINT, T is not in position 5, so T must be in 1, 3, or 4. Since position 1 is P, T must be in 3 or 4.

PUTTY has T in positions 3 and 4, which is allowed.

Another candidate is P U L T _ – but no valid word.
Another is P L U T _ – PLUT_ not a word.
P U M P T – not a word.
P U F F Y – no T.
