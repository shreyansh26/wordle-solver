- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has commonly used letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. English words often contain vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should provide helpful feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the first feedback:

O(-) – O is somewhere in the word but not in position 3  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all

Letters eliminated so far: A, R, S, E  
We know O is somewhere in the word, but not at position 3.  
We still know nothing about the other four positions.

Next, I want to introduce new common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and vowels (I, U) while avoiding the eliminated letters.  
A common, information-dense word that uses fresh letters is “POINT”:

P – new consonant  
O – known vowel (not at position 3)  
I – new vowel  
N – new consonant  
T – new consonant  

“POINT” gives us five fresh letters to test and positions the known O in a different spot (position 2 rather than 3).

Current deductions:

1. Eliminated letters (not in the word): A, R, S, E, P, T
2. O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
3. I is in the word AND is in position 3.
4. N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far the partial pattern looks like:
_ _ I _ _

and we know O and N must appear somewhere in the remaining slots.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(but we also know N and O are definitely present).

We need to place O and N in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 while keeping I fixed at position 3.

A simple next move: try a word that uses the known letters O, I, N in different positions to confirm where O and N belong. A good candidate is “COBIA” – but we already know A is out and we haven’t confirmed B yet. Instead, let’s try “UNION”:

- U: new vowel
- N: must be somewhere (and not in position 4)
- I: already fixed at position 3
- O: must be somewhere (and not in position 3)
- N: repeated N is allowed and helps place it somewhere other than position 4.

UNION tests:  
U in position 1 (new),  
N in position 2 (possible),  
I in position 3 (known),  
O in position 4 (possible, since O only forbidden from position 3),  
N in position 5 (possible).  

This will quickly tell us where O and N can go.
