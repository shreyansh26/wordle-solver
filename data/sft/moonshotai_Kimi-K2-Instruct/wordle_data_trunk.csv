For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should use letters that frequently appear in English words and ideally include some vowels and common consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify which of these frequent letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
1. Still contains R but NOT in the first position.
2. Contains none of A, I, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.  
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A, I, E are out).

A balanced word that meets these criteria is ROUND:
- R is in position 1 (but we just learned R isn’t in position 1), so I’ll move R elsewhere.  
Instead, let’s try a word where R is NOT first: CRUST has C, R (second spot), U, S (but S is already ruled out), T – but S is disallowed.  
Better choice: FRONT – but F isn’t common.  
Best balanced word left: TROOP – but two O’s may waste info.

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (because in ROUND it also got “-” in position 1).

2. ROUND → R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)  
   - R is still not in position 1 or 2, so possible spots now: 3, 4  
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)  
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)  
   - O and D are not in the word

So the structure we know so far:
_ _ U N _

Letters we know are in the word: R, U, N  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, S, E, O, D

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Has U in position 3  
- Has N in position 4  
- Has R somewhere (positions 3 and 4 already taken, so R must be in position 5)  
- No A, I, S, E, O, D

Thus the pattern is _ _ U N R.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending in “UNR” that fit:  
TUNNR – invalid (double N)  
BUNNR – invalid  
FUNNY – has F, ends in NY, not “UNR”  
RUNNY – has R but starts with R, which we ruled out  
PUNYR – invalid  
BUNYR – invalid  
GUNYR – invalid  

The only valid word I can think of with the pattern _ _ U N R is “HUNGR” – but that’s 6 letters.  
Next, check if any 5-letter words fit this pattern. Realizing now there are no standard 5-letter English words with the exact form __UNR. This suggests we might have made an error in assuming R must be in position 5.

Wait – we know R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ROUND). So R must be in position 3 or 4. However, positions 3 and 4 are already taken by U and N respectively. This is a contradiction – meaning our assumption that R must be in position 5 is wrong.

Re-evaluating: R got “-” in both RAISE (position 1) and ROUND (position 1), but we have no info about positions 3, 4, or 5 for R. So R could still be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

But we know:
- U is in position 3 (from ROUND)
- N is in position 4 (from ROUND)

Thus R must be in position 5. But no 5-letter word ends with “UNR” – so this suggests our interpretation might be missing something.

Wait – the feedback “R(-)” in ROUND means R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (same as in RAISE). So positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are still open for R. We know:
- U is in position 3 (correct spot)
- N is in position 4 (correct spot)

So the word has the form _ _ U N _, and R must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- B R U N _ – but we’d need a 5th letter. BRUNG is 6 letters.
- _ _ U N R – again, no 5-letter word like “BUNNR” etc.

Realizing this, the only plausible 5-letter word I can think of is “BRUNT”:
B, R, U, N, T. Let’s check:
- B: new letter
- R: in position 2 (allowed)
- U: position 3 (correct)
- N: position 4 (correct)
- T: new letter
No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, O, D).

“BRUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “the edge or ridge of a hill; a sharp blow.”

- No A, I, S, E, O, D

Thus the pattern is _ _ U N R.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending in “UNR” that fit:  
TUNNR – invalid (double N)  
BUNNR – invalid  
FUNNY – has F, ends in NY, not “UNR”  
RUNNY – has R but starts with R, which we ruled out  
PUNYR – invalid  
BUNYR – invalid  
GUNYR – invalid  

The only valid word I can think of with the pattern _ _ U N R is “HUNGR” – but that’s 6 letters.  
Next, check if any 5-letter words fit this pattern. Realizing now there are no standard 5-letter English words with the exact form __UNR. This suggests we might have made an error in assuming R must be in position 5.

Wait – we know R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ROUND). So R must be in position 3 or 4. However, positions 3 and 4 are already taken by U and N respectively. This is a contradiction – meaning our assumption that R must be in position 5 is wrong.

Re-evaluating: R got “-” in both RAISE (position 1) and ROUND (position 1), but we have no info about positions 3, 4, or 5 for R. So R could still be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

But we know:
- U is in position 3 (from ROUND)
- N is in position 4 (from ROUND)

Thus R must be in position 5. But no 5-letter word ends with “UNR” – so this suggests our interpretation might be missing something.

Wait – the feedback “R(-)” in ROUND means R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (same as in RAISE). So positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are still open for R. We know:
- U is in position 3 (correct spot)
- N is in position 4 (correct spot)

So the word has the form _ _ U N _, and R must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- B R U N _ – but we’d need a 5th letter. BRUNG is 6 letters.
- _ _ U N R – again, no 5-letter word like “BUNNR” etc.

Realizing this, the only plausible 5-letter word I can think of is “BRUNT”:
B, R, U, N, T. Let’s check:
- B: new letter
- R: in position 2 (allowed)
- U: position 3 (correct)
- N: position 4 (correct)
- T: new letter
No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, O, D).

“BRUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “the edge or ridge of a hill; a sharp blow.”

A good starting word should use letters that frequently appear in English words and ideally include some vowels and common consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify which of these frequent letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is ROUND:

This suggests we might have made an error in assuming R must be in position 5.\n\nWait – we know R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ROUND). So R must be in position 3 or 4. However, positions 3 and 4 are already taken by U and N respectively. This is a contradiction – meaning our assumption that R must be in position 5 is wrong.\n\nRe-evaluating: R got “-” in both RAISE (position 1) and ROUND (position 1), but we have no info about positions 3, 4, or 5 for R. So R could still be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut we know:\n- U is in position 3 (from ROUND)\n- N is in position 4 (from ROUND)\n\nThus R must be in position 5. But no 5-letter word ends with “UNR” – so this suggests our interpretation might be missing something.\n\nWait – the feedback “R(-)” in ROUND means R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (same as in RAISE). So positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are still open for R. We know:\n- U is in position 3 (correct spot)\n- N is in position 4 (correct spot)\n\nSo the word has the form _ _ U N _, and R must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- B R U N _ – but we’d need a 5th letter. BRUNG is 6 letters.\n- _ _ U N R – again, no 5-letter word like “BUNNR” etc.\n\nRealizing this, the only plausible 5-letter word I can think of is “BRUNT”:\nB, R, U, N, T. Let’s check:\n- B: new letter\n- R: in position 2 (allowed)\n- U: position 3 (correct)\n- N: position 4 (correct)\n- T: new letter\nNo forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, O, D).\n\n“BRUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning “the edge or ridge of a hill; a sharp blow.”\n\n<guess>BRUNT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: BRUNT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(✓) N(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From all feedback so far:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far:

Pattern locked so far:
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 4: N (✓)

Letters we know are in the word: R, U, N, T  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, S, E, O, D, B, G  

We have the form: _ R U N _  
Because T is in the word but has gotten “-” (wrong position) when it was in position 5, T cannot be in position 5. The only remaining slot for T is position 1.

Therefore the word must be T R U N ? — but that is 5 letters already: TRU__  
Wait, positions are 1-5:  
1 2 3 4 5  
? R U N ?  

Since T must fit somewhere and can’t be in position 5, the only spot left is position 1.

Hence the only remaining possibility is:
T R U N ? — but we need a 5-letter word that starts TRUN. The only valid English word is TRUNK.

Check letters:
- T (position 1): allowed  
- R, U, N in their locked spots  
- K: has not been used or ruled out yet  

So TRUNK satisfies every constraint.
