Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The best initial strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help gather information efficiently. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- N (another common letter)

This gives a good spread across the alphabet to maximize information gain.

- R: not in the word (x)

Let’s try a word that places A in a different spot and uses new consonants.  
“STOMA” is valid, uses S, T, O, M, A, and places A in position 5.  
However, “PLAID” is also valid, places A in position 3 (where A was marked wrong), so skip that.  
“SAINT” contains N, which is ruled out.  
“TALON” contains N and O, but N is out.  
“ADMIT” has A in position 1 and uses D, M, I, T. This fits all rules.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FLOAT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The best initial strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help gather information efficiently. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (very common vowels)
- N (another common letter)

This gives a good spread across the alphabet to maximize information gain.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but in the wrong place (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd position)
- does NOT contain C, R, N, or E

We now need a new 5-letter word:
- must include A somewhere other than position 3
- must not include C, R, N, or E
- should use fresh common consonants to gather more info

Good consonants left: T, L, S, M, B, D, G, H, K, P, W, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present)

Let’s try a word that places A in a different spot and uses new consonants.  
“STOMA” is valid, uses S, T, O, M, A, and places A in position 5.  
However, “PLAID” is also valid, places A in position 3 (where A was marked wrong), so skip that.  
“SAINT” contains N, which is ruled out.  
“TALON” contains N and O, but N is out.  
“ADMIT” has A in position 1 and uses D, M, I, T. This fits all rules.

So “ADMIT”:
- A (known to be in the word) is in position 1 (new location)
- uses fresh consonants D, M, T and vowel I
- avoids C, R, N, E

Remaining usable consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining usable vowels: O, U (A is already known to be present somewhere in positions 2, 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Since T is in position 5, let’s look for words ending in T with A in position 2 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ T (A in position 2)
- _ _ _ A T (A in position 4)

Let’s pick “VAULT”:
- Ends in T (position 5) ✓
- Contains A in position 2 ✓
- Letters used: V, A, U, L, T  
  - V: not ruled out.  
  - A: must be in the word.  
  - U: allowed vowel.  
  - L: not ruled out.  
  - T: confirmed in position 5.

All constraints satisfied.

Alternative check: “BAWST” is not a valid English word, “GAULT” is obscure, “PATLY” uses A in position 2 but Y isn’t ruled out; however, “VAULT” is a common word and fits perfectly.

- Position 5: T ✓
- Position 4: A ✓

Known letters:
- A is in the word and in position 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (from feedback on VAULT).
- Ruled-out letters so far: C, R, N, E, D, M, I, V, U, S, P.

Remaining usable letters:
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, W, Y
Vowels: O (since A is fixed in position 4, U is out, E and I are out)

Pattern so far: _ _ _ A T

We need:
- 3 consonants for positions 1, 2, 3
- L must appear in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 3 from VAULT feedback shows L is not in position 3), so L must be in position 1 or 2.

Possible patterns:
1. L _ _ A T
2. _ L _ A T

Let's explore these:

1. L _ _ A T:
   - Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3 from remaining usable letters.
   - Possible combinations: L B H → LBHAT (not valid), L F G → LFGAT (invalid), etc.
   - Common English word check: LY... but Y is usable only as consonant.
   - ""LY...AT"" – nothing common.

2. _ L _ A T:
   - Need consonants for positions 1 and 3.
   - Let's pick position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, W, Y
   - Position 3: same remaining consonants, but must avoid L (already used in position 2)
   - Let's try combinations:
     - B L _ A T: BL...AT
       - BLOAT – valid word, uses B, L, O, A, T
         - Check letters: B (ok), L (ok), O (ok), A (fixed), T (fixed)
         - All letters allowed
     - Other options like FL...AT would need O as only remaining vowel, but FLOAT has O in position 3 which is allowed.

Both BLOAT and FLOAT are valid, but let's see which fits better:
- FLOAT: F, L, O, A, T
  - F: not ruled out
  - L: must be in word, position 2 (ok)
  - O: only remaining vowel option
  - A: position 4 (fixed)
  - T: position 5 (fixed)
- BLOAT: Same pattern but B in position 1

Between these, FLOAT is more commonly used. Let's proceed with FLOAT.
