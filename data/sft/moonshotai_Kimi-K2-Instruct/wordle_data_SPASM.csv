For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""STARE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""STARE"" is a strong first guess because:
- It contains very common letters (S, T, A, R, E)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- It has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, T, R)
- It can help identify multiple letters early in the game

Another good option is ""RAISE"" which has similar properties. However, I'll go with ""STARE"" as it seems slightly more balanced.

The feedback from STARE tells us:

- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- A is in the correct third position (✓)
- Letters T, R, and E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is: S _ A _ _

The remaining letters we know cannot be T, R, or E.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Good consonants to try might be L, N, M, P, C, D, etc. For vowels, we still have I, O, U left (since A is already used and E is ruled out).

Possible next guesses might be:
- SNAIL (S N A I L) - but L is in position 5 which is fine
- SPANK (S P A N K) - but K might be too uncommon
- SLAND (not a word)
- SCAMP (but M and P are both possible)

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit S _ A _ _ and don't use T, R, or E:

Some possibilities:
- SNACK
- SMALL
- SWAMP
- SLACK
- SCANT (but T is ruled out)
- SPASM (but S is already in position 1)

""SNACK"" seems good - it uses common letters N, C, K and the vowel A is already confirmed in position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- S is in the correct first position (✓)

So the pattern so far is: S _ A _ _

The remaining letters we know cannot be T, R, or E.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Good consonants to try might be L, N, M, P, C, D, etc. For vowels, we still have I, O, U left (since A is already used and E is ruled out).

Possible next guesses might be:
- SNAIL (S N A I L) - but L is in position 5 which is fine
- SPANK (S P A N K) - but K might be too uncommon
- SLAND (not a word)
- SCAMP (but M and P are both possible)

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit S _ A _ _ and don't use T, R, or E:

Some possibilities:
- SNACK
- SMALL
- SWAMP
- SLACK
- SCANT (but T is ruled out)
- SPASM (but S is already in position 1)

""SNACK"" seems good - it uses common letters N, C, K and the vowel A is already confirmed in position 3.Based on the feedback showing S and A are in correct positions, and T, R, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that keeps S and A in place while testing new letters for positions 2 and 4.

- S appears again somewhere (the last feedback shows S(-) for the final letter, so a second **S** exists but is **not** in position 5).

Hence the only possibility is SPAMS itself, but we already guessed that and the second S was marked (-) for position 5, meaning the repeated S must actually appear in position 4, not position 5. This leads to a contradiction, so I re-examine.

Wait: the word must be 5 letters and contain two S’s with the pattern SPAS_ . The only valid English word fitting is “SPASM”, but M is supposed to be in the word and already placed at position 4, so SPASM would place M at 4, giving SPASM. Let me check if SPASM is valid and uses allowed letters:

- M is finally in position 4, satisfying the new placement.
