For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain
2. Doesn't repeat letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and common consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

Some good first guesses include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it covers the most common letters and is easy to remember.

Letters known TO be in the word:

- U (locked to position 3)
- N (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5)

Fixed pattern so far:
- 2nd letter = R
- 3rd letter = U
- 5th letter ≠ N but we know N must appear somewhere else.

So the word looks like: _ R U _ N is impossible because N cannot be in position 5, but we know N must appear. Therefore N must be in position 4.

Hence the word must be: _ R U N _

Letters left to place in position 1 and 5, using only allowed letters (not S,T,A,E,O,D,B,I).

Remaining letters that are legal: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, W, etc.

We need two different letters for positions 1 and 5, both from this allowed set.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Contains common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain
2. Doesn't repeat letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and common consonants like R, S, T, N, L. 

Some good first guesses include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it covers the most common letters and is easy to remember.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, T, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the word:
- Does NOT contain S, T, A, E.
- Does contain R, but R is not in the 4th spot.

I need a 5-letter word without S, T, A, E, and with R not in the 4th position. To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining consonants and vowels. Good remaining vowels: I, O, U. Good consonants: N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

Candidate words:
- DRINK (but N and K are okay, but D is okay, I is okay, R is okay, but R is in position 2 here—allowed since R is not in position 4)
- ROUND (O, U, N, D—no S, T, A, E; R is in position 1—allowed)
- PRIMO (P, R, I, M, O—no S, T, A, E; R is in position 2—allowed)
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y—no S, T, A, E; R is in position 2—allowed)

I’ll choose ""ROUND"" as it introduces new vowels (O, U) and common consonants (N, D) while satisfying all constraints.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)
   - Eliminated letters: S, T, A, E
   - R is in the word, but not in position 1.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(x) U(✓) N(✓) D(x)
   - Eliminated letters: O, D
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
   - R is in the word but not in position 1 (consistent with first feedback).

So we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ U N
- Contains R (not in position 1)
- Does not contain S, T, A, E, O, D

Possible remaining letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, R, W, Y, etc.

I need to form a 5-letter word ending in ""U N"", with R somewhere (but not position 1), and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- BRUIN: B, R, U, I, N → ends with U N, has R (position 2), no banned letters. But I is used, which is fine.
- CRUIN: C, R, U, I, N → same as above with C instead of B.
- PRUNE: but E is eliminated.
- FRUIN: F, R, U, I, N → possible.
- GRUIN: G, R, U, I, N → possible.

""BRUIN"" seems most common among these options.
