For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Popular and effective choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: extremely common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2).
- A, T, E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The second letter is L.
2. The letters S, A, T, E are not present.
3. We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, N, C, etc.).

Good next steps:
- Include a new vowel (like I or O or U) since A and E are out.
- Try consonants like R, N, C, M, etc.
- Avoid S, A, T, E.

A strong candidate is ""CLINK"":
- C: common consonant.
- L: confirmed at position 2.
- I: new vowel to test.
- N, K: common consonants to test.

But let's pick a more balanced word: ""FLING"":
- F: new consonant.
- L: confirmed at position 2.
- I: new vowel.
- N, G: common consonants.

Actually, better to test O and U too. How about ""BLOCK"":
- B: new consonant.

- O: new vowel.
- C, K: new consonants.

From the feedback so far we have a locked-in pattern:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Popular and effective choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: extremely common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2).
- A, T, E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The second letter is L.
2. The letters S, A, T, E are not present.
3. We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, N, C, etc.).

Good next steps:
- Include a new vowel (like I or O or U) since A and E are out.
- Try consonants like R, N, C, M, etc.
- Avoid S, A, T, E.

A strong candidate is ""CLINK"":
- C: common consonant.
- L: confirmed at position 2.
- I: new vowel to test.
- N, K: common consonants to test.

But let's pick a more balanced word: ""FLING"":
- F: new consonant.
- L: confirmed at position 2.
- I: new vowel.
- N, G: common consonants.

Actually, better to test O and U too. How about ""BLOCK"":
- B: new consonant.
- L: at position 2.
- O: new vowel.
- C, K: new consonants.

This tests O and gives us more info.
