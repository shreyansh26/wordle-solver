Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. Words with common vowels and consonants are good choices. Some popular starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is a very common consonant
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter in English

This combination should give us good information about the presence/absence of several common letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).  
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore:
- The word does NOT contain R, A, N, or E.  
- It DOES contain C, but not in the first position.  
- The remaining letters of the alphabet still in play (roughly): B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z.

To maximize information on the second guess, we should:
1. Keep the known letter C, but move it to a different position.  
2. Introduce several new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
3. Avoid any of the ruled-out letters (R, A, N, E).

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C is tested in position 2 (new spot).  
- L, O, U, D are all new letters that are fairly common and give good coverage of remaining possibilities.  
- None of the ruled-out letters are used.

So I’ll guess “CLOUD”.

- O is not in position 3.

4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, A, N, E, L, D).

From all feedback so far:

Known facts:
1. Word must contain: C, O, U, S
2. Fixed positions:
   - U is in slot 4
   - O is in slot 2
   - S is in slot 5
3. C is present but not yet locked to a position.  
   Possible positions for C: 3 only (cannot be 1, 2, 4, 5 because 1 already ruled out, 2 is O, 4 is U, 5 is S).

Therefore the skeleton of the word is:
_ O C U S

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: R, A, N, E, L, D, B, G.

Still-available letters (common ones): F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid 5-letter words matching _OCUS are:
FOCUS, HOCUS, POCUS (variant spelling of “hocus”), TOCUS (archaic), etc.

Among these, FOCUS is the only standard everyday word.

So the next guess is: FOCUS.
