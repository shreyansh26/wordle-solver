For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the target word. The word should also avoid repeating any letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Looking at common letter frequencies in English, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S are among the most frequent. The word ""AROSE"" contains 5 unique letters including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S) in strategic positions. This makes it an excellent first guess to gather maximum information about the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. R is the only letter from AROSE that’s present.
2. R is not in position 2.
3. We can eliminate A, O, S, E for the entire word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes R (not in position 2).
- Excludes A, O, S, E.
- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize info.

Looking for common consonant-vowel patterns: common remaining high-frequency letters include T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is “TRIUM” because:
- It includes R (not in position 2).
- It avoids A, O, S, E.
- Uses T, R, I, U, M – all distinct and reasonably common.

But we must ensure “TRIUM” is valid; actually, “TRIUM” isn’t recognized as a common 5-letter English word (trium is archaic). A better valid word is “TRIUN” (also not valid). Instead, let’s pick “TRUCK”:
- T, R, U, C, K – all valid letters, distinct, no excluded vowels/consonants.

However, U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, and we still avoid A, O, E, S.

But “TRUCK” has R in position 2, which we know is invalid. So shift R.

Next candidate: “BRICK”:
- B, R, I, C, K – valid letters, no excluded ones, and R is in position 2 (still bad).

Shift R again: “CRIMP”
- C, R, I, M, P – R is in position 2 again.

Try R in position 3: “CURIO” – invalid (O excluded).

R in position 4: “FRUIT” – F, R, U, I, T – no A, O, S, E; R in position 2 is bad.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words avoiding A, O, S, E and not placing R in position 2.

Good candidates: “DRIFT” (R in position 2 – bad), “PRINT” (R in position 2 – bad), “FRITH” (archaic), “BRINY” (R in position 2 – bad).

Next best: “RIGHT” – R in position 1 (good), I, G, H, T – none are A, O, S, E.

“RIGHT” is valid and uses common letters.
