For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some good options would be:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E (all very common)
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""STARE"" - uses S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes the top 5 most common letters (E, A, R, O, S) and gives us good coverage.

From Guess 1 feedback:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the secret word (all marked x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked -).

So the word contains S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
Letters still possible: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z.

We need another vowel besides A, O, E. The remaining vowels are I and U.  
Consonant frequency among remaining letters is high for T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A good second guess maximizes new letter coverage.  
Possible candidates:  
- ""UNTIL"" – uses U, N, T, I, L, but we don’t know if I/L/N/T are in yet.  
- ""SIGHT"" – uses S (known to be present), plus I, G, H, T.  
- ""STUMP"" – uses S, T, U, M, P.  

""SIGHT"" seems strong because it places S in position 1 (new position) and tests I/G/H/T.

But if we want to test U as a vowel, ""UNTIL"" is also good.  
Let me choose ""UNTIL"" to test U, N, T, I, L.

- Letter N is in the word but not at position 2.
- Letters T and L are not in the word.
- Letter I is in the word but not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Position 1 is U.
- Word contains S, N, I (each in some other position).
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, E, T, L.

Letters remaining to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known U, S, N, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with U.
- Contains S, N, I somewhere (but not in positions 4, 2, and 4 respectively).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters.

Possible positions for S, N, I:
- S cannot be in position 4.
- N cannot be in position 2.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Let’s try USNIC: uses U, S, N, I, C.  
Check positions:
- U at 1 ✓.
- S at 2 (allowed).
- N at 3 (allowed, not at 2).
- I at 4 (forbidden, because I cannot be at 4). So USNIC is invalid.

- I at 3 is allowed.  
- N at 4 is allowed (only restricted from 2).
