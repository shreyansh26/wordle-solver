When making a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include: A, E, I, O, U for vowels and R, T, N, S, L, C for consonants.

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S and L (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- T (very common consonant)
This gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word right away.

- S → x (not in word)
- L → x (not in word)
- A → x (not in word)
- T → x (not in word)
- E → - (in word but wrong position)

So the secret word:

- Definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- E is not in the 5th position

Since we’ve eliminated S, L, A, T, we want a new guess that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last spot
2. Uses common letters not yet tried (R, N, I, C, O, U, etc.)

Interpreting the new feedback:

CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)

- C, H, O: not in the word at all.
- R: in the word but not in position 4.
- E: in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O
- Letters definitely in the word: E, R
- E is **not** in position 5
- R is **not** in position 4

Remaining frequent consonants: N, D, G, M, P, B, F, K
Remaining vowels: I, U, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both E and R
2. Places E somewhere other than position 5
3. Places R somewhere other than position 4
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters (no S,L,A,T,C,H,O)

A quick scan of common patterns that fit “E and R, no S/L/A/T/C/H/O” yields:  
- “INNER” – but it repeats N, and we have no info on N yet.  
- “NERVE” – contains V, lower frequency letter.  
- “REIGN” – uses G and I, but has O which is banned.  
- “DINER” – uses D and I, both still allowed, and satisfies all constraints.

DINER:
- Uses D, I, N, E, R – none of the banned letters.
- Positions: E is in slot 3 (allowed), R is in slot 5 (allowed).  
- Provides new letters D, I, N to test.

So DINER is a solid third guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Good starting words often include: A, E, I, O, U for vowels and R, T, N, S, L, C for consonants.

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S and L (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- T (very common consonant)
This gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word right away.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S → x (not in word)
- L → x (not in word)
- A → x (not in word)
- T → x (not in word)
- E → - (in word but wrong position)

So the secret word:
- Definitely contains E
- Definitely does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- E is not in the 5th position

Since we’ve eliminated S, L, A, T, we want a new guess that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last spot
2. Uses common letters not yet tried (R, N, I, C, O, U, etc.)
3. Avoids the eliminated letters

A strong second guess that meets these criteria is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are new letters not yet tested
- E is repositioned from 5th to 4th place
- All letters are valid and common in English five-letter words

- C, H, O: not in the word at all.

- E: in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O
- Letters definitely in the word: E, R
- E is **not** in position 5
- R is **not** in position 4

Remaining frequent consonants: N, D, G, M, P, B, F, K
Remaining vowels: I, U, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both E and R
2. Places E somewhere other than position 5
3. Places R somewhere other than position 4
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters (no S,L,A,T,C,H,O)

A quick scan of common patterns that fit “E and R, no S/L/A/T/C/H/O” yields:  
- “INNER” – but it repeats N, and we have no info on N yet.  
- “NERVE” – contains V, lower frequency letter.  
- “REIGN” – uses G and I, but has O which is banned.  
- “DINER” – uses D and I, both still allowed, and satisfies all constraints.

DINER:
- Uses D, I, N, E, R – none of the banned letters.
- Positions: E is in slot 3 (allowed), R is in slot 5 (allowed).  
- Provides new letters D, I, N to test.

So DINER is a solid third guess.

- “DINER” – uses D and I, both still allowed, and satisfies all constraints.

DINER:
- Uses D, I, N, E, R – none of the banned letters.
- Positions: E is in slot 3 (allowed), R is in slot 5 (allowed).  
- Provides new letters D, I, N to test.

So DINER is a solid third guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback on DINER:

DINER → D(x) I(x) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)

- D, I, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the 4th position.
- R is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we have:

Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, D, I, N
Letters confirmed in the word: E (position 4), R (position 5)
Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in the 4th position
- R in the 5th position
- No S, L, A, T, C, H, O, D, I, N
- Uses only remaining possible letters

The word ends with ""ER"". We need to find a valid English word with pattern _ _ _ E R.

Possible combinations:
- ""FEVER"" – but V is allowed, E is confirmed, but F and V are new letters.
- ""MOWER"" – but O is banned.
- ""JUMPER"" – too long.
- ""GAMER"" – A is banned.
- ""BUYER"" – U and Y are allowed, B and Y are new.
- ""PETER"" – but P, E, T, E, R – T is banned.
- ""WAFER"" – A is banned.
- ""BUMPER"" – too long.
- ""FUGUE"" – doesn't fit pattern.
- ""BUYER"" – B, U, Y, E, R – all allowed, fits pattern _ _ _ E R.

""Buyer"" is a valid 5-letter word ending with ER, and uses B, U, Y which haven't been tested yet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
- Positions 4 & 5 are E and R respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word at all: S L A T C H O D I N B Y
- Letters confirmed IN the word: U must appear somewhere before the last two spots (because U shows ✓ in position 2 of BUYER but the same position in the secret word is not U’s final place).

So the pattern is: _ U _ E R  (since U is in the word but not in position 2).

Remaining unused letters from the alphabet (excluding the banned ones): F G J K M P V W X Z  
We need a valid English 5-letter word ending in “U E R” with one of those remaining consonants in front.  
Scanning possibilities:
- F → FU__ER? → FUMER isn’t common.
- M → MUGER – no.
- P → PUGER – no.
- G → GUE?? – “GUESS” but S is banned, and we need _ U _ E R.
- V → V + U + _ E R → “V” + “U” + ? → “VOTER” but O and T are banned.
- W → W + U + _ E R → “W” + “U” + ? → “WIPER” – I is banned.
- K → K + U + _ E R → “K” + “U” + ? → “KUGER” – no.
- J → JUGER – valid word (archaic spelling of “jouger” but accepted by most dictionaries).

“JUGER” fits _ U _ E R, uses only still-allowed letters, and is 5 letters.

From all feedback so far we have:

Known positions:
4 = E, 5 = R

Known letters in the word:
U must appear somewhere in positions 1–3.

Letters still unused (and not yet ruled out):
F, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

We therefore need a 5-letter word with pattern:

The only common English word that fits is “FUMER” – F is still allowed and no forbidden letters appear. (M has not been used yet, either.)

Hence, the next logical guess is FUMER.
