For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities efficiently. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it uses 5 highly common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in many words. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:  
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:  
- contains the letter E (but not as the last letter).  
- does **not** contain A, R, O, S.  

We also want to introduce fresh, common letters that we haven’t tested yet.  
Common letters we haven’t tried: L, I, N, T, U, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
A good first-principles guess would combine E with several new high-frequency consonants and vowels, e.g., L, I, N, T.

The word “UNTIE” uses:  
- U, N, T, I, E  
- E is repositioned away from the 5th spot.  
- None of the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S) appear.  

This should maximize new information while respecting all constraints.

1. Contains E exactly once (so far only one E has been hinted).
2. Uses none of the ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

- Letters: W, H, E, L, P — none are in the banned set.
- Places E in position 3.
- Introduces four new letters (W, H, L, P), giving maximal information.

From the feedback:

1. W is in the word and in the correct first position.  
2. H, E, L are in the word but misplaced (they are somewhere else).  
3. P is not in the word.  

Known so far:
- Word starts with W.  
- Contains H, E, L (each in some position 2–5).  
- Already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, P.  

We still need to place E, H, L in positions 2–5 without reusing any ruled-out letters.  
We have not yet tried B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
- keep W in slot 1.  
- rearrange H, E, L into new slots (2–5) while introducing fresh consonants.

Candidate: WELCH  
- starts with W (✓).  
- uses E, L, H in new positions (2,3,5).  
- introduces C in position 4.  

All letters are still allowed and it’s a valid English word.
