For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with commonly occurring letters in English, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Multiple vowels (to check for A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, N, R)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Potential options: SLATE, CRANE, SOARE, ARISE, ROATE, RAISE, ADIEU, AUDIO, TRAIN, etc.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S: not in the word (x)
- L: correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _
- A: in the word but wrong spot (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong spot (-)

Known so far:
- L is in position 2
- A and E are both in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively
- S and T are not in the word at all

Next guess should:
- Keep L in position 2
- Include both A and E but in different positions
- Avoid S and T
- Use common letters for the remaining spots

Possible structure: _ L _ _ _ with A and E somewhere, plus two new consonants.

Good candidates:
- CLADE (but C might be less common)
- PLANE (but N is good, P less common)
- FLAKE (F less common)
- GLADE (G less common)
- BLAME (B less common)
- ALONE (but A can't be in position 1 because then it would be AL--- and we know A is not in position 3)
- LEAFY (but Y is less common and we need to fit A somewhere)

Another approach: use a word with A and E in positions they haven't been, and common consonants. 

Consider ""PLANE"":
- P: not used yet
- L: in correct position (✓)
- A: new position (position 3 was incorrect, so try position 1 or 4)

From the new feedback on CLEAR:

- C: not in the word (x)
- L: still in correct position 2 (✓)
- E: now in correct position 3 (✓)
- A: now in correct position 4 (✓)
- R: not in the word (x)

Current pattern: _ L E A _

Letters known:
- Must have: L, E, A in positions 2, 3, 4
- Must NOT have: S, T, C, R
- A and E were originally marked as ""in word but wrong position"" in SLATE, but now they are in correct positions, so that information is superseded
- Missing letters: positions 1 and 5

We need two consonants that haven't been ruled out and fit common English patterns.

Common consonants remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at _ L E A _ endings:
Common words ending with ...LEA_ or similar:
- BLEAK
- PLEAD
- GLEAN
- FLEAM (archaic)
- DREAD (but R is out)
- BREAD (R is out)
- PLEAS (S is out)
- GLEAM
- CLEAN (N and C)
- FLEAK (not a word)

From this list, GLEAM and BLEAK seem the best bets:
- GLEAM: G, L, E, A, M
- BLEAK: B, L, E, A, K

Both share the LEA in positions 2-4, so the choice is between G or B in position 1 and M or K in position 5.

Both G and B are reasonable starting consonants. Similarly, M and K are both common word endings.

Between these, BLEAK seems slightly more common as a word, so I'll go with that.
