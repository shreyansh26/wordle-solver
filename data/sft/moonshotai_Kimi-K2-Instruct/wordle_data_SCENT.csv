For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)  
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad sampling of letters to work with. I'm going with ARISE as my first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x), R(x), I(x) → A, R, I are **not** in the word at all.
- S(-), E(-) → S and E **are** in the word but in the **wrong** positions (S was 4th, E was 5th).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Places S **not** in position 4, and E **not** in position 5.
3. Avoids the letters A, R, I.

I’ll look for a common 5-letter word that uses S and E in other positions and introduces new, frequent consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Contains S and E.
- S is in position 3 (not 4), E is in position 5 (but this violates the feedback since E was originally in position 5 and marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but wrong position). So E must move.

Another candidate: “STEAL” – but it contains A, which is banned.

Next: “SHEET” – but E is last again (position 5), which is disallowed.

Next: “SLEEP” – E is in position 4 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed). Also introduces new letters L and P. This seems good.

But let me double-check: feedback rules say E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is fine. S was in position 4 before, now we’re moving it to position 1 – also fine. No A, R, I.

“SLEEP” fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know from both guesses.

Guess 1: ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
- A, R, I are not in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Guess 2: SLEEP → S(✓) L(x) E(✓) E(-) P(x)
- S is in position 1 and is correct (✓). So the word starts with S _ _ _ _.
- E is in position 3 and is correct (✓). So the word is S _ E _ _.
- The second E in position 4 is marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. This confirms E is in position 3 (already ✓) and no second E exists in position 4.
- L and P are not in the word.

So far the word looks like:
S _ E _ _
Letters known to be absent: A, R, I, L, P
Letters known to be present: S, E (positions 1 and 3 locked)

We still need to find the 2nd and 5th letters, which must be from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words that fit S _ E _ _ and use only allowed letters. Good candidates include:
- S _ E _ _
  - SHEET – but E in position 4 is disallowed (from Guess 1: E not in 5, and we already have E in 3). Also T is allowed but word must be 5 letters.
  - S _ E _ _ – let’s brainstorm possible endings:
    - SNEEK – not common
    - SMELT – but L is banned
    - S _ E _ _ – possible endings: K, D, etc.

A common word that fits is ""SWEET"":
- S W E E T – but this has a second E in position 4 (disallowed, as we saw E cannot be in position 4 or 5). So this is invalid.

Next common word: ""SKEET"":
- S K E E T – again double E issue.

Next: ""SHEEN"":
- S H E E N – double E issue.

Next: ""S _ E _ _"" with valid letters: Let's try ""S _ E _ _"" where the 2nd and 5th letters are new.

Possible candidates:
- S O E _ _ – but no common words
- S _ E _ _ – think of ""S _ E _ _"" like ""S _ E _ _""

Actually, a good candidate is ""S _ E _ _"" with:
- 2nd letter: common consonants like H, M, N, etc.
- 5th letter: common ending letters like D, K, T, etc.

Let’s try ""SHED"":
- But this is 4 letters. Need 5.

""SHEND"" – not a word.

""SMELT"" – L is banned.

""SPEND"" – P is banned.

""S _ E _ _"" – let me think differently. The word must be S _ E _ _, with no A, R, I, L, P, and E only in position 3.

Possible words:
- S C E N T – but N is 4th, T is 5th. Check letters: S, C, E, N, T. None are banned except L, P, A, R, I. This fits: S C E N T.

Does this fit all constraints?
- Starts with S (correct position).
- E in position 3 (correct position).
- No banned letters (A, R, I, L, P).
- S was not in position 4 (ok, it's in 1).
- E is not in position 5 (ok, it's in 3).
- Letters C, N, T are new and allowed.

""SCENT"" seems valid.
