Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in likely positions. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C)
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Have vowels and consonants to cover common patterns

Popular starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" follow this strategy. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage across different positions.

This should provide valuable information about which vowels are present and where common consonants might be positioned.

The first feedback shows:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – correct letter in correct position
- S (-) – present but in wrong position
- E (✓) – correct letter in correct position

So the hidden word looks like _ O _ _ E with S somewhere in the first four positions and no A or R.

Eliminated letters: A, R  
Confirmed letters: O (3rd), E (5th)  
S is present but not in 4th position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- has O in 3rd place and E in 5th place
- has S somewhere except 4th
- does not contain A or R

Possible patterns: S O _ _ E, _ O S _ E, _ O _ S E

Common words fitting these patterns: ""HOUSE"", ""GOOSE"", ""DOUSE"", ""MOOSE"", ""HORSE"", ""WORSE""  
But HORSE and WORSE contain R (eliminated).  
HOUSE: H, O, U, S, E – no A/R, S is 4th (forbidden by feedback).  
GOOSE: G, O, O, S, E – two O’s is allowed; S is 4th (forbidden).  
DOUSE: D, O, U, S, E – S is 4th (forbidden).  
MOOSE: M, O, O, S, E – S is 4th (forbidden).  

We need a word where S is in position 1 or 2:  
SO__E words: SOLVE, SONDE, SORBE (all contain R or forbidden S position)  
_O_S_E words: LOOSE (but O repeats).  

“LOOSE” has O twice, which is fine, and places S in position 4 (still forbidden).  

Next try: “DOSES” – but repeats S and has S in forbidden position, plus plural might be unlikely.  

Instead, let’s try “CLOVE”: C, L, O, V, E – fits O and E correctly, no A/R, and introduces new consonants. However, S must appear somewhere.  

We must include S. So:  
“POSSE” – P, O, S, S, E – has S in positions 3 and 4; 3 is O, 4 is forbidden.  

“MOUSE” – M, O, U, S, E – S is 4th (forbidden).  

“CHOSE” – C, H, O, S, E – S is 4th (forbidden).  

“JONES” – J, O, N, E, S – E is 4th (needs to be 5th). No.  

“VOLES” – V, O, L, E, S – E is 4th, needs 5th. No.  

“GLOBE” – no S.  

Actually, the only way to keep S while keeping O in 3rd and E in 5th is to place S in 1st or 2nd position.  

“STONE” – S, T, O, N, E – has N in 4th and E in 5th, O in 3rd. S is 1st (allowed). No A or R. This fits perfectly.

So my next guess is STONE.
