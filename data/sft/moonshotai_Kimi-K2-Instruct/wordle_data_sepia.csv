For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of possibilities to maximize information gained. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

Since I need to make a specific guess, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback was:
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong place.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong place.
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong place.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, E but NOT R or O.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that reuses the confirmed letters A, S, E, avoids R and O entirely, and tries new consonants while testing new positions for A, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
Vowels left to explore: I, U (since A and E are already known to be present).

I’ll pick a word that keeps A, S, E and introduces T and I.  
A simple candidate is “STEAL”.

Check positions:
- S now in position 1 (new position vs. 4 before).
- T is new.
- E now in position 3 (was 5 before).
- A now in position 2 (was 1 before).
- L is new.

This satisfies all constraints.

Let's tabulate everything we know so far.

Letters already fixed
- Position 1: S (✓ from STEAL and SPACE)

Letters definitely in the word
- S
- A
- E

Letters definitely NOT in the word (x-marked)
- R, O, T, L, C

Positions ruled out
- A is not in position 1 (AROSE), 4 (STEAL), or 3 (SPACE) → only possible 2 or 5
- E is not in position 3 (STEAL) or 5 (SPACE) → only possible 2 or 4
- P was tried at position 2 (SPACE) and marked “-” (wrong position) → P is in the word, but must be placed later.

Missing letters to place
- We have already placed S at 1. We still need to place A, E, P, plus one more letter that has not been eliminated.

Available consonants not yet ruled out (common ones): N, D, M, Y, G, B, V, F, etc.

Constraints on the remaining positions
Position 2: can be A or E
Position 3: must be P (because P is in the word and cannot be anywhere else; positions 1,4,5 are taken by S,A/E or the new letter)
Position 4: can be A or E (whichever isn’t in position 2)
Position 5: must be the new consonant.

Quick enumeration
- If position 2 = E, then position 4 = A, so template: S E P A _  
- If position 2 = A, then position 4 = E, so template: S A P E _

We need a consonant for position 5 that hasn’t appeared and is common. N, D, M, Y are good choices.

Let’s try the second template: S A P E _
With N as the new consonant we get “SAPEN”.  
But SAPEN is not a valid English word.

Next consonant: D → “SAPED” – also not valid.  
Next: M → “SAPEM” – no.  
Y → “SAPEY” – no.  

Try consonant N after S E P A: “SEPAN” – not valid.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, uses A and E in allowed spots, uses P, and a new consonant.

How about S P A N E?  
Check constraints:
- S (fixed at 1) ✓  
- P is now at position 2 – allowed because P was only marked “-” (wrong spot), so anywhere else is fine.  
- A at position 3 – allowed (only excluded from 1,3,4,5? Wait, SPACE excluded A at 3, so 3 is allowed.)  
- N new consonant.  
- E at 5 – but SPACE ruled out E at 5. So E cannot be at 5.  

So SPANE is invalid because E can’t be at 5.

Another candidate: S A P N E – invalid (same E at 5).

Next candidate: S E P A N – E at 2 (allowed), P at 3 (new), A at 4 (allowed – not excluded from 4), N at 5 (new).  
Word: SEPAN – not valid.

Try S E P A D: SEPAD – no.

Try S P E A N – SPEAN – not a valid word.

Try S P E N A – SPENA – not valid.

Try S A P E N – SAPEN – not valid.

Try S N E A P – SNEAP – valid (archaic but accepted as a 5-letter word).

Check constraints:
- S 1 ✓  
- N at 2 (new) – allowed  
- E at 3 (allowed – only 3 was excluded for E in STEAL)  
- A at 4 (allowed – only 1,4 excluded for A in STEAL; but SPACE excluded 3 for A. Allowed at 4)  
- P at 5 (new) – allowed  

So SNEAP fits all constraints and uses known letters plus N.

Therefore, the next guess is SNEAP.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sepia,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of possibilities to maximize information gained. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

Since I need to make a specific guess, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback was:
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong place.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong place.
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong place.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, E but NOT R or O.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that reuses the confirmed letters A, S, E, avoids R and O entirely, and tries new consonants while testing new positions for A, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
Vowels left to explore: I, U (since A and E are already known to be present).

I’ll pick a word that keeps A, S, E and introduces T and I.  
A simple candidate is “STEAL”.

Check positions:
- S now in position 1 (new position vs. 4 before).
- T is new.
- E now in position 3 (was 5 before).
- A now in position 2 (was 1 before).
- L is new.

This satisfies all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
- A present, not at position 1.
- R and O absent.
- S present, not at position 4.
- E present, not at position 5.

Guess 2: STEAL → S(✓) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
- S is now fixed at position 1.
- T and L absent.
- E present, not at position 3.
- A present, not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and E, positions still unsure (but A ≠ 1,4 and E ≠ 3,5).
- Absent letters: R, O, T, L.

Remaining letters to try: common consonants like N, C, D, P, M, etc.

A good next word would preserve S at 1 and try to place A and E in new positions while introducing new consonants.

Candidate: S _ _ _ _
Possible letters: A, E, N, C, D, P, M, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s choose “SPACE”:
- S (1) kept.
- P new consonant.
- A in position 2 (new spot).
- C new consonant.
- E in position 5 (new spot).

This fits all constraints and tests new letters.

 – E: not 3, 5  
 – P: not 2, 5  
 – S: not 2, 3, 4, 5 (already fixed at 1)  

Step 2 – Map possible slots  
Template: S _ _ _ _

Positions 2-5 must use A, E, P plus exactly one more letter (must be consonant not yet excluded).  
Available consonants (not ruled out): D, G, B, V, F, M, Y, H, K, etc.

Step 3 – Determine placements for A, E, P  
A can only sit at 2 or 5 (excluded from 1,3,4).  
E can only sit at 2 or 4 (excluded from 3,5).  
P can sit at 3 or 4 (excluded from 2,5).

Enumerate feasible permutations:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,sepia,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of possibilities to maximize information gained. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

Since I need to make a specific guess, I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback was:
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong place.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong place.
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong place.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, E but NOT R or O.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that reuses the confirmed letters A, S, E, avoids R and O entirely, and tries new consonants while testing new positions for A, S, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
Vowels left to explore: I, U (since A and E are already known to be present).

I’ll pick a word that keeps A, S, E and introduces T and I.  
A simple candidate is “STEAL”.

Check positions:
- S now in position 1 (new position vs. 4 before).
- T is new.
- E now in position 3 (was 5 before).
- A now in position 2 (was 1 before).
- L is new.

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
- A present, not at position 1.
- R and O absent.
- S present, not at position 4.
- E present, not at position 5.

Guess 2: STEAL → S(✓) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
- S is now fixed at position 1.
- T and L absent.
- E present, not at position 3.
- A present, not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and E, positions still unsure (but A ≠ 1,4 and E ≠ 3,5).
- Absent letters: R, O, T, L.

Remaining letters to try: common consonants like N, C, D, P, M, etc.

A good next word would preserve S at 1 and try to place A and E in new positions while introducing new consonants.

Candidate: S _ _ _ _
Possible letters: A, E, N, C, D, P, M, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s choose “SPACE”:
- S (1) kept.
- P new consonant.
- A in position 2 (new spot).
- C new consonant.
- E in position 5 (new spot).

This fits all constraints and tests new letters.

Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: SPACE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(-) A(-) C(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's tabulate everything we know so far.

Letters already fixed
- Position 1: S (✓ from STEAL and SPACE)

Letters definitely in the word
- S
- A
- E

Letters definitely NOT in the word (x-marked)
- R, O, T, L, C

Positions ruled out
- A is not in position 1 (AROSE), 4 (STEAL), or 3 (SPACE) → only possible 2 or 5
- E is not in position 3 (STEAL) or 5 (SPACE) → only possible 2 or 4
- P was tried at position 2 (SPACE) and marked “-” (wrong position) → P is in the word, but must be placed later.

Missing letters to place
- We have already placed S at 1. We still need to place A, E, P, plus one more letter that has not been eliminated.

Available consonants not yet ruled out (common ones): N, D, M, Y, G, B, V, F, etc.

Constraints on the remaining positions
Position 2: can be A or E
Position 3: must be P (because P is in the word and cannot be anywhere else; positions 1,4,5 are taken by S,A/E or the new letter)
Position 4: can be A or E (whichever isn’t in position 2)
Position 5: must be the new consonant.

Quick enumeration
- If position 2 = E, then position 4 = A, so template: S E P A _  
- If position 2 = A, then position 4 = E, so template: S A P E _

We need a consonant for position 5 that hasn’t appeared and is common. N, D, M, Y are good choices.

Let’s try the second template: S A P E _
With N as the new consonant we get “SAPEN”.  
But SAPEN is not a valid English word.

Next consonant: D → “SAPED” – also not valid.  
Next: M → “SAPEM” – no.  
Y → “SAPEY” – no.  

Try consonant N after S E P A: “SEPAN” – not valid.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, uses A and E in allowed spots, uses P, and a new consonant.

How about S P A N E?  
Check constraints:
- S (fixed at 1) ✓  
- P is now at position 2 – allowed because P was only marked “-” (wrong spot), so anywhere else is fine.  
- A at position 3 – allowed (only excluded from 1,3,4,5? Wait, SPACE excluded A at 3, so 3 is allowed.)  
- N new consonant.  
- E at 5 – but SPACE ruled out E at 5. So E cannot be at 5.  

So SPANE is invalid because E can’t be at 5.

Another candidate: S A P N E – invalid (same E at 5).

Next candidate: S E P A N – E at 2 (allowed), P at 3 (new), A at 4 (allowed – not excluded from 4), N at 5 (new).  
Word: SEPAN – not valid.

Try S E P A D: SEPAD – no.

Try S P E A N – SPEAN – not a valid word.

Try S P E N A – SPENA – not valid.

Try S A P E N – SAPEN – not valid.

Try S N E A P – SNEAP – valid (archaic but accepted as a 5-letter word).

Check constraints:
- S 1 ✓  
- N at 2 (new) – allowed  
- E at 3 (allowed – only 3 was excluded for E in STEAL)  
- A at 4 (allowed – only 1,4 excluded for A in STEAL; but SPACE excluded 3 for A. Allowed at 4)  
- P at 5 (new) – allowed  

So SNEAP fits all constraints and uses known letters plus N.

Therefore, the next guess is SNEAP.

Available consonants (not ruled out): D, G, B, V, F, M, Y, H, K, etc.

Step 3 – Determine placements for A, E, P  
A can only sit at 2 or 5 (excluded from 1,3,4).  
E can only sit at 2 or 4 (excluded from 3,5).

S _ _ E A

Let’s list everything we now know.

Fixed letters:
- Position 1: S (✓ every time).

Letters that MUST appear:
- S (already placed at 1)
- A
- E
- P

Letters that CANNOT appear:
R, O, T, L, C, N, D

Positions already ruled out:
- A: not at 1 (AROSE), 2 (SAPED), 4 (STEAL), 3 (SPACE) ⇒ A must be at 5
- E: not at 3 (STEAL), 5 (SPACE) ⇒ E must be at 2 or 4
- P: not at 2 (SPACE), 5 (SNEAP) ⇒ P must be at 3 or 4

Current template: S _ _ _ _

Because A must sit at position 5, we immediately have:
S _ _ _ A

So the remaining letters to place (in positions 2, 3, 4) are E and P plus one fresh consonant (must be chosen from unused consonants like B, G, F, M, Y, etc.).

But we have only three slots and four required letters (S, A, E, P plus one new consonant).  
Since S and A are already fixed, the remaining positions 2-4 must contain E and P once each and one new consonant.  
Hence the five letters are S, A, E, P, and one new consonant.

We need a valid English word matching S _ _ _ A with E and P in the middle three positions, plus one new consonant.

Enumerate possibilities:

1. E at 2, P at 3 → S E P _ A → need a consonant at 4  
   Valid word: S E P I A → but I has not been excluded; let’s check.  
   Actually, using letter I is allowed because I hasn’t been used yet.  
   Google check: “SEP” + “IA” → no, but “SEPIA” is 5 letters.  “SEPIA” is valid.

2. E at 2, P at 4 → S E _ P A → need consonant at 3 → S E ? P A → nothing common.

3. E at 4, P at 3 → S _ P E A → need consonant at 2 → S ? P E A → “SPYEA” – invalid.

4. E at 4, P at 2 – but P can’t be at 2 (SPACE feedback).

Thus the only valid word matching all constraints is SEPIA.

Check SEPIA against every rule:
- S at 1 ✓  
- E at 2 (allowed)  
- P at 3 (allowed)  
- I (new letter) at 4  
- A at 5 (required)  
All excluded letters avoided, all required letters present, all position exclusions satisfied.
