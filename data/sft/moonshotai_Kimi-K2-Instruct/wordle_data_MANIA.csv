For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, and I. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, CRANE is particularly good because it uses C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters and covers vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This will help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and which aren't.

From the feedback:
- C, R, E are NOT in the word (marked x).
- A and N are in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and N.
- Does NOT contain C, R, E.

I need a 5-letter word that includes A and N, avoids C, R, E, and places A and N somewhere different from positions 3 and 4.

Common letters left to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that uses other common letters, especially A and N. Thinking of words like:
- SLANT (but T is last and A is in position 3, which we know is incorrect for A)
- PLANK (A is in position 3 again)
- SANDY (but S is position 1, A is position 2, N is position 3 - A can't be 3, N can't be 4, so N at 3 is allowed)
Wait, in CRANE, A was position 3 (marked -), so A cannot be position 3. N was position 4 (marked -), so N cannot be position 4.

SANDY: A at 2, N at 3 - this satisfies both conditions (A not 3, N not 4). Also checks for S and D.

Another option: MANLY (A at 2, N at 3 again)
- M, A, N, L, Y - all letters are new except A and N which we know are in word.

Between SANDY and MANLY, SANDY has S and D which are common. MANLY has M, L, Y which are also common. Both seem good, but SANDY might give more info with S and D.

But let's check if SANDY is allowed - yes, it's a valid 5-letter word.

Alternatively, PLANT - but A is at position 3 which is invalid.
BLAND - A at 3 - invalid.
PANTS - A at 2, N at 3 - valid.

I'll go with SANDY as it covers S, A, N, D, Y - giving info on 3 new letters while keeping A and N in allowable positions.

Wait, N is at position 3 in SANDY which is allowed (only position 4 is forbidden for N). A is at position 2 which is allowed (only position 3 is forbidden for A).

But is SANDY the best? Maybe TANGY - T, A, N, G, Y. A at 2, N at 3. Works.

Actually, SANDY is better because D is common and hasn't been tested yet.

- S, D, Y are not in the word.

Word structure: _ A N _ _

Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, S, D, Y
