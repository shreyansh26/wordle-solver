For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of possibilities. This is a good strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ROAST
- IRATE

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

These letters should provide good feedback about the presence of common letters in the secret word.

The first guess “SLATE” gave us:

S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

- E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are all absent.

That eliminates a lot of letters.  
To maximize the information gained from the next guess, we want:
1. To keep the known-good letter E, but move it out of the last spot.
2. To introduce as many new, common letters as possible, especially ones that weren’t in SLATE.

Good next-step “discover” words that use E elsewhere and bring in fresh consonants include:

- CRONE – C, R, O, N, E
- PRONE – P, R, O, N, E
- CHORE – C, H, O, R, E
- GRIPE – G, R, I, P, E
- CRIME – C, R, I, M, E

“CRONE” stands out because it adds C, R, O, N—four high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet—while re-using E in position 4. It’s a balanced probe that should efficiently narrow down the possibilities.

Current knowledge:

  – O is in the word and is **correctly placed in position 2**.
  – E is in the word and **not in position 5**.
  – N is in the word and **not in position 4**.

So we have the pattern: _ O _ _ _ with additional letters E and N to fit somewhere else.

Also, the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters we have not tried yet. The still-untried common letters include: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We know:
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be in 5)
- N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 2 is already O, so 1, 3, or 5

Let’s try a word with O in 2nd, and test new letters while including E and N in possible slots. A good probe word would be “GONER”:
- G (new letter)
- O (correctly placed)
- N (new position 3)
- E (new position 4)
- R (already ruled out — oops, cannot use)

Better candidate: “BONED”:

- E (in position 4 – allowed)

“BONED” fits all constraints:
- Uses only allowed letters.

- Adds two new common letters (B, D).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is a good strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ROAST
- IRATE

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

These letters should provide good feedback about the presence of common letters in the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess “SLATE” gave us:

S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

- E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are all absent.

That eliminates a lot of letters.  
To maximize the information gained from the next guess, we want:
1. To keep the known-good letter E, but move it out of the last spot.
2. To introduce as many new, common letters as possible, especially ones that weren’t in SLATE.

Good next-step “discover” words that use E elsewhere and bring in fresh consonants include:

- CRONE – C, R, O, N, E
- PRONE – P, R, O, N, E
- CHORE – C, H, O, R, E
- GRIPE – G, R, I, P, E
- CRIME – C, R, I, M, E

“CRONE” stands out because it adds C, R, O, N—four high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet—while re-using E in position 4. It’s a balanced probe that should efficiently narrow down the possibilities.

So we now know:
- Letters OUT: S, L, A, T, C, R
- Letters IN (somewhere): E, O, N
  – E ≠ 5th
  – O ≠ 3rd
  – N ≠ 4th

We have used only 8 distinct letters across two guesses. We still need to test many other common letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Reuse the known letters E, O, N in new positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, common consonants/vowels we haven’t tested yet.

Candidate “discover” words:
- POUND – introduces P, U, D; keeps O, N; but O would be 2nd (allowed) and N 3rd (allowed). However, P, U, D are all unknown.
- HONEY – introduces H, Y; keeps O, N, E in new spots (O 2nd, N 3rd, E 4th) — all placements are allowed.
- MOUND – introduces M, U, D; keeps O, N.
- WOKEN – introduces W, K; keeps O, E, N in new spots.

“HONEY” looks best because:
- All placements of E, O, N are allowed (E in 4th is fine, O in 2nd is fine, N in 3rd is fine).
- H and Y are common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Summary of current knowledge

Letters OUT: S, L, A, T, C, R, H, Y, B, D  
Letters IN  : O (position 2), E (NOT in 5), N (NOT in 4)

Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd slot.
2. Contains E somewhere in slots 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains N somewhere allowed (1, 3, 5) — but 3 or 5 are open once we place E.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Fresh letters we haven’t tried that are still legal: F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s build a word that places E in slot 3 and N in slot 5, and adds two unused consonants for maximum information:

O in 2  
E in 3  
N in 5  
Slots 1 and 4 still open.

Candidate: P O E N ?  (need a legal 5-letter word)  
“P” unused, “O” fixed, “E” in 3, “N” in 5, so we need a legal letter in 4.  
The only unused common letter for slot 4 that keeps a real word is “K”.

That gives P O E N K → “POKEN” (valid, though uncommon).  
But we can do better with a more common word.

Another candidate: M O N E Y – but Y is out.  
K O N E ? – not valid.  
F O N E ? – not valid.

Try placing E in slot 4 instead:

_ O _ E _  
Now N must go in 1 or 5.

- N O _ E _  → need a 3rd letter.  
   “NOBLE” – B is out.  
   “NOISE” – S is out.  
   “NOGUE” – U,G unused, but “NOGUE” isn’t a standard word.

- _ O _ E N  → the 1st letter must be unused and produce a real word.  
   Possible: “FOREN”, “GOREN” – invalid.  
   “WOKEN” – K, W unused, valid word.

“WOKEN” satisfies:
- Letters used: W, O, K, E, N – all still legal.
- O is in 2 (already ✓).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- N is in 5 (allowed).
- Adds two new consonants (W, K).

Therefore “WOKEN” is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a wide range of possibilities. This is a good strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ROAST
- IRATE

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

These letters should provide good feedback about the presence of common letters in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess “SLATE” gave us:

S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

- E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are all absent.

That eliminates a lot of letters.  
To maximize the information gained from the next guess, we want:
1. To keep the known-good letter E, but move it out of the last spot.
2. To introduce as many new, common letters as possible, especially ones that weren’t in SLATE.

Good next-step “discover” words that use E elsewhere and bring in fresh consonants include:

- CRONE – C, R, O, N, E
- PRONE – P, R, O, N, E
- CHORE – C, H, O, R, E
- GRIPE – G, R, I, P, E
- CRIME – C, R, I, M, E

“CRONE” stands out because it adds C, R, O, N—four high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet—while re-using E in position 4. It’s a balanced probe that should efficiently narrow down the possibilities.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- SLATE: S, L, A, T are not in the word at all. E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.
- CRONE: C, R are not in the word. O, N, E are in the word but NOT in their current positions.

So we now know:
- Letters OUT: S, L, A, T, C, R
- Letters IN (somewhere): E, O, N
  – E ≠ 5th
  – O ≠ 3rd
  – N ≠ 4th

We have used only 8 distinct letters across two guesses. We still need to test many other common letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Reuse the known letters E, O, N in new positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, common consonants/vowels we haven’t tested yet.

Candidate “discover” words:
- POUND – introduces P, U, D; keeps O, N; but O would be 2nd (allowed) and N 3rd (allowed). However, P, U, D are all unknown.
- HONEY – introduces H, Y; keeps O, N, E in new spots (O 2nd, N 3rd, E 4th) — all placements are allowed.
- MOUND – introduces M, U, D; keeps O, N.
- WOKEN – introduces W, K; keeps O, E, N in new spots.

“HONEY” looks best because:
- All placements of E, O, N are allowed (E in 4th is fine, O in 2nd is fine, N in 3rd is fine).
- H and Y are common letters we haven’t tried yet.
- It avoids any letters already ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

Guess 3: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- Letters OUT (never appear): S, L, A, T, C, R, H, Y
- Letters IN (appear somewhere): O, E, N
  – O is in the word and is **correctly placed in position 2**.
  – E is in the word and **not in position 5**.
  – N is in the word and **not in position 4**.

So we have the pattern: _ O _ _ _ with additional letters E and N to fit somewhere else.

Also, the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters we have not tried yet. The still-untried common letters include: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We know:
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be in 5)
- N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 2 is already O, so 1, 3, or 5

Let’s try a word with O in 2nd, and test new letters while including E and N in possible slots. A good probe word would be “GONER”:
- G (new letter)
- O (correctly placed)
- N (new position 3)
- E (new position 4)
- R (already ruled out — oops, cannot use)

Next candidate: “PONED” (but P, D new, N in 3, E in 4) – but ""PONED"" is not a common English word.

Better candidate: “BONED”:
- B (new)
- O (correct)
- N (in position 3 – allowed)
- E (in position 4 – allowed)
- D (new)

“BONED” fits all constraints:
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Places O correctly.
- Places E and N in allowed positions.
- Adds two new common letters (B, D).

Let’s go with BONED.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of current knowledge

Letters OUT: S, L, A, T, C, R, H, Y, B, D  
Letters IN  : O (position 2), E (NOT in 5), N (NOT in 4)

Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd slot.
2. Contains E somewhere in slots 1, 3, or 4.
3. Contains N somewhere allowed (1, 3, 5) — but 3 or 5 are open once we place E.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Fresh letters we haven’t tried that are still legal: F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s build a word that places E in slot 3 and N in slot 5, and adds two unused consonants for maximum information:

O in 2  
E in 3  
N in 5  
Slots 1 and 4 still open.

Candidate: P O E N ?  (need a legal 5-letter word)  
“P” unused, “O” fixed, “E” in 3, “N” in 5, so we need a legal letter in 4.  
The only unused common letter for slot 4 that keeps a real word is “K”.

That gives P O E N K → “POKEN” (valid, though uncommon).  
But we can do better with a more common word.

Another candidate: M O N E Y – but Y is out.  
K O N E ? – not valid.  
F O N E ? – not valid.

Try placing E in slot 4 instead:

_ O _ E _  
Now N must go in 1 or 5.

- N O _ E _  → need a 3rd letter.  
   “NOBLE” – B is out.  
   “NOISE” – S is out.  
   “NOGUE” – U,G unused, but “NOGUE” isn’t a standard word.

- _ O _ E N  → the 1st letter must be unused and produce a real word.  
   Possible: “FOREN”, “GOREN” – invalid.  
   “WOKEN” – K, W unused, valid word.

“WOKEN” satisfies:
- Letters used: W, O, K, E, N – all still legal.
- O is in 2 (already ✓).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- N is in 5 (allowed).
- Adds two new consonants (W, K).

Therefore “WOKEN” is a strong next guess.
