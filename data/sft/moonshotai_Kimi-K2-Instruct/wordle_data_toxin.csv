For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good starting word should contain several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ALERT (A, L, E, R, T)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and giving me good information about both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So:
- Word contains T, but not in position 4.
- S, L, A, E are excluded entirely.
- We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (R, N, H, C, etc.).

I’ll pick a new word that uses T in a different spot and includes fresh high-frequency letters. I’ll avoid S, L, A, E entirely.

A strong next choice is “NORTH”:
- Uses T in position 4 (but from feedback T is not in position 4) → wait, position 4 is already ruled out, so T must go in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- ""NORTH"" has T in position 4 → bad choice.

Next: “TRUNK” → T in 1, R, U, N, K. Uses T in position 1, tests U, R, N, K.

What we now know:

1. Letters in the word and in the correct positions:
   - T is in position 1 (✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - I is in position 4 (✓)

2. So the word looks like: T O _ I _

3. Letters we already know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, C

4. Letters that are in the word but not in their guessed positions:
   - N (tried in position 3 and 4, both marked (-)) → N must be in position 5

5. Therefore, the only remaining letter must be N in position 5.

6. So the only possible word is: T O _ I N, and the blank must be filled with a letter that hasn't been ruled out yet.

7. From the letters we’ve tried and ruled out (S, L, A, E, P, C), the remaining common letters for position 3 could be: R, D, M, etc.

8. The only possible 5-letter word fitting T O _ I N with letters not yet ruled out is: T O R I N (TORIN is a valid variant/name, but not a common 5-letter English word). Next common is: T O W I N (TOWIN isn’t valid).

Wait, actually the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. The only common word fitting T O _ I N is: T O R I N (if we consider proper nouns), but that’s not standard. Another possibility is: T O B I N (also a name, not a standard word).

Let me re-examine: we have T O _ I _. N must appear, and the only remaining position for N is position 5 (since position 3 is still open, and N has been tried in 3 and 4 and marked wrong). So the word must be T O _ I N.

Valid English words: TORIN (name), TOBIN (name), TOGIN (not valid), TOLIN (not valid), TOFIN (not valid), TOGIN (not valid), TOVIN (not valid), TOYIN (name), etc. This seems problematic.

Wait, let me re-express the constraints carefully:

From TONIC feedback:
- T is correct in position 1 (✓)
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- I is correct in position 4 (✓)
- C is not in the word (x)

So the word is: T O _ I _, with N somewhere, and C excluded. The remaining letters must include N, and cannot include S, L, A, E, P, C.

Possible letters left: D, G, H, M, R, U, V, W, Y, etc. (plus N must appear).

The N must go in position 3 or 5 (since it was tried in 3 and 4 in POINT and TONIC respectively and marked wrong).

But in TONIC, N was in position 3 and marked wrong (-), so N cannot be in position 3 either. Thus the only remaining position for N is position 5.

Therefore the word must be: T O _ I N.

Now, what valid 5-letter English words fit T O _ I N?

Looking at common words:
- TORIN (name)
- TOBIN (name)
- TOGIN (invalid)
- TOFIN (invalid)
- TOYIN (invalid)
- TONIN (invalid)
- TOPIN (invalid)
- TOWIN (invalid)

Hmm, this suggests we might have missed a possibility earlier. Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

Wait, let me check the feedback again from TONIC:
- T(✓) O(✓) N(-) I(✓) C(x)

This means:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from TONIC) and NOT in position 4 (from POINT), and NOT in position 1 or 2 (already taken by T and O), so the only remaining position for N is position 5.

Thus the word must be T O _ I N.

Now, what letter can go in position 3? It must be a letter not yet ruled out (not S, L, A, E, P, C), and must form a valid English word.

Valid English word fitting T O _ I N: T O R I N is not a standard word. The only standard word I can think of is TOXIN, but X is a low-frequency letter and we haven't tested it yet.

However, all constraints point to T O _ I N, and TOXIN is a valid word. Let’s try TOXIN.

But wait, let’s verify TOXIN:
- T(✓) O(✓) X(?) I(✓) N(✓)
If TOXIN is correct, then X must be the missing letter in position 3. Since we haven’t tested X yet, and no feedback rules it out, this is plausible.

Therefore, the next logical guess is TOXIN.

But TOXIN hasn’t been guessed yet, and it fits all current constraints.
