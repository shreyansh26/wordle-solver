For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to eliminate or confirm many letters at once. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- Common vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and provides valuable feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word. That means:
- We can immediately drop S, L, A, T, E from consideration.
- We need a fresh set of letters that does not contain any of those five.

To keep learning efficiently, I’ll aim for a word that uses other very common letters: R, I, N, O, C, U, etc. A frequently recommended second guess when SLATE fails entirely is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) because it introduces four new vowels/semivowels plus the common consonant R and N. It gives us good coverage while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Alternative candidates like “CRONY” or “DIMOR” would also work, but “ROUND” is slightly better statistically. So I’ll go with ROUND.

From the feedback so far:

- Letter confirmed correct and in the right position: D in the 5th spot. So our word ends in D.

- Uses the required letters R and O (with R not in position 1, O not in position 2)
- Uses only allowed, untested letters elsewhere

- O is in position 2 (allowed, since previous O was in position 2 and marked wrong position, but new position is okay)

Current constraints:

- Word ends in D (✓ in position 5).  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I.  
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced:  
  – O (must appear, but cannot be in positions 2 or 3).  
  – R (must appear, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 or 5).  
    The only open position for R is therefore position 4.  
- So we know the word looks like: _ _ _ R D  
- O must appear in positions 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,3 from MORID feedback and ROUND feedback).  
  But position 3 is now occupied by R, so O must be in position 1.  
  Therefore the skeleton is: O _ _ R D

Remaining letters allowed (so far unused and not eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and R (already placed).

Need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 2 and 3.  
Good candidates: C, F, H, K, P, V, W.

Pick common consonants that haven’t been tried: C and K give O C K R D – “OCKRD” is not a word.  
Try F and K: O F K R D – “OFKRD” isn’t valid.  
Try C and H: O C H R D – “OCHRD” isn’t valid.  
Try C and Y: O C Y R D – “OCYRD” isn’t valid.  
Try W and O – already used O.  
Try B and R – already used R.

Try H and K: O H K R D – “OHKRD” isn’t a word.  

Wait – let’s list real five-letter words ending in “ORD” that contain O and R in the required spots and only use allowed letters.

Real words that fit O _ _ R D:
- OXFORD – has X and F, but X hasn’t been eliminated, F is allowed.  
- OCHRED – six letters, too long.  
- OCHROID – too long.  
- OCHERED – too long.  
- ORCHID – has I, which is eliminated.  
- OUTRID – has T (eliminated).  
- OXBIRD – has B, I, R, D; I is eliminated.  
- OFFERED – too long.  
- ORDERED – too long.  
- OKRAND – not an English word.  
- OPYORD – not a word.  
- OGYORD – not a word.

Re-examine the constraints carefully:

We have:
O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot), R must be in position 4, D in 5.  
So word is O _ _ R D.

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 3: any of B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for English 5-letter words of the form O??RD with no S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I.

- OCHRD – not a word.  
- OCKRD – not a word.  
- OFKRD – not a word.  
- OBCRD – not a word.  
- OCHRD – not a word.  
- OXFORD – has F, O, R, D; allowed letters: O, X, F, O, R, D. O is okay, R is okay, D is okay. X and F are allowed. So “OXFORD” is a valid English word and meets every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is OXFORD, but it’s six letters. English 5-letter words fitting the pattern are scarce. Let’s double-check:

Five-letter words ending in ORD:  
board, chord, fjord, sword, hoard, gourd, fjord, but all contain banned letters (A, U, S).  
Next:  
OXFORD – too long.  
No five-letter English word fits the constraints. Therefore, I must have mis-inferred the placement of O.

Let me re-examine:

From guess 3 (MORID): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 2 (ROUND): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  
So O cannot be in position 2, but could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
R must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, so only position 4 is left for R.  
So word is: _ _ _ R D with O somewhere in positions 1-3 but not 2.  
Thus possible patterns:  
O _ _ R D (positions 1,4,5)  
_ O _ R D (positions 2,4,5) – but O cannot be in position 2 from feedback, so this is invalid.  
_ _ O R D (positions 3,4,5) – this is valid.

So word is either:
O _ _ R D  (O in 1, R in 4, D in 5) – but we saw no valid 5-letter English word.  
_ _ O R D  (O in 3, R in 4, D in 5).

Let’s try _ _ O R D pattern.  
Letters allowed for positions 1 and 2: any not yet eliminated (not S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I).  
Common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, etc.

Five-letter English words ending in ORD:
board – A banned.  
chord – C, H, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  
fjord – F, J, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  
gourd – U banned.  
hoard – A banned.  
sword – S banned.  
So two valid candidates: CHORD and FJORD.

Between them, CHORD uses C and H (new letters), FJORD uses F and J (new letters). Both are good. CHORD is slightly more common.

So the next guess is CHORD.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, R, D – none of the banned letters appear.  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, was only banned from 2).  
- R is in position 4 (only allowed spot).  
- D is in position 5 (correct).  

This fits all constraints.

<guess>CHORD</guess>",CHORD,"Current constraints:

- Word ends in D (✓ in position 5).  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I.  
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced:  
  – O (must appear, but cannot be in positions 2 or 3).  
  – R (must appear, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 or 5).  
    The only open position for R is therefore position 4.  
- So we know the word looks like: _ _ _ R D  
- O must appear in positions 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,3 from MORID feedback and ROUND feedback).  
  But position 3 is now occupied by R, so O must be in position 1.  
  Therefore the skeleton is: O _ _ R D

Remaining letters allowed (so far unused and not eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and R (already placed).

Need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 2 and 3.  
Good candidates: C, F, H, K, P, V, W.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BROOD,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to eliminate or confirm many letters at once. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- Common vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and provides valuable feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word. That means:
- We can immediately drop S, L, A, T, E from consideration.
- We need a fresh set of letters that does not contain any of those five.

To keep learning efficiently, I’ll aim for a word that uses other very common letters: R, I, N, O, C, U, etc. A frequently recommended second guess when SLATE fails entirely is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) because it introduces four new vowels/semivowels plus the common consonant R and N. It gives us good coverage while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Alternative candidates like “CRONY” or “DIMOR” would also work, but “ROUND” is slightly better statistically. So I’ll go with ROUND.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N
- Letters confirmed present but in wrong positions: R (must be in word, but not first), O (must be in word, but not second)
- Letter confirmed correct and in the right position: D in the 5th spot. So our word ends in D.

We need a five-letter word ending in D, using R and O somewhere other than their previous spots (R not first, O not second), and excluding the banned letters.

Good candidate letters that haven’t been tried yet: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Ends in D
- Uses the required letters R and O (with R not in position 1, O not in position 2)
- Uses only allowed, untested letters elsewhere

One strong candidate is ""MORID"":
- Ends with D: ✓
- Contains O and R: ✓
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since previous O was in position 2 and marked wrong position, but new position is okay)
- R is in position 3 (allowed: not first)
- Uses M and I, which haven’t been tested yet

Another candidate could be ""CORID"", but ""MORID"" gives us fresh letters. Let's go with ""MORID"".

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BROOD,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to eliminate or confirm many letters at once. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- Common vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and provides valuable feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word. That means:
- We can immediately drop S, L, A, T, E from consideration.
- We need a fresh set of letters that does not contain any of those five.

To keep learning efficiently, I’ll aim for a word that uses other very common letters: R, I, N, O, C, U, etc. A frequently recommended second guess when SLATE fails entirely is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) because it introduces four new vowels/semivowels plus the common consonant R and N. It gives us good coverage while avoiding the eliminated letters.

Alternative candidates like “CRONY” or “DIMOR” would also work, but “ROUND” is slightly better statistically. So I’ll go with ROUND.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N
- Letters confirmed present but in wrong positions: R (must be in word, but not first), O (must be in word, but not second)
- Letter confirmed correct and in the right position: D in the 5th spot. So our word ends in D.

We need a five-letter word ending in D, using R and O somewhere other than their previous spots (R not first, O not second), and excluding the banned letters.

Good candidate letters that haven’t been tried yet: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Ends in D
- Uses the required letters R and O (with R not in position 1, O not in position 2)
- Uses only allowed, untested letters elsewhere

One strong candidate is ""MORID"":
- Ends with D: ✓
- Contains O and R: ✓
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since previous O was in position 2 and marked wrong position, but new position is okay)
- R is in position 3 (allowed: not first)
- Uses M and I, which haven’t been tested yet

Another candidate could be ""CORID"", but ""MORID"" gives us fresh letters. Let's go with ""MORID"".

Guess 3: MORID -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) R(-) I(x) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

- Word ends in D (✓ in position 5).  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I.  
- Letters that ARE in the word but are misplaced:  
  – O (must appear, but cannot be in positions 2 or 3).  
  – R (must appear, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 or 5).  
    The only open position for R is therefore position 4.  
- So we know the word looks like: _ _ _ R D  
- O must appear in positions 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,3 from MORID feedback and ROUND feedback).  
  But position 3 is now occupied by R, so O must be in position 1.  
  Therefore the skeleton is: O _ _ R D

Remaining letters allowed (so far unused and not eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and R (already placed).

Need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 2 and 3.  
Good candidates: C, F, H, K, P, V, W.

Pick common consonants that haven’t been tried: C and K give O C K R D – “OCKRD” is not a word.  
Try F and K: O F K R D – “OFKRD” isn’t valid.  
Try C and H: O C H R D – “OCHRD” isn’t valid.  
Try C and Y: O C Y R D – “OCYRD” isn’t valid.  
Try W and O – already used O.  
Try B and R – already used R.  
Try B and Y: O B Y R D – “OBYRD” isn’t a word.  
Try C and O – already used O.  
Try C and Y again – not a word.  
Try F and O – already used O.  
Try K and O – already used O.  
Try B and K: O B K R D – “OBKRD” isn’t a word.  
Try C and K again – not valid.

Try P and Y: O P Y R D – “OPYRD” isn’t a word.  
Try C and K – again, not a word.  
Try B and C: O B C R D – “OBCRD” isn’t a word.  
Try H and K: O H K R D – “OHKRD” isn’t a word.  

Wait – let’s list real five-letter words ending in “ORD” that contain O and R in the required spots and only use allowed letters.

Real words that fit O _ _ R D:
- OXFORD – has X and F, but X hasn’t been eliminated, F is allowed.  
- OCHRED – six letters, too long.  
- OCHROID – too long.  
- OCHERED – too long.  
- ORCHID – has I, which is eliminated.  
- OUTRID – has T (eliminated).  
- OXBIRD – has B, I, R, D; I is eliminated.  
- OFFERED – too long.  
- ORDERED – too long.  
- OKRAND – not an English word.  
- OPYORD – not a word.  
- OGYORD – not a word.

Re-examine the constraints carefully:

We have:
O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot), R must be in position 4, D in 5.  
So word is O _ _ R D.

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 3: any of B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for English 5-letter words of the form O??RD with no S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I.

- OCHRD – not a word.  
- OCKRD – not a word.  
- OFKRD – not a word.  
- OBCRD – not a word.  
- OCHRD – not a word.  
- OXFORD – has F, O, R, D; allowed letters: O, X, F, O, R, D. O is okay, R is okay, D is okay. X and F are allowed. So “OXFORD” is a valid English word and meets every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is OXFORD, but it’s six letters. English 5-letter words fitting the pattern are scarce. Let’s double-check:

Five-letter words ending in ORD:  
board, chord, fjord, sword, hoard, gourd, fjord, but all contain banned letters (A, U, S).  
Next:  
OXFORD – too long.  
No five-letter English word fits the constraints. Therefore, I must have mis-inferred the placement of O.

Let me re-examine:

From guess 3 (MORID): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 2 (ROUND): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  
So O cannot be in position 2, but could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
R must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, so only position 4 is left for R.  
So word is: _ _ _ R D with O somewhere in positions 1-3 but not 2.  
Thus possible patterns:  
O _ _ R D (positions 1,4,5)  
_ O _ R D (positions 2,4,5) – but O cannot be in position 2 from feedback, so this is invalid.  
_ _ O R D (positions 3,4,5) – this is valid.

So word is either:
O _ _ R D  (O in 1, R in 4, D in 5) – but we saw no valid 5-letter English word.  
_ _ O R D  (O in 3, R in 4, D in 5).

Let’s try _ _ O R D pattern.  
Letters allowed for positions 1 and 2: any not yet eliminated (not S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I).  
Common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, etc.

Five-letter English words ending in ORD:
board – A banned.  
chord – C, H, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  
fjord – F, J, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  
gourd – U banned.  
hoard – A banned.  
sword – S banned.  
So two valid candidates: CHORD and FJORD.

Between them, CHORD uses C and H (new letters), FJORD uses F and J (new letters). Both are good. CHORD is slightly more common.

So the next guess is CHORD.

Let me verify:
- C, H, O, R, D – none of the banned letters appear.  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, was only banned from 2).  
- R is in position 4 (only allowed spot).  
- D is in position 5 (correct).  

This fits all constraints.

A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to eliminate or confirm many letters at once. \n\nThe word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:\n- Common vowels: A and E\n- Common consonants: S, L, T\n\nThis gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and provides valuable feedback for narrowing down future guesses.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word. That means:\n- We can immediately drop S, L, A, T, E from consideration.\n- We need a fresh set of letters that does not contain any of those five.\n\nTo keep learning efficiently, I’ll aim for a word that uses other very common letters: R, I, N, O, C, U, etc. A frequently recommended second guess when SLATE fails entirely is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D) because it introduces four new vowels/semivowels plus the common consonant R and N. It gives us good coverage while avoiding the eliminated letters.\n\nAlternative candidates like “CRONY” or “DIMOR” would also work, but “ROUND” is slightly better statistically.

O is okay, R is okay, D is okay. X and F are allowed. So “OXFORD” is a valid English word and meets every constraint.\n\nTherefore, the next logical guess is OXFORD, but it’s six letters. English 5-letter words fitting the pattern are scarce. Let’s double-check:\n\nFive-letter words ending in ORD:  \nboard, chord, fjord, sword, hoard, gourd, fjord, but all contain banned letters (A, U, S).  \nNext:  \nOXFORD – too long.  \nNo five-letter English word fits the constraints. Therefore, I must have mis-inferred the placement of O.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\nFrom guess 3 (MORID): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  \nFrom guess 2 (ROUND): O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.  \nSo O cannot be in position 2, but could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  \nR must be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, so only position 4 is left for R.  \nSo word is: _ _ _ R D with O somewhere in positions 1-3 but not 2.  \nThus possible patterns:  \nO _ _ R D (positions 1,4,5)  \n_ O _ R D (positions 2,4,5) – but O cannot be in position 2 from feedback, so this is invalid.  \n_ _ O R D (positions 3,4,5) – this is valid.\n\nSo word is either:\nO _ _ R D  (O in 1, R in 4, D in 5) – but we saw no valid 5-letter English word.  \n_ _ O R D  (O in 3, R in 4, D in 5).\n\nLet’s try _ _ O R D pattern.  \nLetters allowed for positions 1 and 2: any not yet eliminated (not S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I).  \nCommon consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, etc.\n\nFive-letter English words ending in ORD:\nboard – A banned.  \nchord – C, H, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  \nfjord – F, J, O, R, D – letters all allowed.  \ngourd – U banned.  \nhoard – A banned.  \nsword – S banned.  \nSo two valid candidates: CHORD and FJORD.\n\nBetween them, CHORD uses C and H (new letters), FJORD uses F and J (new letters). Both are good. CHORD is slightly more common.\n\nSo the next guess is CHORD.\n\nLet me verify:\n- C, H, O, R, D – none of the banned letters appear.  \n- O is in position 3 (allowed, was only banned from 2).  \n- R is in position 4 (only allowed spot).  \n- D is in position 5 (correct).  \n\nThis fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>CHORD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(✓)\nGuess 3: MORID -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) R(-) I(x) D(✓)\nGuess 4: CHORD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(-) D(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n\n- The word ends in D and has D in the 5th position.  \n- O is confirmed in the 3rd position.  \n- R is confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,5.

Current constraints:

- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, M, I, C, H, F, J  
- Confirmed positions:  
  – O is fixed at the 3rd position (✓)  
  – D is fixed at the 5th position (✓)  
  – R must appear somewhere, but feedback on every guess shows R is “-” (wrong position).  
    Checking positions tried:  
      – ROUND: R in 1st → wrong  
      – MORID: R in 3rd → wrong  
      – CHORD: R in 4th → wrong  
      – FJORD: R in 4th → wrong  
    The only remaining position R has **never** occupied is the 2nd.  
    Therefore R must be in position 2.

So the word skeleton is: _ R O _ D

Available letters for positions 1 and 4 (must be unused and ≠ each other):  
B, G, K, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Real 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ D:

- BROOD – O already used in 3rd, D fixed, but O appears twice → allowed (D is 5th).  
- BROID – I eliminated.  
- GROUD – U eliminated.  
- PROUD – U eliminated.  
- GROGD – not a word.  
- BROOD is the only valid English word that fits and uses allowed letters.

Check letters: B, R, O, O, D  
All letters allowed; R and O are required; D is required; B and the second O are new and allowed.

Therefore next guess is BROOD.
