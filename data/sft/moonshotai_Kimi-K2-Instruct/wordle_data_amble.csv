For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me good coverage of common letters that might appear in the secret word, helping me quickly identify which letters are present and which positions they might occupy.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct fifth position.
- R, O, S are NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ _ E

Letters left to try should contain common consonants and possibly the remaining vowels U, I (since A and E are already placed).

Good choices to test next might include:
- T (very common)
- N (common)
- L (common)
- I or U (remaining vowels)
- C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced word that tests several of these is ""ANIME"". It has:
- A (already known to be first)
- N (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- M (new consonant)
- E (already known to be fifth)

This should give us good information about N, I, M while maintaining the known positions of A and E.
