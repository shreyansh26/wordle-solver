2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices because they cover common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R, O, S, E are all absent.

So the secret word:
- has an A somewhere other than position 1
- does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

That leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y to work with, and the vowels I and U (since A is already confirmed present, and O, E are eliminated).

Since A must appear in positions 2-5, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes A (but not at start)
2. Avoids R, O, S, E
3. Uses other common consonants to test new letters.

A good candidate: ""FAINT""
- F, N, T are common consonants not yet ruled out.
- I and A are the remaining vowels to test.
- A appears in position 3, satisfying the feedback.
- F, I, N, T are all still possible letters.

Summary of what we now know:
- A is in position 2 (because in FAINT, A got ✓ at position 2).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because T got “-” at position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, F, I, N.
- Letters still allowed: A (already placed in position 2), plus B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T somewhere other than position 5.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 1: any consonant except F, R, S
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: any consonant except N, R, S
- Position 4: any consonant except N, R, S
- Position 5: any consonant except E, N, S, T

And T must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

A good next guess should:
1. Fix the A in position 2.
2. Test new consonants.
3. Place T in a new position (1–4) to learn where it fits.

Word that satisfies:
B A T _ _  — need two more consonants, avoiding forbidden set.
Try B A T C H:
- B and C are new letters, H is new.
- T is in position 3 (valid).
- All letters used are from the allowed set.

Check constraints:
- B (allowed), A (fixed), T (allowed), C (allowed), H (allowed) ✔
- No forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, F, I, N are absent ✔
- T not in position 5 ✔

Hence, BATCH is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R, O, S, E are all absent.

So the secret word:
- has an A somewhere other than position 1
- does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

That leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y to work with, and the vowels I and U (since A is already confirmed present, and O, E are eliminated).

Since A must appear in positions 2-5, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes A (but not at start)
2. Avoids R, O, S, E
3. Uses other common consonants to test new letters.

A good candidate: ""FAINT""

- Letters still allowed: A (already placed in position 2), plus B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T somewhere other than position 5.

So the pattern so far:

- Position 3: any consonant except N, R, S
- Position 4: any consonant except N, R, S
- Position 5: any consonant except E, N, S, T

And T must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

A good next guess should:
1. Fix the A in position 2.
2. Test new consonants.
3. Place T in a new position (1–4) to learn where it fits.

B A T _ _  — need two more consonants, avoiding forbidden set.
Try B A T C H:
- B and C are new letters, H is new.

Another good candidate is “PATCH,” but again P hasn’t been tested.  
A third possibility is “LATCH,” which is also common.

Let’s go with LATCH—L is a frequent starting letter and hasn’t been ruled out.

So the guess: L A T C H

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Known pattern so far:
- Position 2 = A ✓
- Position 3 = T ✓
- Position 4 = C ✓
- Position 5 = H ✓
- Position 1 must be one of the consonants **not yet eliminated**: D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Letters already eliminated from the word: R, O, S, E, F, I, N, B, L.

The only remaining common first-letter choices for the pattern _ATCH are:
- D (DAT**CH** → not an English word)
- G (GATCH is obsolete slang – unlikely)
- K (KATCH – only a variant spelling, not standard)
- M (MATCH – very common)
- P (PATCH – very common)
- Y (YATCH – not standard)

Between MATCH and PATCH, both are perfectly valid. Since we have two guesses left and need to disambiguate between M and P, I’ll pick MATCH first; if that’s wrong, the next guess will automatically be PATCH.

Hence: MATCH.
