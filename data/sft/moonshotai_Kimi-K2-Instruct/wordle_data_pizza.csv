For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five vowels and the common letter S, giving maximum coverage of common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers nearly all vowels and the letter S, which should provide valuable feedback regardless of the secret word.

The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.  
- The letters R, O, S, E are eliminated.  

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Good remaining frequent letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, Y, etc.

A strong second guess that does this is ""UNTIL"":
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant
- Also places A in position 4 if it were there, but since A isn’t in UNTIL, we’re testing other letters instead.

Another solid choice is ""FAINT"":
- F, I, N, T are new letters, A is in position 2 (not 1), and we avoid R, O, S, E.

I'll go with ""FAINT"" to test the letter A in position 2 along with common new letters.

Possible positions left for A: 4 or 5  
Possible positions left for I: 1, 4, 5 (but not conflicting with A)

A strong next word should:
1. Place A in 4 or 5.
2. Place I in 1, 4, 5 (whichever is free).
3. Introduce two or three new, high-frequency consonants.

Let’s stop forcing Y. Try “BAIRD” – R out.

Next best that fits: “DIAKY” – not a word.  
“PIVOT” – O out.

Case 2: I in 4, A in 5 → pattern _ _ _ I A

Let me list every 5-letter word that uses only letters from {A, I} plus {B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y} and keeps A, I in 4 & 5 (either order):

Real words that fit:

But let’s find a better known word.

Real common word: “HAPAI” – not common.  
“BIPAY” – not a word.  
“GAPIA” – no.

Actually “PAGIA” – no.

Let’s rethink: maybe A is 5, I is 1.  
Then pattern I _ _ _ A.

Try consonants: B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Real word: “VILLA” – L out.  
“WILDA” – L out.  
“BINGO” – O out, N out.  
“BILGA” – not common.  
“PIKIA” – no.

Next real word: “KIPPA” (Jewish skullcap) – K, I, P, P, A – valid English word, fits constraints: uses K, I, P, A (A at 5, I at 2), avoids all forbidden letters.

So pattern I _ _ _ A: KIPPA – positions K I P P A.

That uses K, I, P, P, A.  
All letters are allowed; A is in 5 (new), I is in 2 (new).  
Introduces K and P (new).

Thus “KIPPA” satisfies every constraint.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,pizza,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five vowels and the common letter S, giving maximum coverage of common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers nearly all vowels and the letter S, which should provide valuable feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.  
- The letters R, O, S, E are eliminated.  

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Good remaining frequent letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, Y, etc.

A strong second guess that does this is ""UNTIL"":
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant
- Also places A in position 4 if it were there, but since A isn’t in UNTIL, we’re testing other letters instead.

Another solid choice is ""FAINT"":
- F, I, N, T are new letters, A is in position 2 (not 1), and we avoid R, O, S, E.

I'll go with ""FAINT"" to test the letter A in position 2 along with common new letters.

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (since it was marked “-” in both guesses).
- R, O, S, E, F, N, T are NOT present at all.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was “-” in position 3 in FAINT).

Letters we can still use: A (positions 3, 4, or 5), I (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) plus other unused common letters such as L, C, D, U, Y, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.
2. Places I in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. Adds two or three new common consonants that we haven’t tried yet.

Good candidates: DAILY, CLAIM, VICAR, PLAID, HABIT.

Let’s pick “CLAIM”:
- C, L, M are new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five vowels and the common letter S, giving maximum coverage of common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers nearly all vowels and the letter S, which should provide valuable feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.  
- The letters R, O, S, E are eliminated.  

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Good remaining frequent letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, Y, etc.

A strong second guess that does this is ""UNTIL"":
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant
- Also places A in position 4 if it were there, but since A isn’t in UNTIL, we’re testing other letters instead.

Another solid choice is ""FAINT"":
- F, I, N, T are new letters, A is in position 2 (not 1), and we avoid R, O, S, E.

I'll go with ""FAINT"" to test the letter A in position 2 along with common new letters.

<guess>FAINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (since it was marked “-” in both guesses).
- R, O, S, E, F, N, T are NOT present at all.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was “-” in position 3 in FAINT).

Letters we can still use: A (positions 3, 4, or 5), I (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) plus other unused common letters such as L, C, D, U, Y, B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.
2. Places I in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. Adds two or three new common consonants that we haven’t tried yet.

Good candidates: DAILY, CLAIM, VICAR, PLAID, HABIT.

Let’s pick “CLAIM”:
- C, L, M are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (new slot).
- I is in position 2 (new slot).

This tests five brand-new letters while respecting all previous constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Letters we KNOW are in the word (but still don’t know their exact spots)
- A (cannot be positions 1, 2, or 3)
- I (cannot be positions 2 or 3)

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word
R, O, S, E, F, N, T, C, L, M

Remaining common unused letters: B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y plus A and I.

Possible positions left for A: 4 or 5  
Possible positions left for I: 1, 4, 5 (but not conflicting with A)

A strong next word should:
1. Place A in 4 or 5.
2. Place I in 1, 4, 5 (whichever is free).
3. Introduce two or three new, high-frequency consonants.

Good candidates:  
- DAIRY – D, R, Y (but R is already out)  
- BHAJI – uses B, H, J (but J is uncommon)  
- VAPID – V, P, D (but D is fine)  
- HABIT – H, B, T (but T is out)  
- PIVOT – P, V, O, T (but O and T are out)  
- BIPAD – B, P, D (but D is fine)

The best remaining seems BIPAD, but that’s not a common word.  
Better is “VIHAD” (still obscure).  
Let’s go for “PIVOT” is no good (O, T out).  
Back to basics: stick to real, common words.

How about “HAIRY”:
- H, R, Y – but R already out.  
“DAIRY” – R out.  
“PAIDY” – not a word.  
“DAISY” – S out.

Let’s stop forcing Y. Try “BAIRD” – R out.  
“BHAJI” – not common.

Best common word that fits constraints: “DAIRY” but R is out.  
Next best that fits: “DIAKY” – not a word.  
“PIVOT” – O out.  
“VAPID” – P, V, D left; uses A in 3 (but A can’t be 3).  
“VALID” – L out.

Let’s list usable letters left: A, I, B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to use A in 4 or 5, I in 1, 4, 5 non-conflict.

Candidate: “BIVID” – not common  
“BIPAD” – not common  
“VAPID” – A must be 3 (invalid)  
“HAIRY” – A must be 2 (invalid)  
“PIVOT” – O out  
“WIPAD” – not a word  

Real common word: “DIVVY” – uses D, V, V, Y; A missing.

We must include A and I.  
A must be 4 or 5, I must be 1, 4, 5 without overlap.

So the two letters A and I must occupy positions 4 and 5 in either order.

Case 1: A in 4, I in 5 → pattern _ _ _ A I  
Case 2: I in 4, A in 5 → pattern _ _ _ I A  

Pick three new consonants from B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Case 1 (_ _ _ A I) – need three consonants.  
Try B, D, H → “BDHAI” – not a word  
P, U, B → “PUBAI” – no  
H, U, G → “HUGAI” – no  
K, Y, D → “KYDAI” – no  

Case 2 (_ _ _ I A) – same issue.

Real words:  
“MEDIA” – M out, E? unknown, but M is out.  
“VICIA” – C out.  
“VIBIA” – doesn’t exist.  
“HIDIA” – doesn’t exist.

We’re left with a very small pool.

Let me list every 5-letter word that uses only letters from {A, I} plus {B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y} and keeps A, I in 4 & 5 (either order):

Real words that fit:
- KIVIA – not in dictionary.  
- PIVIA – no.  
- WIKIA – no.  
- PAPIA – P, P, I, A – but A at 4, I at 5 fits.

Wait, “PAPIA” (plural of papia) is a valid English word (though obscure).

But let’s find a better known word.

Real common word: “HAPAI” – not common.  
“BIPAY” – not a word.  
“GAPIA” – no.

Actually “PAGIA” – no.

Let’s rethink: maybe A is 5, I is 1.  
Then pattern I _ _ _ A.

Try consonants: B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Real word: “VILLA” – L out.  
“WILDA” – L out.  
“BINGO” – O out, N out.  
“BILGA” – not common.  
“PIKIA” – no.

Next real word: “KIPPA” (Jewish skullcap) – K, I, P, P, A – valid English word, fits constraints: uses K, I, P, A (A at 5, I at 2), avoids all forbidden letters.

So pattern I _ _ _ A: KIPPA – positions K I P P A.

That uses K, I, P, P, A.  
All letters are allowed; A is in 5 (new), I is in 2 (new).  
Introduces K and P (new).

Thus “KIPPA” satisfies every constraint.

""WIDDA"" – not a word.

Real word: ""HIDDA"" – not a word.  
""BIGGA"" – not a word.  
""DIGIA"" – not a word.

Real common word: ""VIGIA"" – obscure but valid.  
However, we need to use common words.

Actually, let's list all valid 5-letter English words fitting _ I _ _ A with letters only from allowed set.

Allowed: B, D, G, H, U, V, W, Y plus I (pos 2) and A (pos 5).

Possible combinations:

- B I D Y A → ""BIDYA"" – not a word.  
- B I G Y A → ""BIGYA"" – not a word.  
- D I G Y A → ""DIGYA"" – not a word.  
- H I G H A → ""HIGHA"" – not a word.  
- V I V A A – not valid.  
- V I D Y A → ""VIDYA"" – valid word (from Sanskrit origin, used in English).

""VIDYA"" fits all constraints:
- V, I, D, Y, A
- I is 2nd letter (✓), A is 5th letter (✓)
- All letters are unused and allowed.

Thus, the best next guess is ""VIDYA"".

From all feedback:
- Positions we know for sure:
  2nd letter = I
  5th letter = A
  So the pattern is: _ I _ _ A

- Letters that are definitely OUT (x-feedback):
  R, O, S, E, F, N, T, C, L, M, K, P, V, D, Y

- Allowed unused letters left:
  B, G, H, U, W

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with any combination of those five letters (B, G, H, U, W) to form a valid English word matching _ I _ _ A.

Possible words:
- BI-G-A shapes:
  BIGGA – uses G twice; not valid
  BINGA – N is out
  BILGA – L is out
- HI-G-A shapes:
  HIGGA – G twice, not valid
  HINGA – N is out
- GUI-A shapes:
  GUI-A – no 3rd letter
- WIG-A shapes:
  WIGWA – not a word
  WINGA – N is out
- BI-?-HA shapes:
  BI-H-A – no 3rd letter
- Combine B, G, H, U, W:
  BIG-A needs two more letters → BIGWA – not a word
  BUG-A needs two more → BUGIA – I already used in position 2, but new I is not allowed in 3 or 4
  HUGIA – not a word
  BU-G-H-A → BUGHA – not a word
  BHUGA – not a word
  WIGUA – not a word
  WUHIA – not a word
  …

Actually, the only valid English word with pattern _ I _ _ A using only B, G, H, U, W in the blanks is:
B I G G A  → “BIGGA” is not an accepted word
B I G H A  → “BIGHA” is a legitimate English word (a South Asian unit of land)

All letters B, I, G, H, A are allowed (none of them are in the forbidden list), and it respects the known positions I(2) and A(5).

Therefore, the final remaining possibility is “BIGHA”.
