For the first guess, I want to pick a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good information about the presence/absence and positioning of these letters in the secret word.

The feedback from RAISE:
- R : not in the word (x)
- A : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- I : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S : not in the word (x)
- E : not in the word (x)

Take-aways:
1. The letters R, S, and E are completely ruled out.
2. The letters A and I are somewhere in the word, but not in their guessed positions (positions 2 and 3 respectively).
3. We still need to place A and I in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5) and fill the other two slots with letters that haven’t been eliminated and that are common.

Good letters to keep testing: A, I  
Letters definitely excluded: R, S, E  
Letters still unknown: the other 21 letters minus the ruled-out ones.

A solid second guess should:
- keep A and I but move them to new candidate positions.
- use fresh, high-frequency consonants (like T, N, L, C, etc.) to gather more information.

One efficient choice is “TACIT”:
- T and C are high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested.
- A is moved to position 2 (allowed because position 2 was its original “wrong” place, but we can still test it elsewhere).
- I is moved to position 3 (but wait, that was its original position, so it would get the same “wrong position” feedback).  
Better: place I in position 1 or 5, and A in the remaining free slot.

Let’s try “TACIT” but swap A and I placements:  
“TACIT” has I in position 3 again → sub-optimal.

Instead, choose “PLAIT”:
- P, L: new consonants.
- A: position 3 (originally was 2, so new).
- I: position 2 (originally was 3, so new).
- T: new consonant.

That seems balanced. Another quick check confirms all letters not yet ruled out.

However, for even better positional coverage, let’s use “PLANT”:

So A cannot be in 2; must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Letters OUT: R, S, E, D, M, T  
Letters IN but position unknown: A, I

We need a 5-letter word that uses A and I (still not in their correct spots) plus three fresh consonants from the remaining alphabet (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

From the feedback:
- In ADMIT, A was in position 1 and was marked “-” (wrong position), so A cannot be in position 1.
- In RAISE, A was in position 2 and was also “-”, so A cannot be in position 2.
- Therefore A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

- In ADMIT, I was in position 5 and was “-”, so I cannot be in position 5.
- In RAISE, I was in position 3 and was “-”, so I cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that puts A in a new candidate spot (say position 3) and I in a new candidate spot (say position 2) and introduces three unused, common consonants.

Good common consonants still available: C, L, N, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A candidate word: “CLAIN”
- C, L, N: new consonants
- A in position 3
- I in position 2

Check: all letters are still allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- R (very common consonant)

This combination should provide good information about the presence/absence and positioning of these letters in the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from RAISE:
- R : not in the word (x)
- A : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- I : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S : not in the word (x)
- E : not in the word (x)

Take-aways:
1. The letters R, S, and E are completely ruled out.
2. The letters A and I are somewhere in the word, but not in their guessed positions (positions 2 and 3 respectively).
3. We still need to place A and I in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5) and fill the other two slots with letters that haven’t been eliminated and that are common.

Good letters to keep testing: A, I  
Letters definitely excluded: R, S, E  
Letters still unknown: the other 21 letters minus the ruled-out ones.

A solid second guess should:
- keep A and I but move them to new candidate positions.
- use fresh, high-frequency consonants (like T, N, L, C, etc.) to gather more information.

One efficient choice is “TACIT”:
- T and C are high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested.
- A is moved to position 2 (allowed because position 2 was its original “wrong” place, but we can still test it elsewhere).
- I is moved to position 3 (but wait, that was its original position, so it would get the same “wrong position” feedback).  
Better: place I in position 1 or 5, and A in the remaining free slot.

Let’s try “TACIT” but swap A and I placements:  
“TACIT” has I in position 3 again → sub-optimal.

Instead, choose “PLAIT”:
- P, L: new consonants.
- A: position 3 (originally was 2, so new).
- I: position 2 (originally was 3, so new).
- T: new consonant.

That seems balanced. Another quick check confirms all letters not yet ruled out.

However, for even better positional coverage, let’s use “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T: fresh consonants.
- A: position 2 again → same as first guess, which was marked “wrong position”.  
So A cannot be in 2; must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s instead pick “ADMIT”:
- A in 1, I in 5, and the consonants D, M, T newly introduced.

That covers fresh letters and moves A and I to new candidate positions.

I’ll go with ADMIT.

From all feedback so far:

Letters OUT: R, S, E, D, M, T, C, L, N, B, G, H  
Letters KNOWN to be IN and their positions:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
_  I  _  _  A

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 using letters that are:
- NOT in the banned list above  
- NOT yet tested (so far all consonants used: B,C,D,G,H,L,M,N,R,S,T)

Remaining, unused letters include vowels: O, U  
Remaining, unused consonants: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The remaining pool is pretty small. We need two consonants and one vowel (or three consonants if the word has no other vowels) to fit an English word of the form ? I ? ? A.

Looking for common patterns:
- F could fit in position 1 or 3 or 4.

- K I O W A → K, I, O, W, A: “KIOWA” is a valid proper noun (a Native American people). In some word lists it is accepted as a 5-letter word. Let’s accept it here.

KIOWA uses:
- K (new, unused)
- I (correct position)
- O (new vowel, unused)
- W (new, unused)
- A (correct position)

No letters conflict with banned set.

So KIOWA is a valid guess.

Letters OUT: R, S, E, D, M, T, C, L, N, B, G, H  
Letters KNOWN to be IN and their positions:

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,pizza,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to pick a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good information about the presence/absence and positioning of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from RAISE:
- R : not in the word (x)
- A : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- I : in the word, but wrong position (-)
- S : not in the word (x)
- E : not in the word (x)

Take-aways:
1. The letters R, S, and E are completely ruled out.
2. The letters A and I are somewhere in the word, but not in their guessed positions (positions 2 and 3 respectively).
3. We still need to place A and I in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5) and fill the other two slots with letters that haven’t been eliminated and that are common.

Good letters to keep testing: A, I  
Letters definitely excluded: R, S, E  
Letters still unknown: the other 21 letters minus the ruled-out ones.

A solid second guess should:
- keep A and I but move them to new candidate positions.
- use fresh, high-frequency consonants (like T, N, L, C, etc.) to gather more information.

One efficient choice is “TACIT”:
- T and C are high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested.
- A is moved to position 2 (allowed because position 2 was its original “wrong” place, but we can still test it elsewhere).
- I is moved to position 3 (but wait, that was its original position, so it would get the same “wrong position” feedback).  
Better: place I in position 1 or 5, and A in the remaining free slot.

Let’s try “TACIT” but swap A and I placements:  
“TACIT” has I in position 3 again → sub-optimal.

Instead, choose “PLAIT”:
- P, L: new consonants.
- A: position 3 (originally was 2, so new).
- I: position 2 (originally was 3, so new).
- T: new consonant.

That seems balanced. Another quick check confirms all letters not yet ruled out.

However, for even better positional coverage, let’s use “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T: fresh consonants.
- A: position 2 again → same as first guess, which was marked “wrong position”.  
So A cannot be in 2; must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s instead pick “ADMIT”:
- A in 1, I in 5, and the consonants D, M, T newly introduced.

That covers fresh letters and moves A and I to new candidate positions.

I’ll go with ADMIT.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters OUT: R, S, E, D, M, T  
Letters IN but position unknown: A, I

We need a 5-letter word that uses A and I (still not in their correct spots) plus three fresh consonants from the remaining alphabet (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

From the feedback:
- In ADMIT, A was in position 1 and was marked “-” (wrong position), so A cannot be in position 1.
- In RAISE, A was in position 2 and was also “-”, so A cannot be in position 2.
- Therefore A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

- In ADMIT, I was in position 5 and was “-”, so I cannot be in position 5.
- In RAISE, I was in position 3 and was “-”, so I cannot be in position 3.
- Therefore I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that puts A in a new candidate spot (say position 3) and I in a new candidate spot (say position 2) and introduces three unused, common consonants.

Good common consonants still available: C, L, N, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A candidate word: “CLAIN”
- C, L, N: new consonants
- A in position 3
- I in position 2

Check: all letters are still allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated constraints from all feedback so far:

Letters OUT (never appear in the word):
R, S, E, D, M, T, C, L, N

Letters IN (must appear, but positions still unknown):
A, I

Positions ruled out for A:
- Position 2 (from RAISE)
- Position 1 (from ADMIT)
- Position 3 (from CLAIN)
So A must be in position 4 or 5.

Positions ruled out for I:
- Position 3 (from RAISE)
- Position 5 (from ADMIT)
- Position 4 (from CLAIN)
So I must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses both A and I.
2. Places A in position 4 or 5.
3. Places I in position 1 or 2.
4. Introduces three new consonants (from the remaining unused letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try A in position 4 and I in position 2, filling the other spots with common unused consonants.

Candidate word: ""BIGHA""
- B, G, H: fresh consonants
- I in position 2
- A in position 4

Check validity: ""BIGHA"" is a valid 5-letter English word (variant spelling of bigha, a unit of area). All letters comply with constraints.

Remaining unused vowels: U (the only English vowel left)

We need a 5-letter English word matching ? I ? ? A with the only available vowel U and any two of the remaining consonants.

Possible combinations:

1. F I U ? A – but we’d need a consonant in position 4.
   - FIULA? Not a word.
   - FIURA? Not a word.

2. J I U ? A
   - JIUCA? Not valid.
   - JIUMA? Contains M (banned).

3. P I U ? A
   - PIUFA? Not valid.
   - PIUCA? C is banned.
   - PIUJA? J is allowed.
   - But PIUJA doesn’t seem to be a valid English word.

4. V I U ? A

8. P I ? ? A
   - PIZZA? Ends with A, but has two Z’s and an extra A? No, A is fixed at end.
   - PIANO? But O is banned.

Wait, let’s systematically list remaining consonants: F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4, with U in position 3, as U is the only remaining vowel.

So pattern: ? I U ? A

Possible consonants for pos 1: F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Possible consonants for pos 4: same set, but must be distinct from pos 1 unless double letters (unlikely).

Let’s try:

- P I U V A → PIUVA? Not a valid word.
- P I U J A → PIUJA? Not a word.
- P I U Z A → PIUZA? Not a word.
- V I U P A → VIUPA? Not a word.
- F I U P A → FIUPA? Not a word.
- P I U F A → PIUFA? Not valid.
- P I U Q A → PIUQA? Not valid.
- P I U X A → PIUXA? Not valid.
- V I U J A → VIUJA? Not valid.
- F I U Z A → FIUZA? Not valid.
- P I U Y A → PIUYA? Not valid.

Hmm, all seem invalid. Maybe U is not in position 3.

Alternative approach: maybe the word has no other vowel, just I and A. Then positions 1,3,4 must be consonants, one of which could be repeated.

But we have only F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z left.

Possible pattern: ? I ? ? A with three consonants from this set.

Let’s try:

- P I V A ? – no, A is fixed at 5.
- P I X Y A → PIXYA? Not a word.
- P I Z Z A → PIZZA! This is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- P, Z not yet used.
- I in position 2, A in position 5.
- No banned letters.

   - PIUCA? C is banned.
   - PIUJA? J is allowed.
   - But PIUJA doesn’t seem to be a valid English word.

4. V I U ? A
   - VIULA? Not valid.
   - VIUCA? C banned.
   - VIUVA? Double V is unlikely.

5. P I V ? A
   - PIVIA? Not a word.
   - PIVOT? Ends with T (banned).

6. F I V ? A
   - FIVIA? Not a word.

7. P I J ? A
   - PIJAU? Not a word.

8. P I ? ? A
   - PIZZA? Ends with A, but has two Z’s and an extra A? No, A is fixed at end.
   - PIANO? But O is banned.

Wait, let’s systematically list remaining consonants: F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4, with U in position 3, as U is the only remaining vowel.

So pattern: ? I U ? A

Possible consonants for pos 1: F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Possible consonants for pos 4: same set, but must be distinct from pos 1 unless double letters (unlikely).

Let’s try:

- P I U V A → PIUVA? Not a valid word.
- P I U J A → PIUJA? Not a word.
- P I U Z A → PIUZA? Not a word.
- V I U P A → VIUPA? Not a word.
- F I U P A → FIUPA? Not a word.
- P I U F A → PIUFA? Not valid.
- P I U Q A → PIUQA? Not valid.
- P I U X A → PIUXA? Not valid.
- V I U J A → VIUJA? Not valid.
- F I U Z A → FIUZA? Not valid.
- P I U Y A → PIUYA? Not valid.

Hmm, all seem invalid. Maybe U is not in position 3.

Alternative approach: maybe the word has no other vowel, just I and A. Then positions 1,3,4 must be consonants, one of which could be repeated.

But we have only F, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z left.

Possible pattern: ? I ? ? A with three consonants from this set.

Let’s try:

- P I V A ? – no, A is fixed at 5.
- P I X Y A → PIXYA? Not a word.
- P I Z Z A → PIZZA! This is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- P, Z not yet used.
- I in position 2, A in position 5.
- No banned letters.

Perfect!",Guess 6: PIZZA -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) Z(✓) Z(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
