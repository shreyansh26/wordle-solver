For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
1. It has the common vowels A and E
2. It contains common consonants S, L, and T
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
4. It doesn't have any duplicate letters, giving us more unique feedback

From the feedback on SLATE:

From both guesses:

Letters ruled out:
S, L, A, E, O

Letters known to be in the word but in wrong positions:
T, R, U, N  (all four letters from TROUN are present but misplaced)

So the secret word must contain the set {T, R, U, N} plus one more letter (not S, L, A, E, O).

Positions so far:
- T ≠ 1
- R ≠ 2
- U ≠ 4
- N ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly these four letters plus one other (let’s call it X) chosen from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z (excluding already-eliminated vowels/consonants).

A good next step is to test a word that rearranges T, R, U, N and adds one fresh letter.  
I’ll choose “TRUNK” because:
1. It contains T, R, U, N (all known to be in the word).
2. It adds K (a common consonant we haven’t tried).
3. It moves each of T, R, U, N to new positions compared with TROUN:
   - T now in position 1 (was 1 in TROUN ⇒ still wrong, but we can confirm)
   - R now in position 2 (was 2 in TROUN ⇒ still wrong)
   - U now in position 3 (was 4 in TROUN ⇒ new position)
   - N now in position 4 (was 5 in TROUN ⇒ new position)
   - K is new.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback from TROUN said T is in the word but “-” (wrong spot), so T cannot be first; that would make TRUNK invalid for position 1.  
Therefore, I need a word that keeps T out of position 1.

Let’s instead try “RUNTY”:
- Uses R, U, N, T, and the new letter Y.
- Positions:
  - R in 1 (allowed; was in 2 before)
  - U in 2 (allowed; was in 4 before)
  - N in 3 (allowed; was in 5 before)
  - T in 4 (allowed; was in 1 before)
  - Y new.

But we must ensure Y is permitted (it is).  
Another candidate is “BRUNT” with B as the new letter, placing T in 5.  
Both “RUNTY” and “BRUNT” fit; I’ll choose “BRUNT” because B is a very common consonant.

One more check: we must not have used B, R, U, N, T before.  
- B is new.
- R, U, N, T are known to be in the word.

So the guess is “BRUNT”.

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words.

It contains T, R, U, N (all known to be in the word).\n2. It adds K (a common consonant we haven’t tried).\n3.

Summary of constraints we now have:

Letters definitely in the word (✓): B, N, T  
Letters known to be in the word but misplaced (-): R (was in pos 2,3,4) and U (was in pos 4,2,3)  
Letters ruled out: S, L, A, E, O

Current known pattern (from BRUNT’s feedback):
pos 1: B ✓
pos 5: T ✓
pos 4: N ✓

So the word looks like: B _ _ N T

We still need to place R and U in positions 2 and 3 (order unknown) while respecting their “wrong-position” history:
- R cannot have been in 2 (from TROUN) – but in BRUNT it was in 2 and marked “-”, so it simply can’t be in 2 again.  Position 3 is still open for R.
- U was in 4 (TROUN) and 3 (BRUNT) and marked “-” both times, so it can’t be in 3 or 4.  Position 2 is still open for U.

Therefore the only legal arrangement is:
B  U  R  N  T

Check it’s a valid word: “BURNT”.

That satisfies every constraint.
