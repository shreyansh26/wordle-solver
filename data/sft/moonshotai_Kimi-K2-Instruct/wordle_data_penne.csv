For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Has common letters to maximize information gain
2. Doesn't repeat any letters to test more unique characters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible. A good starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position (the last letter).

So the target word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

Remaining common letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, V, W, Z.

I want another vowel-heavy word to locate any vowels quickly. The vowels not yet ruled out are I and U. Since the last letter is fixed as E and we know no A, O, R, S, a good second guess is one that contains T, N, I, and/or U.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"" because:
- It ends with E (✓ we already know).
- Uses U and I (untested vowels).
- Uses N and T (high-frequency consonants).
- No letters A, R, O, S are present.

This should help reveal which of U, N, T, I are in the word and their positions.

2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I
3. The letter N is somewhere in positions 1-4, but NOT in position 2.

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, and the confirmed N.

We have four empty slots: _ _ _ _ E
We know one of those first four slots must be N, and N ≠ slot 2.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4.

Good consonants left: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: none (all vowels A, E, I, O, U have been tested; only E is present).

So the word has exactly one vowel (the final E) and four consonants, one of which is N.

I’ll construct a guess that tests two more consonants while placing N in a valid spot. Let’s try “CYNGE” (but “CYNGE” is invalid—no such word). A valid word might be “LYNGE” which also fails. Better: “GLYNE” is no good either. 

Instead, a safer route is to pick a common word pattern. We need consonants. Let’s try “NIECE” – but I is ruled out. Next, “DENSE” fits: consonants D and S, but S is out. “PENCE”? P, N, C fit, no forbidden letters, and N is in slot 2 (but we know N cannot be in slot 2). So skip PENCE.

Next: “MENCE” – M, N, C, E. M and C are unused. N is in slot 2 – invalid.

Try N in slot 1: “NUDGE” – U and D are allowed, but U is out. “NUDGE” fails.

N in slot 3: “BENCH” – B, N, C, H. All letters unused so far. N in slot 3 is valid. Word ends in H, not E – fails.

We must end in E. So: “BLEND” – no. “CLONE” – O is out. “FLUTE” – U, T out. “GNOME” – O, M out. “MIDGE” – I, D, G, E. I is out. 

Working within the rules: word must be 5 letters, ends in E, no A,R,O,S,U,T,I, and must include N somewhere in 1-4.

A valid candidate is “GNOME” – no, O is out. “PLUME” – U out. “CHIME” – I out.

Wait – how about “LYNCE”? Not a valid word. A real word fitting is “NUDGE” – but U out. 

Realizing: with vowels exhausted except E, and consonants limited, a valid word is “BLEND” but it lacks N and ends in D. 

Recalculating: list all 5-letter words ending in E with no A,R,O,S,U,T,I and containing N.

A valid dictionary word is “NEWIE” – no, W and E but W not tested, yet I is out. 

“NEVRE” – not valid. 

“BEFNE” – not valid. 

“CENSE” – S out. 

“DENNE” – N in slot 2 (invalid). 

“FENCE” – same, N in slot 2 invalid. 

“HENGE” – H, N, G. N in slot 3 – valid! Letters: H, E, N, G. All unused except E. Ends in E. No forbidden letters.

Perfect guess: “HENGE”.

- E – allowed (position 2)

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, and the confirmed N.

We have four empty slots: _ _ _ _ E
We know one of those first four slots must be N, and N ≠ slot 2.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4.

Good consonants left: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: none (all vowels A, E, I, O, U have been tested; only E is present).

So the word has exactly one vowel (the final E) and four consonants, one of which is N.

I’ll construct a guess that tests two more consonants while placing N in a valid spot. Let’s try “CYNGE” (but “CYNGE” is invalid—no such word). A valid word might be “LYNGE” which also fails. Better: “GLYNE” is no good either. 

Instead, a safer route is to pick a common word pattern. We need consonants. Let’s try “NIECE” – but I is ruled out. Next, “DENSE” fits: consonants D and S, but S is out. “PENCE”? P, N, C fit, no forbidden letters, and N is in slot 2 (but we know N cannot be in slot 2). So skip PENCE.

Next: “MENCE” – M, N, C, E. M and C are unused. N is in slot 2 – invalid.

Try N in slot 1: “NUDGE” – U and D are allowed, but U is out. “NUDGE” fails.

N in slot 3: “BENCH” – B, N, C, H. All letters unused so far. N in slot 3 is valid. Word ends in H, not E – fails.

We must end in E. So: “BLEND” – no. “CLONE” – O is out. “FLUTE” – U, T out. “GNOME” – O, M out. “MIDGE” – I, D, G, E. I is out. 

Working within the rules: word must be 5 letters, ends in E, no A,R,O,S,U,T,I, and must include N somewhere in 1-4.

A valid candidate is “GNOME” – no, O is out. “PLUME” – U out. “CHIME” – I out.

Wait – how about “LYNCE”? Not a valid word. A real word fitting is “NUDGE” – but U out. 

Realizing: with vowels exhausted except E, and consonants limited, a valid word is “BLEND” but it lacks N and ends in D. 

Recalculating: list all 5-letter words ending in E with no A,R,O,S,U,T,I and containing N.

A valid dictionary word is “NEWIE” – no, W and E but W not tested, yet I is out. 

“NEVRE” – not valid. 

“BEFNE” – not valid. 

“CENSE” – S out. 

“DENNE” – N in slot 2 (invalid). 

“FENCE” – same, N in slot 2 invalid. 

“HENGE” – H, N, G. N in slot 3 – valid! Letters: H, E, N, G. All unused except E. Ends in E. No forbidden letters.

Perfect guess: “HENGE”.

Check:
- H – allowed
- E – allowed (position 2)
- N – allowed (position 3)
- G – allowed
- E – allowed (position 5, known correct)

No forbidden letters A,R,O,S,U,T,I appear. N is present and not in position 2. Word is valid.

1. Has common letters to maximize information gain
2. Doesn't repeat any letters to test more unique characters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible. A good starting word would be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position (the last letter).

So the target word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

Remaining common letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, V, W, Z.

I want another vowel-heavy word to locate any vowels quickly. The vowels not yet ruled out are I and U. Since the last letter is fixed as E and we know no A, O, R, S, a good second guess is one that contains T, N, I, and/or U.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"" because:
- It ends with E (✓ we already know).
- Uses U and I (untested vowels).
- Uses N and T (high-frequency consonants).
- No letters A, R, O, S are present.

This should help reveal which of U, N, T, I are in the word and their positions.

Let’s try “CYNGE” (but “CYNGE” is invalid—no such word). A valid word might be “LYNGE” which also fails. Better: “GLYNE” is no good either. \n\nInstead, a safer route is to pick a common word pattern. We need consonants. Let’s try “NIECE” – but I is ruled out. Next, “DENSE” fits: consonants D and S, but S is out. “PENCE”? P, N, C fit, no forbidden letters, and N is in slot 2 (but we know N cannot be in slot 2). So skip PENCE.\n\nNext: “MENCE” – M, N, C, E. M and C are unused. N is in slot 2 – invalid.\n\nTry N in slot 1: “NUDGE” – U and D are allowed, but U is out. “NUDGE” fails.\n\nN in slot 3: “BENCH” – B, N, C, H. All letters unused so far. N in slot 3 is valid. Word ends in H, not E – fails.\n\nWe must end in E. So: “BLEND” – no. “CLONE” – O is out. “FLUTE” – U, T out. “GNOME” – O, M out. “MIDGE” – I, D, G, E. I is out. \n\nWorking within the rules: word must be 5 letters, ends in E, no A,R,O,S,U,T,I, and must include N somewhere in 1-4.\n\nA valid candidate is “GNOME” – no, O is out. “PLUME” – U out. “CHIME” – I out.\n\nWait – how about “LYNCE”? Not a valid word. A real word fitting is “NUDGE” – but U out. \n\nRealizing: with vowels exhausted except E, and consonants limited, a valid word is “BLEND” but it lacks N and ends in D. \n\nRecalculating: list all 5-letter words ending in E with no A,R,O,S,U,T,I and containing N.\n\nA valid dictionary word is “NEWIE” – no, W and E but W not tested, yet I is out. \n\n“NEVRE” – not valid. \n\n“BEFNE” – not valid. \n\n“CENSE” – S out. \n\n“DENNE” – N in slot 2 (invalid). \n\n“FENCE” – same, N in slot 2 invalid. \n\n“HENGE” – H, N, G.

From the PENCE feedback:
- P(✓) → P is correct and in position 1.
- E(✓) → E is correct and in position 2.
- N(✓) → N is correct and in position 3.
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is correct and in position 5.

So the word is now fully locked in except for position 4. The pattern is:
P E N _ E

- PEN DE → PENDE (not valid)
- PEN SE → PEASE (S is out)
- PEN KE → PENKE (not valid)
- PEN ME → PENME (not valid)
- PEN VE → PENVE (not valid)
- PEN LE → PENLE (not valid)
- PEN NE → PENNE (valid and fits)

PENNE:
- P, E, N, N, E
- All letters are allowed (N is already confirmed)
- No forbidden letters

Therefore, PENNE is the next logical guess.
