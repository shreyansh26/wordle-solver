Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. Some popular high-information starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"".

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and a nice mix of consonants and vowels.

- Use as many other unused common letters as possible.

One such word is “RAINE” but that has a repeated E (no good).  
Another option: “CRANE” – but it uses T (not allowed) – wait, no, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E – no T.

From the latest feedback:

x ✓ ✓ ✓ x

- Position 2 = R ✓
- Position 3 = E ✓
- Position 4 = A ✓
- Letters B and D are NOT in the word.

So far we have:

_ R E A _

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, C, N, B, D.

We still need a letter for position 1 and position 5.
The word must be 5 letters and all letters used must be among the remaining alphabet (excluding the above).

Letters still available include: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels I, O, U (since A and E are already placed).

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in -REA? or starting with F,G,H,K,M,P,W + REA?

Possible endings for position 5: We need to combine with R E A.

Some candidates:
- FREAK (but K at end, F at start)
- GREAT (but T is out)
- BREAK (B is out)
- CREAK (C is out)
- WREAK (W is in play, K is in play)

So WREAK seems viable.

Check constraints:
- W, R, E, A, K
- R, E, A are in correct spots
- W and K are new letters, not ruled out yet.

Let's try WREAK.
