For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. Classic starting words often use vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use several of these. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains 5 different common letters including 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

This gives us good coverage across the alphabet and will likely give us some information about at least 2-3 letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(-)  → A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.  
R(x)  → R is NOT in the word.  
O(x)  → O is NOT in the word.  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but NOT in position 4.  
E(x)  → E is NOT in the word.  

Round 2: LASTS  
L(-)  → L is in the word, but NOT in position 1.  
A(-)  → A is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (confirmed).  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but NOT in position 3.  
T(x)  → T is NOT in the word.  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that exist in the word: A, L, S  
- Letters that do NOT exist in the word: R, O, E, T  
- Known positions to avoid:
  – A cannot be 1st or 2nd
  – L cannot be 1st
  – S cannot be 3rd, 4th, or 5th

Hence S must be in position 1 or 2.  
A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
L can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct a word that satisfies:
- S is in 1st or 2nd
- A is in 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- L is somewhere else
- Does not use R, O, E, T

A simple candidate is “SALSA”:
- S in 1st (valid for S)
- A in 2nd → but A cannot be 2nd (from LASTS feedback). Rejected.

Next try “SALAD”:
- Contains D (allowed).  
- A in 3rd.  
- S in 1st.  
- L in 2nd.  
But D hasn’t been tested yet; let’s use D (no info against it).

Wait, let’s use “SLASH”:
- S in 1st, L in 2nd, A in 3rd, S in 4th, H in 5th.  
  – S in 1st (ok).  
  – A in 3rd (ok).  
  – L in 2nd (ok).  
  – Doesn’t reuse T, R, O, E.  
  – H is new but common.

However, S will appear twice; our previous feedback never ruled out double S.  
But we prefer to avoid duplicates for maximum info.

Round 2: LASTS  
L(-)  → L is in the word, but NOT in position 1.  
A(-)  → A is in the word, but NOT in position 2 (confirmed).  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but NOT in position 3.  
T(x)  → T is NOT in the word.  
S(-)  → S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters that exist in the word: A, L, S  
- Letters that do NOT exist in the word: R, O, E, T  
- Known positions to avoid:
  – A cannot be 1st or 2nd
  – L cannot be 1st
  – S cannot be 3rd, 4th, or 5th

Hence S must be in position 1 or 2.  
A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
L can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct a word that satisfies:
- S is in 1st or 2nd
- A is in 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- L is somewhere else
- Does not use R, O, E, T

A simple candidate is “SALSA”:
- S in 1st (valid for S)
- A in 2nd → but A cannot be 2nd (from LASTS feedback). Rejected.

Next try “SALAD”:
- Contains D (allowed).  
- A in 3rd.  
- S in 1st.  
- L in 2nd.  
But D hasn’t been tested yet; let’s use D (no info against it).

Wait, let’s use “SLASH”:
- S in 1st, L in 2nd, A in 3rd, S in 4th, H in 5th.  
  – S in 1st (ok).  
  – A in 3rd (ok).  
  – L in 2nd (ok).  
  – Doesn’t reuse T, R, O, E.  
  – H is new but common.

However, S will appear twice; our previous feedback never ruled out double S.  
But we prefer to avoid duplicates for maximum info.  

Try “SLAIN”:
- S in 1st, L in 2nd, A in 3rd, I in 4th, N in 5th.  
All letters are new or known exist (A, L, S), and positions comply.

Let’s go with SLAIN.

Now we have three rounds of feedback.

Known facts:
1. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - A  (exactly in position 3, from SLAIN feedback)
   - L  (from LASTS: L(-) — so it is in the word but not in position 2)
   - S  (from AROSE: S(-) — so it is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5; from LASTS also not in 3 or 5; from SLAIN not in position 1)
     - Combining all constraints on S:
       - Cannot be 1, 3, 4, or 5 → must be position 2.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.

3. So far we have:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: S (forced)
   Position 3: A (forced)
   Positions 4 & 5: unknown, but must be from remaining letters.

4. Remaining candidate letters (not yet eliminated and not yet used):
   - Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   - (We already know A is used and in the right spot, L is used but position unknown, S is used and in the right spot.)

5. We need two more letters for positions 1, 4, 5 with these constraints:
   - L must appear somewhere (but not in position 2 because it must be S there; not in position 3 because it’s A; so L must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
   - No duplicates yet ruled out, but we prefer unique letters for more info.

6. To maximize information, let’s place L in position 1 (a common pattern: L _ A _ _).
   Then we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding any used or banned letters.

   Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

   Let’s pick two common ones: C and D.

   Candidate word: L S A C D → ""LSACD"" is not a valid English word.
   Try ""L S A C _"": ""LSACK"" – invalid.
   Try ""L S A C K"" – invalid (and K already okay).
   Actually, let's try ""L S A C K"" — ""LSACK"" is not a word.
   ""L S A L _"" duplicates L which is possible but not ideal for info.
   Try ""L S A V E"" – but E is banned.

   Let’s step back: the pattern is ? S A ? ? with L somewhere and remaining letters.
   Better strategy: form a valid word.

   Try ""B L A S T"" – but T is banned and B not tested.

   Actually, we know:
   - S must be 2nd
   - A must be 3rd
   - L must be in 1, 4, or 5
   - Avoid R, O, E, T, I, N

   Let’s list possible valid words that fit:
   - _ S A _ _ with L somewhere and other letters from unbanned set.

   Possible candidates:
   - ""PSALM"" – P, S, A, L, M: but S is not in position 2.
   - ""USUAL"" – but U,S,U,A,L: pattern doesn't fit.
   - ""SCALD"" – S in 1, not 2.
   - ""ASCAL"" – A in 1, not 3.
   - ""SCALP"" – S in 1.
   - ""CLASP"" – C, L, A, S, P: A is 3rd, S is 4th — but S must be 2nd.

   We need S in position 2 exactly. So pattern: ? S A ? ?

   Valid English words with this pattern:
   - ""BSIDE"" – but E banned, and B not tested.
   - ""CSAVY"" – not a word.
   - ""DSLAM"" – not a common word.
   - ""PSALM"" – S is 2nd, A is 3rd: yes! Letters: P, S, A, L, M.
     - P, M not yet banned or confirmed.
     - L is in 4th position – allowed (L(-) just means not in 2nd, which is S).
     - No banned letters (R,O,E,T,I,N).

   ""PSALM"" seems valid.

   Verify:
   - S is 2nd (required)
   - A is 3rd (required)
   - L is 4th (allowed)
   - P and M are new letters not yet ruled out.
   - No duplicates.

   Let’s use PSALM.

- S is exactly in position 2 (only position not yet ruled out for S).
