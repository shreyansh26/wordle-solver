Since this is my first guess and I have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that helps maximize information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters in the English language to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word would use a combination of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters.

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, A, T, E (all common letters)
- No repeated letters
- Covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters in the English language to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word would use a combination of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters.

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, A, T, E (all common letters)
- No repeated letters
- Covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

- S (x) – not in the word

- A (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3)
- T (x) – not in the word
- E (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5)

Letters we now know ARE in the word: A and E  
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: S, L, T  

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and E but does NOT contain S, L, or T, and places A and E in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Also, we want to test new common letters to maximize information. Good candidates are R, N, O, I, C, H, etc.

One strong candidate is “REACH”:
- R – common, not yet tested
- E – in the word, in position 1 instead of 5
- A – in the word, in position 2 instead of 3
- C – common, not yet tested
- H – common, not yet tested

This word meets all constraints and introduces three new common letters.

- Letters that ARE in the word: A and E
- Letter R is in the word and already in the correct first position (R ✓).

So the pattern so far is R _ _ _ _.  
We still need to place both A and E somewhere other than positions 3 or 2 respectively, and we cannot use S, L, T, C, H.

Good remaining common consonants: N, D, G, M, B, F, etc.  
Vowels left to place: A and E must still appear once each.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 5 from previous, but 5 was only forbidden for first guess; now only 2 is forbidden)

We want a word that:
- starts with R
- uses A and E somewhere in positions 2-5
- only uses letters not yet ruled out
- introduces new common consonants.

One good candidate is “RANGE”:
- R ✓ already fixed in position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N new consonant
- G new consonant
- E in position 5 (no longer forbidden from first feedback)

This uses A and E and introduces N, G which are common and untested.
