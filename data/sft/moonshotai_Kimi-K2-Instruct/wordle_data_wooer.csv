Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess in Wordle is to use a word that contains common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet. Common starting words include:

- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- SLATE: covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: another good starter
- ROAST: covers common letters

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). This provides good information about which of these important letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:

- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. Word contains the letter E, but E is not last.
2. Letters S, L, A, T are absent from the whole word.

We should pick a new word that:
- Includes E somewhere not in position 5.
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Contains other common letters (R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.) to gather more data.

A good candidate is “CRONE”:

Current knowledge:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N  
Letters we know ARE in the word:  
- O is in the 3rd position (✓ at position 3).  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from Guess 2 it was in position 5 with “-”; Guess 1 it was in position 5 with “-” as well).  
  Thus E must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already O, so E must be in position 1.  
Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So far the word pattern looks like:

E _ O _ _

with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O), so R must be in 4 or 5.

Also, positions 2 and 4/5 must be filled with letters we haven’t ruled out and that are common.  
Good letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A word that fits E _ O _ _, contains R in 4 or 5, and introduces new common letters is:

E   _   O   R   _

For the 2nd letter, a common consonant not yet ruled out is M, H, D, F, G.  
Let’s try “EMORY” – but O is already in position 3 and R is in 4.  
Wait, is “EMORY” a valid 5-letter word? No, that’s 5 letters but doesn’t fit constraints (Y is ok).  
Actually, a simpler and valid word is “EMERG” – but “emerg” is not a valid English word.  

Better choice: “EMBOW” – but B wasn’t used yet.  
Simpler: “EPOXY” – has P and X/Y, but we haven’t used P, X is less common.  

A common word that fits E _ O R _ is “ERROR” but R is in 2nd position which we know is wrong (R is not in 2nd position).  

Next: “EWORD” – but W wasn't used, and D is ok.  

Actually, the pattern E _ O _ _ plus R needs to be in 4 or 5.  
Best common word fitting E _ O R _ is “EVOKE” – let’s check:

E V O K E – but E is duplicated and we know E must be in position 1, not 5.  

Another: “EMORY” isn’t valid.  

How about “EYRIE” – but that doesn’t fit.  

Actually, the pattern is E _ O _ _, with R in 4 or 5.  
Let’s try R in 4: E _ O R _ → “EMORY” invalid.  
R in 5: E _ O _ R → “EMEER” – “emeer” is variant spelling of “emir”, but not common.  

Better to pick a valid word: “EMBOW” – but B not used.  

Another valid word fitting E _ O _ R is “ELBOW” – but L is ruled out.  

Valid word: “EPOXY” – but X and Y.  

Actually, a very common word fitting E _ O _ R is “ENJOY” – J is new, N is ruled out.  

Wait, let me list possible patterns:

E _ O R _ → needs consonant in 2nd and 5th positions.  
E _ O _ R → needs consonant in 2nd and 4th positions.  

Valid common words:  
- E F O R T – but T is ruled out.  
- E V O L R – not valid.  

Actually, “EPHOR” is a valid word but uncommon.  

The safest is to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to test positions.  
Let’s choose “EPHOR” – it’s valid (ancient Greek overseer), fits E _ O R, and tests P and H.

Next: “EWORD” – but W wasn't used, and D is ok.  

Actually, the pattern E _ O _ _ plus R needs to be in 4 or 5.  
Best common word fitting E _ O R _ is “EVOKE” – let’s check:

E V O K E – but E is duplicated and we know E must be in position 1, not 5.  

Another: “EMORY” isn’t valid.  

How about “EYRIE” – but that doesn’t fit.  

Actually, the pattern is E _ O _ _, with R in 4 or 5.  
Let’s try R in 4: E _ O R _ → “EMORY” invalid.  
R in 5: E _ O _ R → “EMEER” – “emeer” is variant spelling of “emir”, but not common.  

Better to pick a valid word: “EMBOW” – but B not used.  

Another valid word fitting E _ O _ R is “ELBOW” – but L is ruled out.  

Valid word: “EPOXY” – but X and Y.  

Actually, a very common word fitting E _ O _ R is “ENJOY” – J is new, N is ruled out.  

Wait, let me list possible patterns:

E _ O R _ → needs consonant in 2nd and 5th positions.  
E _ O _ R → needs consonant in 2nd and 4th positions.  

Valid common words:  
- E F O R T – but T is ruled out.  
- E V O L R – not valid.  

Actually, “EPHOR” is a valid word but uncommon.  

The safest is to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to test positions.  
Let’s choose “EPHOR” – it’s valid (ancient Greek overseer), fits E _ O R, and tests P and H.

So: E P H O R  

But wait, O is position 3 (✓), R must be in 4 or 5. Here R is in 5.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, P, H  
Letters **confirmed** in the word:  
- O is in it but **not** in position 3 (✓ at 3 in CRONE, but – at 3 in EPHOR)  
- R is in it and **must be in position 5** (✓ at 5 in EPHOR)  
- E is in it but **not** in positions 1 or 5 (from SLATE, CRONE, EPHOR)  

So the pattern is:  
_ _ _ _ R (position 5 is R)  
E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).  

We need a valid 5-letter word that  
- ends in R,  
- contains both E and O exactly once each,  
- uses no banned letters (S,L,A,T,C,N,P,H),  
- places E in 2/3/4 and O in 1/2/4.

Common remaining consonants: D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate pattern:  
1 2 3 4 5  
_ _ E _ R   or   _ E _ _ R   or   _ _ _ E R with O in 1/2/4.

A quick scan suggests:

- V O I D R – invalid (O first, but D allowed, but R is 5th).  
- F O V E R – invalid (V and F ok, but E is 4th, O is 2nd).  
- M O V E R – M allowed, O allowed, V allowed, E allowed, R fixed in 5th.  

“MOVER” fits:
- letters: M, O, V, E, R  
- banned letters avoided  
- O is in position 2 (allowed)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy for a first guess in Wordle is to use a word that contains common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet. Common starting words include:

- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- SLATE: covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: another good starter
- ROAST: covers common letters

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). This provides good information about which of these important letters are in the word and their positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).

So we now know:
1. Word contains the letter E, but E is not last.
2. Letters S, L, A, T are absent from the whole word.

We should pick a new word that:
- Includes E somewhere not in position 5.
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Contains other common letters (R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.) to gather more data.

A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet.
- E is included, but not in the 5th spot (it’s in the 4th spot here).

Let’s go with that.

- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from Guess 2 it was in position 5 with “-”; Guess 1 it was in position 5 with “-” as well).  
  Thus E must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already O, so E must be in position 1.  
Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So far the word pattern looks like:

E _ O _ _

with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O), so R must be in 4 or 5.

Also, positions 2 and 4/5 must be filled with letters we haven’t ruled out and that are common.  
Good letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A word that fits E _ O _ _, contains R in 4 or 5, and introduces new common letters is:

E   _   O   R   _

For the 2nd letter, a common consonant not yet ruled out is M, H, D, F, G.  
Let’s try “EMORY” – but O is already in position 3 and R is in 4.  
Wait, is “EMORY” a valid 5-letter word? No, that’s 5 letters but doesn’t fit constraints (Y is ok).  
Actually, a simpler and valid word is “EMERG” – but “emerg” is not a valid English word.  

Better choice: “EMBOW” – but B wasn’t used yet.  
Simpler: “EPOXY” – has P and X/Y, but we haven’t used P, X is less common.  

A common word that fits E _ O R _ is “ERROR” but R is in 2nd position which we know is wrong (R is not in 2nd position).  

Next: “EWORD” – but W wasn't used, and D is ok.

Best common word fitting E _ O R _ is “EVOKE” – let’s check:

E V O K E – but E is duplicated and we know E must be in position 1, not 5.  

Another: “EMORY” isn’t valid.  

How about “EYRIE” – but that doesn’t fit.  

Actually, the pattern is E _ O _ _, with R in 4 or 5.  
Let’s try R in 4: E _ O R _ → “EMORY” invalid.  
R in 5: E _ O _ R → “EMEER” – “emeer” is variant spelling of “emir”, but not common.  

Better to pick a valid word: “EMBOW” – but B not used.  

Another valid word fitting E _ O _ R is “ELBOW” – but L is ruled out.  

Valid word: “EPOXY” – but X and Y.  

Actually, a very common word fitting E _ O _ R is “ENJOY” – J is new, N is ruled out.  

Wait, let me list possible patterns:

E _ O R _ → needs consonant in 2nd and 5th positions.  
E _ O _ R → needs consonant in 2nd and 4th positions.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,wooer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess in Wordle is to use a word that contains common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet. Common starting words include:

- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- SLATE: covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: another good starter
- ROAST: covers common letters

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes three very common consonants (S, L, T) and two common vowels (A, E). This provides good information about which of these important letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. Word contains the letter E, but E is not last.
2. Letters S, L, A, T are absent from the whole word.

We should pick a new word that:
- Includes E somewhere not in position 5.
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Contains other common letters (R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.) to gather more data.

A good candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet.
- E is included, but not in the 5th spot (it’s in the 4th spot here).

Let’s go with that.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N  
Letters we know ARE in the word:  
- O is in the 3rd position (✓ at position 3).  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from Guess 2 it was in position 5 with “-”; Guess 1 it was in position 5 with “-” as well).  
  Thus E must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already O, so E must be in position 1.  
Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So far the word pattern looks like:

E _ O _ _

with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O), so R must be in 4 or 5.

Also, positions 2 and 4/5 must be filled with letters we haven’t ruled out and that are common.  
Good letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A word that fits E _ O _ _, contains R in 4 or 5, and introduces new common letters is:

E   _   O   R   _

For the 2nd letter, a common consonant not yet ruled out is M, H, D, F, G.  
Let’s try “EMORY” – but O is already in position 3 and R is in 4.  
Wait, is “EMORY” a valid 5-letter word? No, that’s 5 letters but doesn’t fit constraints (Y is ok).  
Actually, a simpler and valid word is “EMERG” – but “emerg” is not a valid English word.  

Better choice: “EMBOW” – but B wasn’t used yet.  
Simpler: “EPOXY” – has P and X/Y, but we haven’t used P, X is less common.  

A common word that fits E _ O R _ is “ERROR” but R is in 2nd position which we know is wrong (R is not in 2nd position).  

Next: “EWORD” – but W wasn't used, and D is ok.  

Actually, the pattern E _ O _ _ plus R needs to be in 4 or 5.  
Best common word fitting E _ O R _ is “EVOKE” – let’s check:

E V O K E – but E is duplicated and we know E must be in position 1, not 5.  

Another: “EMORY” isn’t valid.  

How about “EYRIE” – but that doesn’t fit.  

Actually, the pattern is E _ O _ _, with R in 4 or 5.  
Let’s try R in 4: E _ O R _ → “EMORY” invalid.  
R in 5: E _ O _ R → “EMEER” – “emeer” is variant spelling of “emir”, but not common.  

Better to pick a valid word: “EMBOW” – but B not used.  

Another valid word fitting E _ O _ R is “ELBOW” – but L is ruled out.  

Valid word: “EPOXY” – but X and Y.  

Actually, a very common word fitting E _ O _ R is “ENJOY” – J is new, N is ruled out.  

Wait, let me list possible patterns:

E _ O R _ → needs consonant in 2nd and 5th positions.  
E _ O _ R → needs consonant in 2nd and 4th positions.  

Valid common words:  
- E F O R T – but T is ruled out.  
- E V O L R – not valid.  

Actually, “EPHOR” is a valid word but uncommon.  

The safest is to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to test positions.  
Let’s choose “EPHOR” – it’s valid (ancient Greek overseer), fits E _ O R, and tests P and H.

So: E P H O R  

But wait, O is position 3 (✓), R must be in 4 or 5. Here R is in 5.  
This fits all constraints.

Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, P, H  
Letters **confirmed** in the word:  
- O is in it but **not** in position 3 (✓ at 3 in CRONE, but – at 3 in EPHOR)  
- R is in it and **must be in position 5** (✓ at 5 in EPHOR)  
- E is in it but **not** in positions 1 or 5 (from SLATE, CRONE, EPHOR)  

So the pattern is:  
_ _ _ _ R (position 5 is R)  
E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).  

We need a valid 5-letter word that  
- ends in R,  
- contains both E and O exactly once each,  
- uses no banned letters (S,L,A,T,C,N,P,H),  
- places E in 2/3/4 and O in 1/2/4.

Candidate pattern:  
1 2 3 4 5

- F O V E R – invalid (V and F ok, but E is 4th, O is 2nd).  
- M O V E R – M allowed, O allowed, V allowed, E allowed, R fixed in 5th.

From the feedback so far we know:

- Pattern: _ O _ E R  
  – Position 2 = O (✓ in MOVER, FOYER)  
  – Position 4 = E (✓ in MOVER, FOYER)  
  – Position 5 = R (✓ in EPHOR, MOVER, FOYER)  

- Letters already eliminated:  
  S, L, A, T, C, N, P, H, M, V, F, Y  

- Remaining unused common consonants: D, G, I, K, U, W, B, etc.

So we need a word of the form D/ G / I / K / U / W / B … plus O … plus any unused consonant … plus E R.

The simplest common word that fits is “DOGER” (but DOGER is not a standard English word).  
A valid common word is “GONER” (but N is already eliminated).  
Another is “WOKER” (but K and W are still available).  
Wait, “WOKER” is not common.  

Actually, a valid and common word that fits is “BOXER” – but B and X are allowed, and O is in 2, E in 4, R in 5.  However, we don’t know about X yet.  

Looking again: “GONER” has “N” which is eliminated.  

“DOWER” (D, O, W, E, R) – this uses D and W, both still allowed and common.  

“DOWER” is a valid English word meaning a widow’s share of her husband’s estate, and it fits the pattern _ O _ E R.

Let’s pick “DOWER”.
