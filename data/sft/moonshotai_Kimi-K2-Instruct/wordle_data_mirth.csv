Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, I want to choose a word that can give us the most information possible. The best strategy for the first word is to use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words use letters like A, E, R, S, T, O, I, N, L, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words. Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words for Wordle-type games due to its combination of very common vowels and consonants.

Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s think of a word that uses these. One good candidate is ""TRULY"":
- T, R, U, L, Y
- Contains R (and not in position 2)
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters (A, O, S, E)
- Uses common letters and fills in new positions for R.

Another candidate could be ""URINE"" but E is excluded, so that's out. ""BRISK"" has S and E, so no. ""CRIMP"" has no exclusion letters and uses R not in position 2. But let's go with ""TRULY"" as it covers new ground.

Wait, let me double-check ""TRULY"":
- T: new
- R: in word, not in position 2 (good)
- U: new
- L: new
- Y: new
And excludes A, O, S, E as required.

2. R is not in positions 2 or 3.

- T can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since 1 is excluded).

- DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y → Y is excluded
- FORTY: O and Y excluded
- PRINT: P, R, I, N, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- TRIKE: E excluded
- TRICK: C is allowed, but R is position 1 (valid), T position 2 (valid) → Let me check: T R I C K → T in position 1 (invalid)
- CRIMP: C, R, I, M, P → No T
- RIGHT: R, I, G, H, T → R in position 1 (valid), T in position 5 (valid) → All letters are allowed (no excluded ones). This seems to fit all constraints!

Let’s verify RIGHT:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TRULY:

- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirms earlier information)
- U(x) → U is not in the word
- L(x) → L is not in the word
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word

Summary of known facts:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, T
- Known positions to avoid for R: positions 2 and 3 (from both guesses)
- Known position to avoid for T: position 1

Remaining common letters: I, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both R and T.
2. R is not in positions 2 or 3.
3. T is not in position 1.
4. Excludes all eliminated letters (A, O, S, E, U, L, Y).

Let’s list possible placements:
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are excluded).
- T can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since 1 is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- BIRTH: B, I, R, T, H → R is in position 3 (invalid, excluded)
- DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y → Y is excluded
- FORTY: O and Y excluded
- PRINT: P, R, I, N, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- TRIKE: E excluded
- TRICK: C is allowed, but R is position 1 (valid), T position 2 (valid) → Let me check: T R I C K → T in position 1 (invalid)
- CRIMP: C, R, I, M, P → No T
- RIGHT: R, I, G, H, T → R in position 1 (valid), T in position 5 (valid) → All letters are allowed (no excluded ones). This seems to fit all constraints!

Let’s verify RIGHT:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both R and T
- Excludes all eliminated letters (A, O, S, E, U, L, Y)
- All letters (R, I, G, H, T) are allowed based on prior feedback.

This looks like the best next guess.

Let's update the constraints from all the feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: A, O, S, E
   - R exists but not in position 2

2. TRULY → T(-) R(-) U(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - Letters not in word: U, L, Y (add to list: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y)
   - T exists but not in position 1
   - R exists but not in position 2 or 3 (from new placement in TRULY)

3. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(-) T(-)
   - I is correct in position 2
   - G is not in the word (add to exclusions: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G)
   - R exists but not in position 1 (from RIGHT)
   - T exists but not in position 1 or 5
   - H exists but not in position 4

Current constraints:
- Must contain: R, T (from earlier)
- Must have I in position 2
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from RIGHT, AROSE, TRULY)
   → R must be in position 4 or 5
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TRULY, RIGHT)
   → T must be in position 2, 3, or 4
- H exists but not in position 4 → H could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

But we know I is in position 2, so H cannot be in position 2. Also, T must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 2 is taken by I).

Possible structure:
Position 1: [any allowed letter except R, T, I]
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: [T or other allowed]
Position 4: [R or T, depending]
Position 5: [remaining letters]

Let's list allowed letters now (from remaining alphabet excluding banned ones):
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels: I (used in pos 2), so only possible vowel left is I (but already used)

Thus, remaining letters must be consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Now build possible words:
- R must be in 4 or 5
- T must be in 3 or 4
- I is fixed in position 2

Case 1: R in position 4
Then T must be in position 3 or 5. But T cannot be in 5 (from RIGHT), so T must be in 3:
Structure: _ I T R _

Now fill positions 1 and 5 from remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), ensuring H hasn't been placed yet but is allowed anywhere except 4.

Possible words:
- B I T R _
- C I T R _
- ...
- H I T R _

Let's check:
- H I T R _: Need a final consonant. Possible: HITRN? Not a word.
- B I T R Y? Y is banned.
- D I T R ?
- F I T R ?
- M I T R ?

Looking for real words: ""B I T R _"" - BITRY? No. ""C I T R _"" - CITRN? No. ""F I T R _"" - FITRN? No.

Hmm, maybe no valid word with R in 4 and T in 3.

Case 2: R in position 5
Then T must be in position 3 or 4 (since 2 is I, and 1,5 are excluded for T)

Subcase 2a: T in 3
Structure: _ I T _ R
Fill positions 1 and 4 from remaining consonants (B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z)

Possible:
- B I T C R? No
- C I T _ R: C I T H R? CITHR? Not a word.
- F I T _ R: F I T C H R? Too long.
- H I T _ R: H I T C H R? No.
- N I T _ R: N I T C H R? No.

Subcase 2b: T in 4
Structure: _ I _ T R
Fill positions 1 and 3 from remaining consonants.

Possible:
- B I _ T R: B I N T R? BINTR? No. B I C T R? No.
- C I _ T R: C I N T R? CINTR? No.
- F I _ T R: F I N T R? No.

- M I _ T R: M I N T R? No.
- N I _ T R: N I N T R? No.
- P I _ T R: P I N T R? No.

Wait, let me think of actual English words. The structure _ I _ T R is rare. Maybe ""PINTO""? But O is banned. ""HINTS""? S is banned. ""BINTH""? Not a word.

Alternative approach: Maybe H is in position 1.
Then structure: H I _ _ _
With I in 2, R and T must fit in 3,4,5 with constraints:
- R must be 4 or 5 (from earlier)
- T must be 3 or 4 (from earlier)

Let’s try:
- H I T R _: But T in 3, R in 4 → H I T R _ → need 5th letter. But all letters used. HITR? Not 5 letters.
- H I _ T R: H I _ T R → positions 3: must be consonant. H I N T R? HINTR? Not a word.
- H I _ R T: R must be 4 or 5. Here R is 4, T is 5. T is allowed in 5? From RIGHT, T is not in 5 (✓ means position unknown, but feedback was T(-) meaning T is in word but not in position 5. So T cannot be in 5.

Thus, T cannot be in 5, so H I _ R T is invalid.

Another possibility: Maybe R is in 5, T in 3 or 4, and H is somewhere.

Let me list possible words that fit _ I _ _ R or _ I _ _ T etc.

Looking at valid English words:
- ""CRIB"" - too short
- ""BRISK"" - S banned
- ""FIRTH"" - H in 4 is banned (from RIGHT: H(-) means not in 4), but H in 5 is allowed
   - F I R T H → positions: F(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5)
   - Check constraints:
     - R is in 3 - but earlier we saw R cannot be in 3 (from TRULY feedback: R(-) in position 2 in TRULY and position 1 in RIGHT, so R cannot be in 1,2,3 - must be 4 or 5. So R in 3 is invalid (from TRULY feedback R(-) in position 2 and RIGHT feedback R(-) in position 1 - actually no, RIGHT has R in position 1 as (-), so R cannot be in 1, and TRULY has R in 2 as (-), so R cannot be in 2. Thus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier conclusion was wrong - R cannot be in 1 or 2, but can be in 3,4,5.

Wait, let me re-examine R placements:
- AROSE: R in 2 (-) → R not in 2
- TRULY: R in 2 (-) → same info
- RIGHT: R in 1 (-) → R not in 1

Thus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier mistake was excluding 3.

Now with I in 2, let's re-examine:

Structure: _ I _ _ _
R must be in 3,4, or 5
T must be in 3,4 (since 1 and 5 banned for T)

But I is in 2, so T could be 3 or 4

Option 1: R in 3, T in 4
Structure: _ I R T _
Possible: B I R T H? B I R T H - check letters: B, I, R, T, H
- All letters allowed (no banned ones)
- R in 3: allowed
- T in 4: allowed
- H in 5: allowed
- I in 2: correct

""BIRTH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let's verify:

The best strategy for the first word is to use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words use letters like A, E, R, S, T, O, I, N, L, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words. Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words for Wordle-type games due to its combination of very common vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, E
- R is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (but not in position 2)
- Does not contain A, O, S, E
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s think of a word that uses these. One good candidate is ""TRULY"":
- T, R, U, L, Y
- Contains R (and not in position 2)
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters (A, O, S, E)
- Uses common letters and fills in new positions for R.

Another candidate could be ""URINE"" but E is excluded, so that's out. ""BRISK"" has S and E, so no. ""CRIMP"" has no exclusion letters and uses R not in position 2. But let's go with ""TRULY"" as it covers new ground.

Wait, let me double-check ""TRULY"":
- T: new
- R: in word, not in position 2 (good)
- U: new
- L: new
- Y: new
And excludes A, O, S, E as required.

Yes, this seems optimal.

<guess>TRULY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRULY -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) U(x) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TRULY:

- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirms earlier information)
- U(x) → U is not in the word
- L(x) → L is not in the word
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word

Summary of known facts:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, T
- Known positions to avoid for R: positions 2 and 3 (from both guesses)
- Known position to avoid for T: position 1

Remaining common letters: I, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both R and T.
2. R is not in positions 2 or 3.
3. T is not in position 1.
4. Excludes all eliminated letters (A, O, S, E, U, L, Y).

Let’s list possible placements:
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are excluded).
- T can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since 1 is excluded).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- BIRTH: B, I, R, T, H → R is in position 3 (invalid, excluded)
- DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y → Y is excluded
- FORTY: O and Y excluded
- PRINT: P, R, I, N, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T → R in position 2 (invalid)
- TRIKE: E excluded
- TRICK: C is allowed, but R is position 1 (valid), T position 2 (valid) → Let me check: T R I C K → T in position 1 (invalid)
- CRIMP: C, R, I, M, P → No T
- RIGHT: R, I, G, H, T → R in position 1 (valid), T in position 5 (valid) → All letters are allowed (no excluded ones). This seems to fit all constraints!

Let’s verify RIGHT:
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both R and T
- Excludes all eliminated letters (A, O, S, E, U, L, Y)
- All letters (R, I, G, H, T) are allowed based on prior feedback.

This looks like the best next guess.

<guess>RIGHT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRULY -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) U(x) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: RIGHT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's update the constraints from all the feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: A, O, S, E
   - R exists but not in position 2

2. TRULY → T(-) R(-) U(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - Letters not in word: U, L, Y (add to list: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y)
   - T exists but not in position 1
   - R exists but not in position 2 or 3 (from new placement in TRULY)

3. RIGHT → R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(-) T(-)
   - I is correct in position 2
   - G is not in the word (add to exclusions: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G)
   - R exists but not in position 1 (from RIGHT)
   - T exists but not in position 1 or 5
   - H exists but not in position 4

Current constraints:
- Must contain: R, T (from earlier)
- Must have I in position 2
- Cannot contain: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from RIGHT, AROSE, TRULY)
   → R must be in position 4 or 5
- T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TRULY, RIGHT)
   → T must be in position 2, 3, or 4
- H exists but not in position 4 → H could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

But we know I is in position 2, so H cannot be in position 2. Also, T must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 2 is taken by I).

Possible structure:
Position 1: [any allowed letter except R, T, I]
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: [T or other allowed]
Position 4: [R or T, depending]
Position 5: [remaining letters]

Let's list allowed letters now (from remaining alphabet excluding banned ones):
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels: I (used in pos 2), so only possible vowel left is I (but already used)

Thus, remaining letters must be consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Now build possible words:
- R must be in 4 or 5
- T must be in 3 or 4
- I is fixed in position 2

Case 1: R in position 4
Then T must be in position 3 or 5. But T cannot be in 5 (from RIGHT), so T must be in 3:
Structure: _ I T R _

Now fill positions 1 and 5 from remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), ensuring H hasn't been placed yet but is allowed anywhere except 4.

Possible words:
- B I T R _
- C I T R _
- ...
- H I T R _

Let's check:
- H I T R _: Need a final consonant. Possible: HITRN? Not a word.
- B I T R Y? Y is banned.
- D I T R ?
- F I T R ?
- M I T R ?

Looking for real words: ""B I T R _"" - BITRY? No. ""C I T R _"" - CITRN? No. ""F I T R _"" - FITRN? No.

Hmm, maybe no valid word with R in 4 and T in 3.

Case 2: R in position 5
Then T must be in position 3 or 4 (since 2 is I, and 1,5 are excluded for T)

Subcase 2a: T in 3
Structure: _ I T _ R
Fill positions 1 and 4 from remaining consonants (B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z)

Possible:
- B I T C R? No
- C I T _ R: C I T H R? CITHR? Not a word.
- F I T _ R: F I T C H R? Too long.
- H I T _ R: H I T C H R? No.
- N I T _ R: N I T C H R? No.

Subcase 2b: T in 4
Structure: _ I _ T R
Fill positions 1 and 3 from remaining consonants.

Possible:
- B I _ T R: B I N T R? BINTR? No. B I C T R? No.
- C I _ T R: C I N T R? CINTR? No.
- F I _ T R: F I N T R? No.
- H I _ T R: H I N T R? HINTR? No.
- M I _ T R: M I N T R? No.
- N I _ T R: N I N T R? No.
- P I _ T R: P I N T R? No.

Wait, let me think of actual English words. The structure _ I _ T R is rare. Maybe ""PINTO""? But O is banned. ""HINTS""? S is banned. ""BINTH""? Not a word.

Alternative approach: Maybe H is in position 1.
Then structure: H I _ _ _
With I in 2, R and T must fit in 3,4,5 with constraints:
- R must be 4 or 5 (from earlier)
- T must be 3 or 4 (from earlier)

Let’s try:
- H I T R _: But T in 3, R in 4 → H I T R _ → need 5th letter. But all letters used. HITR? Not 5 letters.
- H I _ T R: H I _ T R → positions 3: must be consonant. H I N T R? HINTR? Not a word.
- H I _ R T: R must be 4 or 5. Here R is 4, T is 5. T is allowed in 5? From RIGHT, T is not in 5 (✓ means position unknown, but feedback was T(-) meaning T is in word but not in position 5. So T cannot be in 5.

Thus, T cannot be in 5, so H I _ R T is invalid.

Another possibility: Maybe R is in 5, T in 3 or 4, and H is somewhere.

Let me list possible words that fit _ I _ _ R or _ I _ _ T etc.

Looking at valid English words:
- ""CRIB"" - too short
- ""BRISK"" - S banned
- ""FIRTH"" - H in 4 is banned (from RIGHT: H(-) means not in 4), but H in 5 is allowed
   - F I R T H → positions: F(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5)
   - Check constraints:
     - R is in 3 - but earlier we saw R cannot be in 3 (from TRULY feedback: R(-) in position 2 in TRULY and position 1 in RIGHT, so R cannot be in 1,2,3 - must be 4 or 5. So R in 3 is invalid (from TRULY feedback R(-) in position 2 and RIGHT feedback R(-) in position 1 - actually no, RIGHT has R in position 1 as (-), so R cannot be in 1, and TRULY has R in 2 as (-), so R cannot be in 2. Thus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier conclusion was wrong - R cannot be in 1 or 2, but can be in 3,4,5.

Wait, let me re-examine R placements:
- AROSE: R in 2 (-) → R not in 2
- TRULY: R in 2 (-) → same info
- RIGHT: R in 1 (-) → R not in 1

Thus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier mistake was excluding 3.

Now with I in 2, let's re-examine:

Structure: _ I _ _ _
R must be in 3,4, or 5
T must be in 3,4 (since 1 and 5 banned for T)

But I is in 2, so T could be 3 or 4

Option 1: R in 3, T in 4
Structure: _ I R T _
Possible: B I R T H? B I R T H - check letters: B, I, R, T, H
- All letters allowed (no banned ones)
- R in 3: allowed
- T in 4: allowed
- H in 5: allowed
- I in 2: correct

""BIRTH"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let's verify:
- B: new, allowed
- I: correct in 2
- R: in 3 (allowed)
- T: in 4 (allowed)
- H: in 5 (allowed)

This seems perfect.Based on the updated constraints:
- I is fixed in position 2
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- T must be in position 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded for T)
- Banned letters: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G

The word ""BIRTH"" fits all these rules:
- I is in position 2 (correct ✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- T is in position 4 (allowed)
- Contains no banned letters

So T cannot be in 5.\n\nThus, T cannot be in 5, so H I _ R T is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe R is in 5, T in 3 or 4, and H is somewhere.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit _ I _ _ R or _ I _ _ T etc.\n\nLooking at valid English words:\n- ""CRIB"" - too short\n- ""BRISK"" - S banned\n- ""FIRTH"" - H in 4 is banned (from RIGHT: H(-) means not in 4), but H in 5 is allowed\n   - F I R T H → positions: F(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5)\n   - Check constraints:\n     - R is in 3 - but earlier we saw R cannot be in 3 (from TRULY feedback: R(-) in position 2 in TRULY and position 1 in RIGHT, so R cannot be in 1,2,3 - must be 4 or 5. So R in 3 is invalid (from TRULY feedback R(-) in position 2 and RIGHT feedback R(-) in position 1 - actually no, RIGHT has R in position 1 as (-), so R cannot be in 1, and TRULY has R in 2 as (-), so R cannot be in 2. Thus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier conclusion was wrong - R cannot be in 1 or 2, but can be in 3,4,5.\n\nWait, let me re-examine R placements:\n- AROSE: R in 2 (-) → R not in 2\n- TRULY: R in 2 (-) → same info\n- RIGHT: R in 1 (-) → R not in 1\n\nThus R can be in 3,4,5. My earlier mistake was excluding 3.\n\nNow with I in 2, let\'s re-examine:\n\nStructure: _ I _ _ _\nR must be in 3,4, or 5\nT must be in 3,4 (since 1 and 5 banned for T)\n\nBut I is in 2, so T could be 3 or 4\n\nOption 1: R in 3, T in 4\nStructure: _ I R T _\nPossible: B I R T H? B I R T H - check letters: B, I, R, T, H\n- All letters allowed (no banned ones)\n- R in 3: allowed\n- T in 4: allowed\n- H in 5: allowed\n- I in 2: correct\n\n""BIRTH"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nLet\'s verify:\n- B: new, allowed\n- I: correct in 2\n- R: in 3 (allowed)\n- T: in 4 (allowed)\n- H: in 5 (allowed)\n\nThis seems perfect.Based on the updated constraints:\n- I is fixed in position 2\n- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5\n- T must be in position 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded for T)\n- Banned letters: A, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G\n\nThe word ""BIRTH"" fits all these rules:\n- I is in position 2 (correct ✓)\n- R is in position 3 (allowed)\n- T is in position 4 (allowed)\n- Contains no banned letters\n\n<guess>BIRTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRULY -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) U(x) L(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: RIGHT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(-) T(-)\nGuess 4: BIRTH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) R(✓) T(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on BIRTH:

B(x) → B is NOT in the word.  
I(✓) → I is in the word AND in position 2.  
R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 3.  
T(✓) → T is in the word AND in position 4.  
H(✓) → H is in the word AND in position 5.  

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ I R T H

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: A, B, O, S, E, U, L, Y, G

Letters already confirmed in their correct places: I, R, T, H

Possible first letters (must be a single consonant that has not been eliminated):
Allowed: C, D, F, K, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Real 5-letter words ending in ""IRTH"":
- birth (B is eliminated)
- mirth
- firth
- girth (G is eliminated)
- ...

From the allowed letters, ""MIRTH"" and ""FIRTH"" are the most likely. Both M and F have not been used yet. Between them, ""MIRTH"" is more common.

Therefore: MIRTH.
