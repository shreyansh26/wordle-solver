This is the first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. The optimal first guess in Wordle should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are good choices because they contain high-frequency letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains E, but not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does not use A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses common remaining letters like T, N, L, I, D, etc.

Good candidate letters now: T, N, L, I, D, C, M, P, U, etc.

A good second guess might be ""UNTIE"" or ""ELITE"", but ""ELITE"" repeats E and uses L/I/T which may be useful. However, since E cannot be last, ""ELITE"" is invalid (E is last). 

""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E. It uses E in position 4 (not last), and avoids A,R,O,S. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""DENIM"" - but it lacks E in it (we know E must be present). 

""UNTIE"" seems best.

Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned so far.

Letters we know are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, L, F  

Letters we know **must** appear:  
- E (but never in positions 3, 4, 5)  
- T (but never in positions 3, 5)  
- D (but never in position 1)

So the only remaining positions for each letter are:  
E: allowed only in position 1 or 2  
T: allowed only in positions 1, 2, 4  
D: allowed only in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that contains **at least** D, E, T and uses none of the banned letters.

Let’s look for valid placements:

Possible patterns (E and T must appear, E must be in 1 or 2, T in 1/2/4, D anywhere except 1):  
1) E _ _ _ _  
   – Then T must go in 2 or 4  
   – D must go in 2,3,4,5  
   – Example: E T D _ _ (check if it’s a word) → ET_D_ → ETD__ → no valid word  
   – Example: E D T _ _ → EDT__ → no  
2) T E _ _ _  
   – D must go in 3,4,5 → TED__ → TEDGY? Not valid  
3) D E T _ _ → DET__ → DETOX? O is banned.  
4) _ E T _ _ → E must be 2, T 3 → but T cannot be 3 (from feedback T cannot be 3)  
5) _ E _ T _ → E at 2, T at 4 → _ E _ T _ → need D somewhere among 1,3,5  
   – Possible word: W E D T S? S banned  
   – G E D T O? O banned  
   – B E D T H? Valid word: BEDTH? No, not a word  
   – Actually, a real word: BETID? Not valid  
   – Another real word: **B E D T S**? Not valid  
6) Consider: **D E T E X**? E repeats and X is allowed but not sure  

Let’s list real 5-letter English words that contain D, E, T and avoid the banned letters.  
We can try:  
- **TWEED**? Has W and E repeats; banned letters avoided but E is in both 2 and 5, but 5 is banned for E.  
- **T E N D E**? N banned  
- **T E D D Y**? Y allowed but double D, and E at 2 is allowed, T at 1 is allowed, D at 3 is allowed. But Y is allowed. TEDDY is a valid word. Let’s check:  
   – Letters: T, E, D, D, Y  
   – Contains E (position 2, allowed)  
   – Contains T (position 1, allowed)  
   – Contains D (position 3, allowed)  
   – Avoids all banned letters: A,R,O,S,U,N,I,L,F  
   – Y is allowed.  
   – TEDDY is a valid English word.

So **TEDDY** satisfies all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,tweed,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. The optimal first guess in Wordle should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are good choices because they contain high-frequency letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains E, but not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does not use A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses common remaining letters like T, N, L, I, D, etc.

Good candidate letters now: T, N, L, I, D, C, M, P, U, etc.

A good second guess might be ""UNTIE"" or ""ELITE"", but ""ELITE"" repeats E and uses L/I/T which may be useful. However, since E cannot be last, ""ELITE"" is invalid (E is last). 

""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E. It uses E in position 4 (not last), and avoids A,R,O,S. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""DENIM"" - but it lacks E in it (we know E must be present). 

""UNTIE"" seems best.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)

Combined feedback:

Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- At least one E, but it’s NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from both E’s being marked “-” in those spots).
- At least one T, but it’s NOT in position 3 (from T(-) in UNTIE).

Remaining consonants we can still test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels we can still test: E (already confirmed), so only E is allowed among vowels.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Must contain E, and E can’t be in positions 4 or 5.
- Must contain T, and T can’t be in position 3.
- Must avoid any of A, R, O, S, U, N, I.

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).

To maximize new information, we should pick a word that:
- Places E and T in new positions.
- Introduces new high-frequency consonants.

A word like “DELFT” contains D, E, L, F, T. 
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 5 (allowed).
- It avoids all forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “BETEL” but it repeats E twice and uses L twice, giving less info. “DELFT” is better.

Now we know:

1. T is in position 1 (✓ from TEDDY feedback).
2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from all E(-) feedback) → impossible, since position 1 is the only spot left for E. Therefore E must be in position 1.  
   So the word starts with **TE**.

3. D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from all D(-) feedback) → impossible, since every position has been ruled out. This means we made an error or overlooked something. Let me re-examine:
   - From TEDDY: T(✓) E(-) D(-) D(-) Y(x)  
     - First D: position 3, marked (-) → D is in word but not in position 3.  
     - Second D: position 4, marked (-) → D is in word but not in position 4.  
     - No prior feedback on D positions 1,2,5.  
   - From DELFT: D(-) → D is in word but not position 1.  
   - From TEDDY: D at 3 and 4 marked (-), so D is not in 3 or 4.  
   - Thus, D can only be in position 2 or 5.

4. Y is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with **T**.
- Word contains **E** (must be in position 2, since all other positions are ruled out).  
  So word starts with **TE**.

- Word contains **D** (must be in position 5, since positions 1,2,3,4 are ruled out).

So word structure: T E _ _ D.

We also know banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, L, F, Y.

We need valid 5-letter words of form TE _ _ D, avoiding banned letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4: remaining allowed letters are B, C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (excluding vowels except E which is already used).

Let’s find words:
- T E B E D → TEBED? Not a recognized word.
- T E C H D → TECHD? Not valid.
- T E X T D → Not valid.
- T E M P D → Not valid.
- T E W E D → TEWED? Not valid.
- T E G G D → Not valid.
- T E X E D → TEXED? Valid word (past tense of ""text"").

**TEXED** fits:
- Starts with T, E at 2, X at 3, E at 4, D at 5.  
- Contains T, E, D.  
- Avoids all banned letters.  
- Only E repeats, which is allowed.  

Let’s verify:  
- Position 3: X (new letter).  
- Position 4: E (allowed, since E can appear in multiple spots as long as it’s not in the ruled-out positions).  

Thus, **TEXED** is the logical next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,tweed,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. The optimal first guess in Wordle should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Common starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are good choices because they contain high-frequency letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters in English words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains E, but not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does not use A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses common remaining letters like T, N, L, I, D, etc.

Good candidate letters now: T, N, L, I, D, C, M, P, U, etc.

A good second guess might be ""UNTIE"" or ""ELITE"", but ""ELITE"" repeats E and uses L/I/T which may be useful. However, since E cannot be last, ""ELITE"" is invalid (E is last). 

""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E. It uses E in position 4 (not last), and avoids A,R,O,S. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""DENIM"" - but it lacks E in it (we know E must be present). 

""UNTIE"" seems best.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)

Combined feedback:

Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- At least one E, but it’s NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from both E’s being marked “-” in those spots).
- At least one T, but it’s NOT in position 3 (from T(-) in UNTIE).

Remaining consonants we can still test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels we can still test: E (already confirmed), so only E is allowed among vowels.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Must contain E, and E can’t be in positions 4 or 5.
- Must contain T, and T can’t be in position 3.
- Must avoid any of A, R, O, S, U, N, I.

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3.
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).

To maximize new information, we should pick a word that:
- Places E and T in new positions.
- Introduces new high-frequency consonants.

A word like “DELFT” contains D, E, L, F, T. 
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 5 (allowed).
- It avoids all forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “BETEL” but it repeats E twice and uses L twice, giving less info. “DELFT” is better.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned so far.

Letters we know are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, L, F  

Letters we know **must** appear:  
- E (but never in positions 3, 4, 5)  
- T (but never in positions 3, 5)  
- D (but never in position 1)

So the only remaining positions for each letter are:  
E: allowed only in position 1 or 2  
T: allowed only in positions 1, 2, 4  
D: allowed only in positions 2, 3, 4, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that contains **at least** D, E, T and uses none of the banned letters.

Let’s look for valid placements:

Possible patterns (E and T must appear, E must be in 1 or 2, T in 1/2/4, D anywhere except 1):  
1) E _ _ _ _  
   – Then T must go in 2 or 4  
   – D must go in 2,3,4,5  
   – Example: E T D _ _ (check if it’s a word) → ET_D_ → ETD__ → no valid word  
   – Example: E D T _ _ → EDT__ → no  
2) T E _ _ _  
   – D must go in 3,4,5 → TED__ → TEDGY? Not valid  
3) D E T _ _ → DET__ → DETOX? O is banned.  
4) _ E T _ _ → E must be 2, T 3 → but T cannot be 3 (from feedback T cannot be 3)  
5) _ E _ T _ → E at 2, T at 4 → _ E _ T _ → need D somewhere among 1,3,5  
   – Possible word: W E D T S? S banned  
   – G E D T O? O banned  
   – B E D T H? Valid word: BEDTH? No, not a word  
   – Actually, a real word: BETID? Not valid  
   – Another real word: **B E D T S**? Not valid  
6) Consider: **D E T E X**? E repeats and X is allowed but not sure  

Let’s list real 5-letter English words that contain D, E, T and avoid the banned letters.  
We can try:  
- **TWEED**? Has W and E repeats; banned letters avoided but E is in both 2 and 5, but 5 is banned for E.  
- **T E N D E**? N banned  
- **T E D D Y**? Y allowed but double D, and E at 2 is allowed, T at 1 is allowed, D at 3 is allowed. But Y is allowed. TEDDY is a valid word. Let’s check:  
   – Letters: T, E, D, D, Y  
   – Contains E (position 2, allowed)  
   – Contains T (position 1, allowed)  
   – Contains D (position 3, allowed)  
   – Avoids all banned letters: A,R,O,S,U,N,I,L,F  
   – Y is allowed.  
   – TEDDY is a valid English word.

So **TEDDY** satisfies all constraints.

2. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from all E(-) feedback) → impossible, since position 1 is the only spot left for E. Therefore E must be in position 1.  
   So the word starts with **TE**.

3. D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from all D(-) feedback) → impossible, since every position has been ruled out. This means we made an error or overlooked something. Let me re-examine:
   - From TEDDY: T(✓) E(-) D(-) D(-) Y(x)  
     - First D: position 3, marked (-) → D is in word but not in position 3.  
     - Second D: position 4, marked (-) → D is in word but not in position 4.  
     - No prior feedback on D positions 1,2,5.  
   - From DELFT: D(-) → D is in word but not position 1.  
   - From TEDDY: D at 3 and 4 marked (-), so D is not in 3 or 4.  
   - Thus, D can only be in position 2 or 5.

4. Y is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with **T**.
- Word contains **E** (must be in position 2, since all other positions are ruled out).  
  So word starts with **TE**.

- Word contains **D** (must be in position 5, since positions 1,2,3,4 are ruled out).

So word structure: T E _ _ D.

We also know banned letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, L, F, Y.

We need valid 5-letter words of form TE _ _ D, avoiding banned letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4: remaining allowed letters are B, C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (excluding vowels except E which is already used).

Let’s find words:
- T E B E D → TEBED? Not a recognized word.
- T E C H D → TECHD? Not valid.
- T E X T D → Not valid.
- T E M P D → Not valid.
- T E W E D → TEWED? Not valid.
- T E G G D → Not valid.
- T E X E D → TEXED? Valid word (past tense of ""text"").

**TEXED** fits:
- Starts with T, E at 2, X at 3, E at 4, D at 5.  
- Contains T, E, D.  
- Avoids all banned letters.  
- Only E repeats, which is allowed.  

Let’s verify:  
- Position 3: X (new letter).  
- Position 4: E (allowed, since E can appear in multiple spots as long as it’s not in the ruled-out positions).

D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from all D(-) feedback) → impossible, since every position has been ruled out. This means we made an error or overlooked something.

Let’s extract every constraint from the feedback up to Guess 5.

Known positions:
- Position 1: T (✓ from TEDDY and TEXED)
- Position 4: E (✓ from TEXED)
- Position 5: D (✓ from TEXED)

Known letters that are **not** in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, L, F, Y, X

Letters we still must place:  
We have T _ _ E D.  
The only remaining letters not yet ruled out are:  
B, C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Z (plus any unused vowels).  
But we already have two vowels (E in positions 4 and an unknown vowel must still appear), so positions 2 & 3 need to be filled with letters from the allowed consonants.

Looking for common 5-letter English words of the pattern T _ _ E D using only allowed letters:

- T B E E D → TBEED? Not a word.  
- T C E E D → Not a word.  
- T H E M D → Not a word.  
- T W E E D → TWEED (contains W, which is allowed and hasn’t been ruled out).  

Let’s check TWEED:
- Letters: T, W, E, E, D.  
- No banned letters (W is still allowed).  
- Matches T(1) _ _ E(4) D(5) pattern perfectly.  

Thus, **TWEED** is the only valid remaining candidate that meets all constraints.
