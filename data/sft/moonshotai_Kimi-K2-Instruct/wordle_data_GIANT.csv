Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This gives us the maximum chance of hitting some correct letters in the secret word. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word would use a mix of these without repeating letters to maximize information gain. 

Popular strategic starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains four vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant S, giving us good coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is present but not in position 1 → A must be in positions 2-5.
- R, O, S, E are all absent from the secret word entirely.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

That leaves us with 21 letters to work with (excluding R, O, S, E). We want a new guess that includes A in a different spot and uses other high-frequency remaining letters.

Remaining high-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, V, W, Y, K, J, Q, X, Z.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known and O, E are out).

A good strategy is to test another vowel (I or U) and some common consonants. Let’s choose “UNITY” because:
- U and I are remaining vowels.
- N and T are high-frequency consonants.
- Y is sometimes a vowel and common.

This also places A in a different position if we later need to test it.
But we can’t use Y yet because we need to know whether U, N, I, T are in the word first.

Actually, let’s pick a word with A in position 2 to test if A is there (since it wasn’t in position 1). A good candidate is “PAINT”:
- P, A, I, N, T: all are allowed letters (none of R, O, S, E).
- P, N, T are common consonants.
- I is a new vowel to test.
- A is in position 2.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE  
   A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   ⇒ R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

   ⇒ P is NOT in the word.  
   ⇒ A is in the word but not in position 2.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ N is in position 4.  
   ⇒ T is in position 5.

So the secret word looks like:
- _ _ _ N T
- Contains A (not in pos 1 or 2) and I (not in pos 3).
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, P.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4 (but 4 is N), so A must be in position 3.  
Thus the pattern is: _ _ A N T

The remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 2 must be from the set of unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the remaining vowels U (I is already placed elsewhere).

Likely high-frequency consonants for the first two slots: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M.

We also know I must appear somewhere in the word. Since it's not in position 3 and positions 4 and 5 are N and T, I must be in position 1 or 2. But I cannot be in position 3 (already known), and we have _ _ A N T, so I must be in position 1 or 2.

But we already have _ _ A N T, and I is in the word but not in position 3. So I must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s test a word that places I in position 1: I _ A N T. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""GIANT"". Let’s check:
- G, I, A, N, T: all allowed (none of R, O, S, E, P).  
- N is in position 4, T in 5 (matches).  
- A is in position 3 (matches).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it just can't be in position 3).

This seems like a strong candidate.
