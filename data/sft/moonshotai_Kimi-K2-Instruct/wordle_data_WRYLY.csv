For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good initial word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common five-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify which vowels are in the word
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid English word

This should give me good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is already in the correct 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Definitely has R in position 2.
- Does not contain A, O, S, or E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid A, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word with R in the 2nd position and none of A, O, S, E. Good remaining consonants and vowels to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “TRIUM” (if we can use uncommon words), but to stay common and valid, “CRISP” has C R I P, but contains S which we know is absent. “DRINK” has D R I N K – all allowed letters: no A, O, S, E, and R in 2nd position.

- Keep R in the 2nd slot.
- Use only letters that have not yet been ruled out.
- Incorporate fresh letters that are frequent enough to give strong information.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. DRINK → D(x) R(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)
3. CRUMB → C(x) R(✓) U(x) M(x) B(x)

All letters that have appeared so far (A, O, S, E, D, I, N, K, C, U, M, B) are ruled out, **except** for R in position 2.

Remaining common letters not yet tested, that still fit English 5-letter words:
Consonants: F, G, H, L, P, T, W, Y  
Vowels: none left (only Y sometimes acts as a vowel)

So the second letter must be R, the other four letters must be chosen only from {F, G, H, L, P, T, W, Y}. Additionally, we want the word to use only those letters.

Some candidates:
- F R Y T _  → no good 5-letter word
- F R Y T H  → “FRYTH” (obscure, probably invalid)
- H R Y P T  → impossible
- P R Y T H  → “PRYTH” (invalid)

The only common, valid 5-letter word I can form that uses R in position 2 and only the remaining letters is “FRYTH” (which is very obscure) or “TRYST” (invalid, uses S, already ruled out).  

Let me double-check:  
- G, H, L, P, T, W, Y and no other vowels.  
- The common dictionary word that fits is “FRYTH” (a spelling variant of “frith” meaning a wood), but it is still obscure.  

The next best option is “TRYST,” but it contains S which is already excluded.

Therefore, the only plausible remaining common word that fits the constraints is “FRYTH.”

However, to be safe and stick to more common words, I’ll try “FRYTH” as the best possible remaining word under the given constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good initial word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common five-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify which vowels are in the word
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid English word

This should give me good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is already in the correct 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Definitely has R in position 2.
- Does not contain A, O, S, or E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid A, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word with R in the 2nd position and none of A, O, S, E. Good remaining consonants and vowels to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “TRIUM” (if we can use uncommon words), but to stay common and valid, “CRISP” has C R I P, but contains S which we know is absent. “DRINK” has D R I N K – all allowed letters: no A, O, S, E, and R in 2nd position.

Let me choose DRINK.

2. Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, D, I, N, K.

We still need to test the remaining common consonants (B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y) and the remaining vowels (U, sometimes Y).

A good third guess should:
- Keep R in the 2nd slot.
- Use only letters that have not yet been ruled out.
- Incorporate fresh letters that are frequent enough to give strong information.

Candidate words:
- BRUIT – but I is already ruled out.
- CRUMB – C, R, U, M, B: all letters are still allowed and R is in position 2.
- GRUMP – G, R, U, M, P: likewise.
- TRULY – T, R, U, L, Y: likewise.

“CRUMB” seems solid: common letters, no repeats, and R in position 2.
