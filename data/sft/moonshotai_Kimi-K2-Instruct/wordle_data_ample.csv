Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that helps eliminate as many possibilities as possible. A good first guess typically contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
1. C - common consonant
2. R - very common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common vowel

This gives a good mix of high-frequency letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x), R(x), N(x) → eliminate C, R, N from all positions.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

- Contains A but not in 3rd spot (A could be 1,2, or 4)

A strong guess would test new common letters while fitting the pattern. ""PLATE"" uses P, L, T plus A and E. But A is in 3rd position here which we know is wrong.

From the three rounds we now know the pattern:

1. E is fixed in position 5: _ _ _ _ E  
2. L is fixed in position 4: _ _ _ L E  
3. P is fixed in position 3: _ _ P L E  
4. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (CRANE: A- and MAPLE: A-)  
   Therefore A must be in position 1 (because position 5 is E), giving the pattern: A _ P L E  

5. Eliminated consonants: C, R, N, S, T, M

Valid 5-letter words that fit A _ P L E:
- APPLE → uses A P P L E, but P already confirmed in position 3 only
- AMPLE → contains M (already eliminated)
- The only common word that fits A _ P L E is APPLE, but it has P in position 2 which is already ruled out by position 3 P.

Wait - let's re-examine:
We know P is in position 3 (✓) from MAPLE feedback, so the word must be of the form: _ _ P L E

From CRANE and STALE, A must be present but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 5 is E). This leaves only position 4 for A, but position 4 is confirmed L. This seems to create a contradiction unless...

Ah! There's a misinterpretation. The feedback for MAPLE shows:
- M(-) - M is in the word but wrong position (not position 1)
- A(-) - A is in the word but wrong position (not position 2)

So the pattern is:
- P in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5
- A is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3,5 - impossible since positions 3,4,5 are taken. This suggests A must be in position 4, but position 4 is L.

This indicates the only possible word is _ A P L E, with A in position 2. Re-evaluating MAPLE feedback:
- M(-) - M is in word but not position 1 (so M could be elsewhere)
- A(-) - A is in word but not position 2
- P(✓) - P in position 3
- L(✓) - L in position 4
- E(✓) - E in position 5

Thus the pattern is: _ _ P L E with A somewhere, but A cannot be in position 2. The only possible position for A is position 1, making the word A P P L E, but this would have two Ps, one confirmed in position 3, which would be invalid.

Looking back, the only valid word that fits all constraints is APPLE (A P P L E), even though it has P in position 2 (which would normally be excluded), but since P is confirmed in position 3 and we have no rule against duplicate letters, APPLE is the only logical choice.

However, since P is confirmed in position 3, the word must be _ _ P L E with A in position 1: A P P L E.

But this has P in both 2 and 3, which is possible. The word must be APPLE.

Wait - but MAPLE feedback shows P(✓) only in position 3, so P appears in position 3, and the word could have another P. The only possible word fitting all constraints is APPLE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good first guess typically contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
1. C - common consonant
2. R - very common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common vowel

This gives a good mix of high-frequency letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x), R(x), N(x) → eliminate C, R, N from all positions.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E ( _ _ _ _ E )
- Contains A but not in 3rd spot (A could be 1,2, or 4)
- Does NOT contain C, R, N

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Has at least one A in positions 1, 2 or 4
3. Uses only letters excluding C, R, N

Good candidate letters remaining (high-frequency, not yet eliminated): S, T, L, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.

A strong guess would test new common letters while fitting the pattern. ""PLATE"" uses P, L, T plus A and E. But A is in 3rd position here which we know is wrong. 

Another option: ""SLATE"" - but L is in 4th which would make A in 3rd (invalid). 

""STALE"" fits:
- Ends with E
- A is in 2nd position (valid)
- Uses new consonants S, T, L
- Avoids C, R, N

2. **L** is in position 4 (STALE: L✓), i.e. _ _ _ L E  
3. **A** is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (CRANE: A-, STALE: A-).  
   Therefore A must be in position 2.  So the pattern is now: _ A _ L E  

4. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, N, S, T.

Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 1st-letter consonant that:
- has not been used yet,
- can precede A _ L E to form a valid English word.

The only common 5-letter English words that fit the pattern _ A _ L E are:
- BAGLE → invalid (B in 1st, but contains G and we don’t know G yet)  
- HAGLE → same issue  
- MAPLE → M A P L E → uses M (new consonant), P (new consonant)  
- GABLE → G A B L E → uses G (new consonant), B (new consonant)  
- DABLE → not a valid word  
- FABLE → F A B L E → uses F, B  

Among these, **MAPLE** and **FABLE** both use entirely new letters (M/P or F/B) and fit perfectly.  
Between them, MAPLE is slightly more common in word-frequency lists, so I’ll use MAPLE.

The feedback for MAPLE shows:\n- M(-) - M is in the word but wrong position (not position 1)\n- A(-) - A is in the word but wrong position (not position 2)\n\nSo the pattern is:\n- P in position 3\n- L in position 4\n- E in position 5\n- A is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3,5 - impossible since positions 3,4,5 are taken. This suggests A must be in position 4, but position 4 is L.\n\nThis indicates the only possible word is _ A P L E, with A in position 2. Re-evaluating MAPLE feedback:\n- M(-) - M is in word but not position 1 (so M could be elsewhere)\n- A(-) - A is in word but not position 2\n- P(✓) - P in position 3\n- L(✓) - L in position 4\n- E(✓) - E in position 5\n\nThus the pattern is: _ _ P L E with A somewhere, but A cannot be in position 2. The only possible position for A is position 1, making the word A P P L E, but this would have two Ps, one confirmed in position 3, which would be invalid.\n\nLooking back, the only valid word that fits all constraints is APPLE (A P P L E), even though it has P in position 2 (which would normally be excluded), but since P is confirmed in position 3 and we have no rule against duplicate letters, APPLE is the only logical choice.\n\nHowever, since P is confirmed in position 3, the word must be _ _ P L E with A in position 1: A P P L E.\n\nBut this has P in both 2 and 3, which is possible. The word must be APPLE.\n\nWait - but MAPLE feedback shows P(✓) only in position 3, so P appears in position 3, and the word could have another P. The only possible word fitting all constraints is APPLE.Based on all the feedback, the only 5-letter word that fits the pattern is:\n\n<guess>APPLE</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: STALE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) L(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: MAPLE -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) P(✓) L(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 4: APPLE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(-) P(✓) L(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the four rounds we now know:

1. Pattern so far: A _ P L E  
   (A✓, P✓ in 3rd, L✓, E✓)

2. Additional constraints revealed by APPLE feedback:
   - First P (position 2) is marked “-”: P is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - Second P (position 3) is marked “✓”: P is in position 3 and correct.

Therefore the word contains exactly one P in position 3, and no duplicate P.

3. Eliminated letters (x): C, R, N, S, T  
   Partially placed letters:
   - M(-): M appears but not in position 1  
   - A(-): A appears but not in 2, 3, 4, 5 → already satisfied (A is in 1)  
   So M may still be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E) → positions 2 or 4.

4. Current fixed pattern: A _ P L E with the blank needing a consonant that is NOT C, R, N, S, T, and preferably testing new common consonants.

Candidate letters for position 2 (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z plus M (but M(-) says M could be here).

Valid English 5-letter words fitting A _ P L E:
- AMPLE → M is allowed in position 2 (since M(-) just says “not 1”), and all letters fit constraints.

No other common 5-letter word fits A _ P L E while satisfying all feedback.

Therefore the only remaining possibility is AMPLE.
