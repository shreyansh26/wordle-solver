1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Ideally, this word should include vowels and common consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly. A classic strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and frequently used consonants.

Common choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""AROSE"" contains five different common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all frequently found in English words. This should give good coverage and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback:  
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).  
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).  

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the eliminated ones).  

Since four common consonants are eliminated, I should try new consonants plus a vowel that isn’t A or O.  
A good next guess would use fresh consonants and possibly the vowels I, U, or Y.  
A balanced word could be ""INLET"": it has I, N, L, E, T.  
- E is already confirmed in the last spot.  
- The letters I, N, L, T haven’t been tested yet.  

Let’s try that.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. The word ends in **E** (from Guess 1).
2. Letter **I** is present but is NOT in position 1 (Guess 2 gave I(-)).
3. Letters **A, R, O, S, N, L, T** are NOT in the word.
4. Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z + vowels **E** (fixed last) and **I** (somewhere inside).

We still need four more consonants, and we must place **I** somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

A word that uses fresh consonants and tries **I** in position 2 is “CHIME”:
- C, H, M have not appeared yet.
- E is fixed at the end.
- I is in position 2, which is allowed because earlier feedback only said I is not in position 1.

This tests four new consonants (C, H, M) and puts I in a new spot.
