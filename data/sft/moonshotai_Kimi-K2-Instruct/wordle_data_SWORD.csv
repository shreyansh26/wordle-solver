- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us a lot of information by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (most common starting letter in English words)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing our chances of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Only the first letter is confirmed:
- Position 1 (S ✓) is correct.
- Letters L, A, T, E do not appear anywhere in the word.

Therefore every other position (2-5) must be filled with letters not yet tried. I need a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Does not contain L, A, T, E at all.
3. Uses new letters for positions 2-5.

Good next letters to try are common consonants and vowels like N, R, I, O, U, D, C, H, M, P, etc. One such 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding the eliminated letters, is “SOUND”.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. D is fixed in position 5 (✓).
3. O is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
4. Letters to exclude entirely: L, A, T, E (from guess 1) + U, N (from guess 2).

So the confirmed pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ D
with O somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 2).

Letters still allowed (besides S, O, D) come from the remaining alphabet: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus the eliminated ones).

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ _ _ D, includes O in position 3 or 4, and uses only the allowed letters.

One candidate is SWORD:
- S (fixed)  
- W (new letter)  
- O (must be here because it can’t be 2)  
- R (new letter)  
- D (fixed)

Wait, does SWORD contain any forbidden letters? No L, A, T, E, U, N. Looks good.

Another check: O is in position 3, so it’s not in position 2 (which matches the feedback that O is in the word but not in position 2).

So SWORD seems valid.
