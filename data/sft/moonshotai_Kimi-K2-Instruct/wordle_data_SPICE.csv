- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, E, O) and some high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- Each letter is distinct, making it easier to interpret feedback
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This approach gives us the best chance to identify at least one correct letter or eliminate several common letters early on.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓).

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains the letter S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or O.

We need a new five-letter English word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains S.
3. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Good candidate consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U, Y (since A and O are out).

Let’s try “STILE”:
- S (position 1) — we know S is in the word, but not necessarily here.
- T
- I
- L
- E (known in position 5)

This checks all constraints.
