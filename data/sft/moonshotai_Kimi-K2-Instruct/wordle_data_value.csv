For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:

- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

This gives me the best chance to identify multiple correct letters in the first guess.

From the feedback for AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct last position (✓).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).

So the target word ends in E, contains an A somewhere, and does **not** contain R, O, or S.

Next, we should try to test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y) while keeping the A and E constraints in mind. A good second guess could incorporate new consonants like T, N, L, D, C, etc.

A balanced choice is “CLEAN”:

Interpreting the new feedback:

Guess 2: CLEAN  
Feedback: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(-) N(x)

- E(-) → E is in the word but **not** in position 4 (we already knew it is in position 5, so this is consistent).
- A(-) → A is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- L(-) → L is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- C, N are **not** in the word (x).

Summary of constraints so far:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A and L.
- A is **not** 1st, 3rd, or 5th → must be 2nd or 4th.
- L is **not** 2nd → must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, C, N.

Possible positions:
1 _ _ _ E  
We need to place A and L under the above constraints and fill the remaining two spots with allowed letters.

Quick test:
- If A is 2nd: _ A _ _ E  
  L could be 3rd or 4th:  
  – _ A L _ E → choose 4th letter (not R,O,S,C,N, and not A,L,E).  
    Allowed: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.  
    Try a common consonant: B → B A L _ E → B A L T E? Not valid (5 unique letters).  
    Actually need 5-letter word. Let’s form: B A L L E → invalid (double L).  
    Try D A L E E → invalid (double E).  
    Try G A L E E → invalid.  
    Try H A L V E → valid word? No, HALVE is 5 letters. HALVE is valid, but L is 3rd, A is 2nd, matches constraints. Check letters: H, A, L, V, E. None of R,O,S,C,N. Good.

But we have to avoid any already ruled-out letters, and HALVE uses H, A, L, V, E — none forbidden. Also, A is 2nd (allowed), L is 3rd (allowed), E is 5th (required). This seems valid.

Let me double-check:  
Secret word constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A and L.
- No R,O,S,C,N.
- A not 1st,3rd,5th → A is 2nd here.
- L not 2nd → L is 3rd here.
All satisfied.

Another possibility: A in 4th, L in 1st.  
L _ _ A E  
Fill: L I D A E (LIDAE not word), L U G A E (LUGAE? no), L A M A E (Lamae? rare).  
HALVE seems safer.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants.

From the new feedback on HALVE:
- E(✓) in position 5 (we already knew this).
- A(✓) in position 2 (new locked position).
- L(✓) in position 3 (new locked position).
- V(-) means V is in the word but not in position 4.
- H(x) means H is NOT in the word.

So the current known pattern is:
- Position 1: ? (cannot be R, O, S, C, N, H)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: L (fixed)
- Position 4: ? (cannot be V, and must not be any of R, O, S, C, N, H)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

The word looks like: _ A L _ E where the blanks must be filled with allowed letters (not R, O, S, C, N, H, V).

Also, V must appear somewhere, but position 4 is already excluded. Since positions 2,3,5 are fixed with A,L,E, the only place V can go is position 1. So the word must start with V.

Thus the word is V A L _ E, and position 4 must be a letter not in our forbidden list (R,O,S,C,N,H,V). 

Allowed letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting V A L _ E:

- VALVE - but V is repeated and we already have V in position 1, and V is not allowed in position 4
- VALET - uses T which is allowed
- VALUE - uses U which is allowed
- VALVE - invalid (double V)
- VALSE - invalid (S is forbidden)
- VALKYRIE - too long

Between VALET and VALUE, both fit the constraints:
- VALET: V(✓) A(✓) L(✓) E(?) T(?) - but E is fixed at 5, so this would be VALET ending in T, E is 4th position which contradicts our E(✓) at 5. Wait no:

Actually, the word must be V A L _ E, so:
- VALET would be V A L E T - but this ends in T, not E, so invalid.
- VALUE would be V A L U E - this fits perfectly: V(1) A(2) L(3) U(4) E(5).

Check constraints:
- Ends with E: ✓
- Contains V: ✓ (position 1, which is allowed since V(-) meant not in 4)
- Contains A,L: ✓
- No forbidden letters: R,O,S,C,N,H not present ✓
