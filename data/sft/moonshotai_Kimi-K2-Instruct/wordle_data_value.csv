For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I, D, P, C, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to test many possibilities at once. Words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for testing letters in different positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
   - Letters definitely absent: R, I, S  
   - Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere, because E(✓) at the end in the first guess told us E is in the word and in its correct spot, but the second guess shows E(-) which means E is *in* the word but *not* at position 5 this time.  
   Wait, let's re-express the feedback correctly:

   - First guess: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
   - Second guess: E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   This is a contradiction unless I misread. Actually, in the second guess PANEL, the feedback is E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5, yet the first guess said E is in position 5. This implies the first feedback should be interpreted as E is in position 5 and is correct there, and the second feedback confirms E is elsewhere (but this can't be since a letter can't be in two positions). 

Re-evaluating: The feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct position and letter.
- - : letter exists but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

So:
- RAISE: E is in correct position (position 5).
- PANEL: E is in the word but not in position 5 (which contradicts E being in position 5 in RAISE). This suggests the feedback for PANEL must have E(x) or E(✓), but here it's E(-), which can't be since E must be at position 5. 

This indicates the feedback must have meant E(✓) in RAISE (correct at position 5), and in PANEL, E is at position 5 again, so it should have been E(✓). However, the given feedback is E(-), which is impossible if E is fixed at position 5. Therefore, the feedback must have been entered incorrectly, or perhaps the first feedback's E(✓) means E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5, and the second feedback's E(-) must be a typo and should be E(✓). 

But assuming the feedback is correct as given, the only resolution is that the first feedback's E(✓) was a mistake, and actually E is in the word but not at position 5. This is highly confusing. 

Let me proceed strictly with the feedback as given:
- RAISE: A(✓) at 2, E(✓) at 5 → Word is _ A _ _ E
- PANEL: P(x), A(✓) at 2, N(x), E(-), L(-)  
   - A is at 2 (matches)
   - E is in the word but not at 5 → but RAISE said E is at 5. This is impossible.

This suggests the feedback must have been intended as:
Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓) → E at position 5 is correct.
Guess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-) → E is in word but not at 5, which contradicts.

Given this, likely the feedback for PANEL's E should have been ✓, but it's written as (-). To resolve, I will assume that in PANEL, E(-) is a typo and should be E(✓), meaning E is at position 5. Then L(-) means L is in the word but not at position 4.

So correcting:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: A at 2, E at 5
- Letters not in word: R, I, S, P, N
- Letters in word but position unknown: L

Now we need a word matching _ A _ _ E, containing L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and avoiding R, I, S, P, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but limited by word constraints).

Looking for _A__E with L in 1, 3, or 4:
- L A _ _ E: L must be at 1 → LA__E. Possible: LADLE (but D is fine), LAMPE (P is out), LANCE (N is out), LADLE is possible (L,A,D,L,E) but L appears twice and is fine.
- _ A L _ E: _A_L_E → FABLE (B is ok), CABLE (C, B ok), GABLE (G ok), TABLE (T ok)
- _ A _ L E: _A_LE → MALLE (invalid), CALLE (invalid), TALLE (invalid), DALLE (invalid), HALLE (invalid). Not common words.
  
Best options: FABLE, CABLE, GABLE, TABLE, LADLE.

Check letters:
- FABLE: F, A, B, L, E → avoids R, I, S, P, N; has L at 4; valid 5-letter word.
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → same.
- GABLE: G, A, B, L, E → same.
- TABLE: T, A, B, L, E → same.
- LADLE: L, A, D, L, E → has L at 1 and 4; D is unused; valid.

I will choose TABLE as it tests T, which is common, and follows constraints.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but limited by word constraints).

Looking for _A__E with L in 1, 3, or 4:
- L A _ _ E: L must be at 1 → LA__E. Possible: LADLE (but D is fine), LAMPE (P is out), LANCE (N is out), LADLE is possible (L,A,D,L,E) but L appears twice and is fine.
- _ A L _ E: _A_L_E → FABLE (B is ok), CABLE (C, B ok), GABLE (G ok), TABLE (T ok)
- _ A _ L E: _A_LE → MALLE (invalid), CALLE (invalid), TALLE (invalid), DALLE (invalid), HALLE (invalid). Not common words.
  
Best options: FABLE, CABLE, GABLE, TABLE, LADLE.

Check letters:
- FABLE: F, A, B, L, E → avoids R, I, S, P, N; has L at 4; valid 5-letter word.
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → same.
- GABLE: G, A, B, L, E → same.
- TABLE: T, A, B, L, E → same.
- LADLE: L, A, D, L, E → has L at 1 and 4; D is unused; valid.

I will choose TABLE as it tests T, which is common, and follows constraints.",Guess 3: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,value,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I, D, P, C, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to test many possibilities at once. Words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for testing letters in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(x) → R is **not** in the word at all.
- A(✓) → A is in the word **and correctly placed** at position 2 (index 1).
- I(x) → I is **not** in the word.
- S(x) → S is **not** in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word **and correctly placed** at position 5 (index 4).

So the word pattern so far is: _ A _ _ E

Letters we know are **NOT** in the word: R, I, S.

Letters we know **ARE** in the word: A (position 2), E (position 5).

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 2nd position and E in the 5th position.
- Does **not** contain R, I, or S.
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- B A _ _ E → BAGEL (but G is less common, and L is okay) → BAGEL has S which is invalid
- C A _ _ E → CABLE (B and L are common, but we've excluded R) → CABLE is valid but has B, L, E already confirmed
- C A R _ E → but R is invalid
- M A _ _ E → MAPLE (P and L are good, but contains P and L)
- G A _ _ E → GAMER (but R is invalid)
- T A _ _ E → TAWSE (but S is invalid)
- P A _ _ E → PANEL (N and L are common and not yet tested, and no invalid letters)

PANEL fits:
- A is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters P, A, N, E, L: none are R, I, or S

<guess>PANEL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
   - Letters definitely absent: R, I, S  
   - Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere, because E(✓) at the end in the first guess told us E is in the word and in its correct spot, but the second guess shows E(-) which means E is *in* the word but *not* at position 5 this time.  
   Wait, let's re-express the feedback correctly:

   - First guess: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
   - Second guess: E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   This is a contradiction unless I misread. Actually, in the second guess PANEL, the feedback is E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5, yet the first guess said E is in position 5. This implies the first feedback should be interpreted as E is in position 5 and is correct there, and the second feedback confirms E is elsewhere (but this can't be since a letter can't be in two positions). 

Re-evaluating: The feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct position and letter.
- - : letter exists but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

So:
- RAISE: E is in correct position (position 5).
- PANEL: E is in the word but not in position 5 (which contradicts E being in position 5 in RAISE). This suggests the feedback for PANEL must have E(x) or E(✓), but here it's E(-), which can't be since E must be at position 5. 

This indicates the feedback must have meant E(✓) in RAISE (correct at position 5), and in PANEL, E is at position 5 again, so it should have been E(✓). However, the given feedback is E(-), which is impossible if E is fixed at position 5. Therefore, the feedback must have been entered incorrectly, or perhaps the first feedback's E(✓) means E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5, and the second feedback's E(-) must be a typo and should be E(✓). 

But assuming the feedback is correct as given, the only resolution is that the first feedback's E(✓) was a mistake, and actually E is in the word but not at position 5. This is highly confusing. 

Let me proceed strictly with the feedback as given:
- RAISE: A(✓) at 2, E(✓) at 5 → Word is _ A _ _ E
- PANEL: P(x), A(✓) at 2, N(x), E(-), L(-)  
   - A is at 2 (matches)
   - E is in the word but not at 5 → but RAISE said E is at 5. This is impossible.

This suggests the feedback must have been intended as:
Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓) → E at position 5 is correct.
Guess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-) → E is in word but not at 5, which contradicts.

Given this, likely the feedback for PANEL's E should have been ✓, but it's written as (-). To resolve, I will assume that in PANEL, E(-) is a typo and should be E(✓), meaning E is at position 5. Then L(-) means L is in the word but not at position 4.

So correcting:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: A at 2, E at 5
- Letters not in word: R, I, S, P, N
- Letters in word but position unknown: L

Now we need a word matching _ A _ _ E, containing L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and avoiding R, I, S, P, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but limited by word constraints).

Looking for _A__E with L in 1, 3, or 4:
- L A _ _ E: L must be at 1 → LA__E. Possible: LADLE (but D is fine), LAMPE (P is out), LANCE (N is out), LADLE is possible (L,A,D,L,E) but L appears twice and is fine.
- _ A L _ E: _A_L_E → FABLE (B is ok), CABLE (C, B ok), GABLE (G ok), TABLE (T ok)
- _ A _ L E: _A_LE → MALLE (invalid), CALLE (invalid), TALLE (invalid), DALLE (invalid), HALLE (invalid). Not common words.
  
Best options: FABLE, CABLE, GABLE, TABLE, LADLE.

Check letters:
- FABLE: F, A, B, L, E → avoids R, I, S, P, N; has L at 4; valid 5-letter word.
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → same.
- GABLE: G, A, B, L, E → same.
- TABLE: T, A, B, L, E → same.
- LADLE: L, A, D, L, E → has L at 1 and 4; D is unused; valid.

I will choose TABLE as it tests T, which is common, and follows constraints.

Let's extract the reliable facts from the three rounds of feedback.

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
- A is in position 2.  
- E is in position 5.  
- R, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 2: PANEL  
P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-)  
- Confirms A is in position 2 (no new info).  
- E is in the word but *not* in position 5.  
- P and N are not in the word.  
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: TABLE  
T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)  
- Again confirms A in position 2.  
- B is not in the word.  
- L is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is in position 5.

Summary of constraints
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
- Letters absent: R, I, S, P, N, T, B  
- Letters present (positions unknown): L (cannot be at 4)  
- A fixed at 2, E fixed at 5.

So L must appear at position 1 or 3.

Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but avoiding the banned list.

Candidate words with pattern _A__E, containing L in 1 or 3 and avoiding all banned letters:

LA__E (L at 1):
LADLE, LAMPE, LANCE, …  
- LADLE: uses L twice; second L is in position 4 – but L(-) in TABLE says L is *not* at 4, so okay (the second L is at 4 and must be wrong position). Actually, the feedback only said L is *not* in position 4, it doesn't forbid duplicate Ls. However, LADLE uses L twice, and English words rarely have the same letter in both positions 1 and 4 in a 5-letter word. Let's keep it as a possibility.

LABLE: uses B (banned).  
LADLE: D okay, but check: positions 2A, 5E, L at 1 and 4. L at 4 conflicts with L(-), so LADLE is invalid.

LA_D_E positions: L A _ D E → LADDE not a word.

LA__E without banned letters:  
LAGER: G okay, but R is banned → out.  
LAKER: R banned.  
LADER: R banned.  
LAZED: Z okay, but D okay, E okay, but uses Z which is less common.

_A_L_E (L at 3):
DALLE: use D, A, L, L, E → but double L and E at 5; L at 3 is okay, second L at 4 conflicts with L(-) → invalid.  
CALLE: C okay, but double L again.  
HALLE: same issue.  
FALLE: same.  
MALLE: same.

Single-L candidates with L at 3:
CABLE: used B (banned).  
FABLE: used B (banned).  
MAPLE: P banned.  
GABLE: B banned.  
GALET: T banned.  
MALTE: T banned.  
VALET: T banned.  
DALES: S banned.  
HALVE: V okay, but no L in word.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: same.

Realizing we need L only once, at positions 1 or 3, and letters unused.

LAKE_: K okay, E okay, but pattern _A_KE doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LA_ _E:  
LACED: D okay, C okay, but pattern _AC_E → doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LAGER: R banned.  
LABEL: B banned.

Alternative:  
L A C E E → invalid (double E).  
L A D E E → invalid.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.  
L A M E R → R banned.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.

Wait, let me list viable _A_L_E words with L at 3 and no banned letters.

Letters available for positions 1, 3, 4: excluding R,I,S,P,N,T,B.

So positions 1,3,4 must be from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}. But L must be at 1 or 3.

Case 1: L at 1 → L A _ _ E  
Need letters 3 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} (excluding already banned).  
Valid combinations:  
L A C K E → LACK E → LACKE not a word.  
L A C E D → LACED but pattern _ACED. No, position 4 must be E, so _ACKE invalid.  
Wait, we need _ A _ _ E with L at 1 → L A _ _ E. Third letter any allowed, fourth any allowed.  
L A D G E → LADGE → no, not a word.  
L A D L E → LADLE (but L at 4 conflicts).  
L A M E D → no.  
L A C E S → S banned.  
L A C H E → LACHE not common.  
L A M E D → no.  
L A M E R → R banned.

Case 2: L at 3 → _ A L _ E  
Letters 1 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} excluding banned.  
Valid words:  
C A L V E → CALVE (V okay)  
D A L L E → DALLE (double L, but second L at 4 conflicts).  
F A L C E → FALCE not a word.  
F A L L E → FALLS (S banned).  
G A L L E → GALLE (L at 4 conflicts).  
H A L V E → HALVE (but V okay, but no L in word).  
H A L L E → same issue.  
M A L L E → same issue.  
C A L M E → CALME not a word.  
C A L V E → CALVE.  
F A L S E → S banned.  
G A L L E → same issue.  
D A L E S → S banned.  
M A L E D → no.  
M A L E D → pattern mismatch.  
V A L L E → same issue.

Best candidate left: CALVE or HALVE, but HALVE doesn’t use L in correct position.  
CALVE: C A L V E  
- L is at position 3 (allowed).  
- V at 4 is unused.  
- Letters: C, A, L, V, E — none are banned.  
- Pattern _ A L _ E matches.  

Check constraints again:  
- _ A _ _ E  
- L must be at 1 or 3 → CALVE has L at 3.  
- No banned letters.  
- CALVE is a valid word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CALVE.

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
- Letters absent: R, I, S, P, N, T, B  
- Letters present (positions unknown): L (cannot be at 4)  
- A fixed at 2, E fixed at 5.

So L must appear at position 1 or 3.

Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but avoiding the banned list.

Candidate words with pattern _A__E, containing L in 1 or 3 and avoiding all banned letters:

LA__E (L at 1):
LADLE, LAMPE, LANCE, …  
- LADLE: uses L twice; second L is in position 4 – but L(-) in TABLE says L is *not* at 4, so okay (the second L is at 4 and must be wrong position). Actually, the feedback only said L is *not* in position 4, it doesn't forbid duplicate Ls. However, LADLE uses L twice, and English words rarely have the same letter in both positions 1 and 4 in a 5-letter word. Let's keep it as a possibility.

LABLE: uses B (banned).  
LADLE: D okay, but check: positions 2A, 5E, L at 1 and 4. L at 4 conflicts with L(-), so LADLE is invalid.

LA_D_E positions: L A _ D E → LADDE not a word.

LA__E without banned letters:  
LAGER: G okay, but R is banned → out.  
LAKER: R banned.  
LADER: R banned.  
LAZED: Z okay, but D okay, E okay, but uses Z which is less common.

_A_L_E (L at 3):
DALLE: use D, A, L, L, E → but double L and E at 5; L at 3 is okay, second L at 4 conflicts with L(-) → invalid.  
CALLE: C okay, but double L again.  
HALLE: same issue.  
FALLE: same.  
MALLE: same.

Single-L candidates with L at 3:
CABLE: used B (banned).  
FABLE: used B (banned).  
MAPLE: P banned.  
GABLE: B banned.  
GALET: T banned.  
MALTE: T banned.  
VALET: T banned.  
DALES: S banned.  
HALVE: V okay, but no L in word.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: same.

Realizing we need L only once, at positions 1 or 3, and letters unused.

LAKE_: K okay, E okay, but pattern _A_KE doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LA_ _E:  
LACED: D okay, C okay, but pattern _AC_E → doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LAGER: R banned.  
LABEL: B banned.

Alternative:  
L A C E E → invalid (double E).  
L A D E E → invalid.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.  
L A M E R → R banned.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.

Wait, let me list viable _A_L_E words with L at 3 and no banned letters.

Letters available for positions 1, 3, 4: excluding R,I,S,P,N,T,B.

So positions 1,3,4 must be from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}. But L must be at 1 or 3.

Case 1: L at 1 → L A _ _ E  
Need letters 3 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} (excluding already banned).  
Valid combinations:  
L A C K E → LACK E → LACKE not a word.  
L A C E D → LACED but pattern _ACED. No, position 4 must be E, so _ACKE invalid.  
Wait, we need _ A _ _ E with L at 1 → L A _ _ E. Third letter any allowed, fourth any allowed.  
L A D G E → LADGE → no, not a word.  
L A D L E → LADLE (but L at 4 conflicts).  
L A M E D → no.  
L A C E S → S banned.  
L A C H E → LACHE not common.  
L A M E D → no.  
L A M E R → R banned.

Case 2: L at 3 → _ A L _ E  
Letters 1 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} excluding banned.  
Valid words:  
C A L V E → CALVE (V okay)  
D A L L E → DALLE (double L, but second L at 4 conflicts).  
F A L C E → FALCE not a word.  
F A L L E → FALLS (S banned).  
G A L L E → GALLE (L at 4 conflicts).  
H A L V E → HALVE (but V okay, but no L in word).  
H A L L E → same issue.  
M A L L E → same issue.  
C A L M E → CALME not a word.  
C A L V E → CALVE.  
F A L S E → S banned.  
G A L L E → same issue.  
D A L E S → S banned.  
M A L E D → no.  
M A L E D → pattern mismatch.  
V A L L E → same issue.

Best candidate left: CALVE or HALVE, but HALVE doesn’t use L in correct position.  
CALVE: C A L V E  
- L is at position 3 (allowed).  
- V at 4 is unused.  
- Letters: C, A, L, V, E — none are banned.  
- Pattern _ A L _ E matches.  

Check constraints again:  
- _ A _ _ E  
- L must be at 1 or 3 → CALVE has L at 3.  
- No banned letters.  
- CALVE is a valid word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CALVE.",Guess 4: CALVE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) L(✓) V(-) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,value,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I, D, P, C, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to test many possibilities at once. Words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for testing letters in different positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(x) → R is **not** in the word at all.
- A(✓) → A is in the word **and correctly placed** at position 2 (index 1).
- I(x) → I is **not** in the word.
- S(x) → S is **not** in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word **and correctly placed** at position 5 (index 4).

So the word pattern so far is: _ A _ _ E

Letters we know are **NOT** in the word: R, I, S.

Letters we know **ARE** in the word: A (position 2), E (position 5).

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 2nd position and E in the 5th position.
- Does **not** contain R, I, or S.
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- B A _ _ E → BAGEL (but G is less common, and L is okay) → BAGEL has S which is invalid
- C A _ _ E → CABLE (B and L are common, but we've excluded R) → CABLE is valid but has B, L, E already confirmed
- C A R _ E → but R is invalid
- M A _ _ E → MAPLE (P and L are good, but contains P and L)
- G A _ _ E → GAMER (but R is invalid)
- T A _ _ E → TAWSE (but S is invalid)
- P A _ _ E → PANEL (N and L are common and not yet tested, and no invalid letters)

PANEL fits:
- A is in position 2
- E is in position 5
- Letters P, A, N, E, L: none are R, I, or S

<guess>PANEL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
   - Letters definitely absent: R, I, S  
   - Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere, because E(✓) at the end in the first guess told us E is in the word and in its correct spot, but the second guess shows E(-) which means E is *in* the word but *not* at position 5 this time.  
   Wait, let's re-express the feedback correctly:

   - First guess: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
   - Second guess: E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   This is a contradiction unless I misread. Actually, in the second guess PANEL, the feedback is E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5, yet the first guess said E is in position 5. This implies the first feedback should be interpreted as E is in position 5 and is correct there, and the second feedback confirms E is elsewhere (but this can't be since a letter can't be in two positions). 

Re-evaluating: The feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct position and letter.
- - : letter exists but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

So:
- RAISE: E is in correct position (position 5).
- PANEL: E is in the word but not in position 5 (which contradicts E being in position 5 in RAISE). This suggests the feedback for PANEL must have E(x) or E(✓), but here it's E(-), which can't be since E must be at position 5. 

This indicates the feedback must have meant E(✓) in RAISE (correct at position 5), and in PANEL, E is at position 5 again, so it should have been E(✓). However, the given feedback is E(-), which is impossible if E is fixed at position 5. Therefore, the feedback must have been entered incorrectly, or perhaps the first feedback's E(✓) means E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5, and the second feedback's E(-) must be a typo and should be E(✓). 

But assuming the feedback is correct as given, the only resolution is that the first feedback's E(✓) was a mistake, and actually E is in the word but not at position 5. This is highly confusing. 

Let me proceed strictly with the feedback as given:
- RAISE: A(✓) at 2, E(✓) at 5 → Word is _ A _ _ E
- PANEL: P(x), A(✓) at 2, N(x), E(-), L(-)  
   - A is at 2 (matches)
   - E is in the word but not at 5 → but RAISE said E is at 5. This is impossible.

This suggests the feedback must have been intended as:
Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓) → E at position 5 is correct.
Guess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-) → E is in word but not at 5, which contradicts.

Given this, likely the feedback for PANEL's E should have been ✓, but it's written as (-). To resolve, I will assume that in PANEL, E(-) is a typo and should be E(✓), meaning E is at position 5. Then L(-) means L is in the word but not at position 4.

So correcting:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: A at 2, E at 5
- Letters not in word: R, I, S, P, N
- Letters in word but position unknown: L

Now we need a word matching _ A _ _ E, containing L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and avoiding R, I, S, P, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but limited by word constraints).

Looking for _A__E with L in 1, 3, or 4:
- L A _ _ E: L must be at 1 → LA__E. Possible: LADLE (but D is fine), LAMPE (P is out), LANCE (N is out), LADLE is possible (L,A,D,L,E) but L appears twice and is fine.
- _ A L _ E: _A_L_E → FABLE (B is ok), CABLE (C, B ok), GABLE (G ok), TABLE (T ok)
- _ A _ L E: _A_LE → MALLE (invalid), CALLE (invalid), TALLE (invalid), DALLE (invalid), HALLE (invalid). Not common words.
  
Best options: FABLE, CABLE, GABLE, TABLE, LADLE.

Check letters:
- FABLE: F, A, B, L, E → avoids R, I, S, P, N; has L at 4; valid 5-letter word.
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → same.
- GABLE: G, A, B, L, E → same.
- TABLE: T, A, B, L, E → same.
- LADLE: L, A, D, L, E → has L at 1 and 4; D is unused; valid.

I will choose TABLE as it tests T, which is common, and follows constraints.

<guess>TABLE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PANEL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-)
Guess 3: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's extract the reliable facts from the three rounds of feedback.

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
- A is in position 2.  
- E is in position 5.  
- R, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 2: PANEL  
P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-)  
- Confirms A is in position 2 (no new info).  
- E is in the word but *not* in position 5.  
- P and N are not in the word.  
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: TABLE  
T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)  
- Again confirms A in position 2.  
- B is not in the word.  
- L is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E is in position 5.

Summary of constraints
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E  
- Letters absent: R, I, S, P, N, T, B  
- Letters present (positions unknown): L (cannot be at 4)  
- A fixed at 2, E fixed at 5.

So L must appear at position 1 or 3.

Letters still available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but avoiding the banned list.

Candidate words with pattern _A__E, containing L in 1 or 3 and avoiding all banned letters:

LA__E (L at 1):
LADLE, LAMPE, LANCE, …  
- LADLE: uses L twice; second L is in position 4 – but L(-) in TABLE says L is *not* at 4, so okay (the second L is at 4 and must be wrong position). Actually, the feedback only said L is *not* in position 4, it doesn't forbid duplicate Ls. However, LADLE uses L twice, and English words rarely have the same letter in both positions 1 and 4 in a 5-letter word. Let's keep it as a possibility.

LABLE: uses B (banned).  
LADLE: D okay, but check: positions 2A, 5E, L at 1 and 4. L at 4 conflicts with L(-), so LADLE is invalid.

LA_D_E positions: L A _ D E → LADDE not a word.

LA__E without banned letters:  
LAGER: G okay, but R is banned → out.  
LAKER: R banned.  
LADER: R banned.  
LAZED: Z okay, but D okay, E okay, but uses Z which is less common.

_A_L_E (L at 3):
DALLE: use D, A, L, L, E → but double L and E at 5; L at 3 is okay, second L at 4 conflicts with L(-) → invalid.  
CALLE: C okay, but double L again.  
HALLE: same issue.  
FALLE: same.  
MALLE: same.

Single-L candidates with L at 3:
CABLE: used B (banned).  
FABLE: used B (banned).  
MAPLE: P banned.  
GABLE: B banned.  
GALET: T banned.  
MALTE: T banned.  
VALET: T banned.  
DALES: S banned.  
HALVE: V okay, but no L in word.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: R banned.  
HALER: same.

Realizing we need L only once, at positions 1 or 3, and letters unused.

LAKE_: K okay, E okay, but pattern _A_KE doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LA_ _E:  
LACED: D okay, C okay, but pattern _AC_E → doesn’t fit _A__E.  
LAGER: R banned.  
LABEL: B banned.

Alternative:  
L A C E E → invalid (double E).  
L A D E E → invalid.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.  
L A M E R → R banned.  
L A M E D → pattern mismatch.

Wait, let me list viable _A_L_E words with L at 3 and no banned letters.

Letters available for positions 1, 3, 4: excluding R,I,S,P,N,T,B.

So positions 1,3,4 must be from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}. But L must be at 1 or 3.

Case 1: L at 1 → L A _ _ E  
Need letters 3 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} (excluding already banned).  
Valid combinations:  
L A C K E → LACK E → LACKE not a word.  
L A C E D → LACED but pattern _ACED. No, position 4 must be E, so _ACKE invalid.  
Wait, we need _ A _ _ E with L at 1 → L A _ _ E. Third letter any allowed, fourth any allowed.  
L A D G E → LADGE → no, not a word.  
L A D L E → LADLE (but L at 4 conflicts).  
L A M E D → no.  
L A C E S → S banned.  
L A C H E → LACHE not common.  
L A M E D → no.  
L A M E R → R banned.

Case 2: L at 3 → _ A L _ E  
Letters 1 and 4 from {C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} excluding banned.  
Valid words:  
C A L V E → CALVE (V okay)  
D A L L E → DALLE (double L, but second L at 4 conflicts).  
F A L C E → FALCE not a word.  
F A L L E → FALLS (S banned).  
G A L L E → GALLE (L at 4 conflicts).  
H A L V E → HALVE (but V okay, but no L in word).  
H A L L E → same issue.  
M A L L E → same issue.  
C A L M E → CALME not a word.  
C A L V E → CALVE.  
F A L S E → S banned.  
G A L L E → same issue.  
D A L E S → S banned.  
M A L E D → no.  
M A L E D → pattern mismatch.  
V A L L E → same issue.

Best candidate left: CALVE or HALVE, but HALVE doesn’t use L in correct position.  
CALVE: C A L V E  
- L is at position 3 (allowed).  
- V at 4 is unused.  
- Letters: C, A, L, V, E — none are banned.  
- Pattern _ A L _ E matches.  

Check constraints again:  
- _ A _ _ E  
- L must be at 1 or 3 → CALVE has L at 3.  
- No banned letters.  
- CALVE is a valid word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CALVE.

This implies the first feedback should be interpreted as E is in position 5 and is correct there, and the second feedback confirms E is elsewhere (but this can't be since a letter can't be in two positions). \n\nRe-evaluating: The feedback symbols:\n- ✓ : correct position and letter.\n- - : letter exists but wrong position.\n- x : letter not in word.\n\nSo:\n- RAISE: E is in correct position (position 5).\n- PANEL: E is in the word but not in position 5 (which contradicts E being in position 5 in RAISE). This suggests the feedback for PANEL must have E(x) or E(✓), but here it's E(-), which can't be since E must be at position 5. \n\nThis indicates the feedback must have meant E(✓) in RAISE (correct at position 5), and in PANEL, E is at position 5 again, so it should have been E(✓). However, the given feedback is E(-), which is impossible if E is fixed at position 5. Therefore, the feedback must have been entered incorrectly, or perhaps the first feedback's E(✓) means E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5, and the second feedback's E(-) must be a typo and should be E(✓). \n\nBut assuming the feedback is correct as given, the only resolution is that the first feedback's E(✓) was a mistake, and actually E is in the word but not at position 5. This is highly confusing. \n\nLet me proceed strictly with the feedback as given:\n- RAISE: A(✓) at 2, E(✓) at 5 → Word is _ A _ _ E\n- PANEL: P(x), A(✓) at 2, N(x), E(-), L(-)  \n   - A is at 2 (matches)\n   - E is in the word but not at 5 → but RAISE said E is at 5. This is impossible.\n\nThis suggests the feedback must have been intended as:\nGuess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓) → E at position 5 is correct.\nGuess 2: PANEL → P(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) L(-) → E is in word but not at 5, which contradicts.\n\nGiven this, likely the feedback for PANEL's E should have been ✓, but it's written as (-). To resolve, I will assume that in PANEL, E(-) is a typo and should be E(✓), meaning E is at position 5. Then L(-) means L is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nSo correcting:\n- Word pattern: _ A _ _ E\n- Letters confirmed: A at 2, E at 5\n- Letters not in word: R, I, S, P, N\n- Letters in word but position unknown: L\n\nNow we need a word matching _ A _ _ E, containing L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and avoiding R, I, S, P, N.\n\nPossible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but limited by word constraints).\n\nLooking for _A__E with L in 1, 3, or 4:\n- L A _ _ E: L must be at 1 → LA__E.
