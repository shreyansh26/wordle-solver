- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain about which letters are in the word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels like A or E
2. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, or L
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of common letters without repeats.

Current constraints gathered from the two guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, N, L  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: O, E, T, and E is correctly placed in position 4, T in position 5.
3. Letters whose positions are still unknown: O is in the word but not in position 1 or 3 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).

So the word ends in “ET.”  
We still need the first three letters.  
The remaining pool of letters that have not been ruled out includes: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-known O and E, T.

We also know:
- O is somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5, but 4 and 5 are already taken by E and T, so O must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern must be: _ O _ E T

Now we just need a first letter and a third letter.  
Common consonants that have not yet been tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Let’s pick a frequent consonant for the first spot and a common vowel or consonant for the third.  
A good candidate: “COMET” – but N and L have been ruled out, so not those.  
Actually, “COMET” contains M (allowed), O in position 2 (required), E and T in correct spots.  
Let me check: C, O, M, E, T – none of C, M are forbidden.  
Also, O is in position 2 which satisfies the feedback.

So “COMET” seems valid.
