This is my first guess, so I don't have any prior information about the secret word. A good starting word should contain common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters
2. All letters are among the most common in English
3. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test many vowels at once
4. The consonants R and S are also very common

This should give me good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the known O in third position.
2. Introduce several new common consonants and possibly a vowel if one remains useful.

Popular high-frequency letters still available include T, N, L, C, D, P, U, I. I’ll pick a word that tests as many of these as possible while keeping O in the third spot.

Good candidates: “COUNT”, “POINT”, “MOUNT”, “JOINT”.

From the two past guesses we now know:

1. The word is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked at position 3).
2. The letters A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T are **not** in the word at all.
3. The letter O **is** in the word, but it is **not** in position 3 — the feedback for POINT shows O(-), which means O appears somewhere else in the word (it must be in position 1, 2, 4 or 5).

Therefore the pattern is now: O can be in any position except 3, and positions 1,2,4,5 may be any letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A,R,S,E,P,I,N,T).

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus the relocated O.

I need a valid 5-letter English word that uses some of these remaining letters and places O somewhere other than position 3. A good choice should test several new consonants and keep O in a new spot.

- C, L, U, D are all still possible.
- Places O in position 2, satisfying the new requirement.

Let’s tabulate the new information:

- C is in the word but **not** in position 1 (feedback “-”).
- L is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 2).

- O is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 3).

- U is **not** in the word (x).
- D is **not** in the word (x).

Letters already ruled out in any position: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D.  
Letters already locked in: L at 2, O at 3.  
Still-possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5 come from the remaining alphabet: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-seen C, but C cannot sit at 1 because it was marked “-” at position 1).

We also know C **is** in the word, so it must occupy position 4 or 5.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
- keeps the fixed L O at 2-3,
- tests the now-certain C in position 4 or 5,
- introduces several new letters.

Let’s try BLOCK:
- B and K are fresh letters.
- C is tried in position 4 (compatible with earlier “C is in word but not at 1”), and
- we already know L is fixed at 2 and O at 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I don't have any prior information about the secret word. A good starting word should contain common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters
2. All letters are among the most common in English
3. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test many vowels at once
4. The consonants R and S are also very common

This should give me good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the target word has the form _ _ O _ _ and its remaining letters are drawn from the set {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} (missing A, R, S, E).

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the known O in third position.
2. Introduce several new common consonants and possibly a vowel if one remains useful.

Popular high-frequency letters still available include T, N, L, C, D, P, U, I. I’ll pick a word that tests as many of these as possible while keeping O in the third spot.

Good candidates: “COUNT”, “POINT”, “MOUNT”, “JOINT”.
Let’s go with “POINT” because it checks P, I, N, T and keeps the O in place.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two past guesses we now know:

1. The word is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked at position 3).
2. The letters A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T are **not** in the word at all.
3. The letter O **is** in the word, but it is **not** in position 3 — the feedback for POINT shows O(-), which means O appears somewhere else in the word (it must be in position 1, 2, 4 or 5).

Therefore the pattern is now: O can be in any position except 3, and positions 1,2,4,5 may be any letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A,R,S,E,P,I,N,T).

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus the relocated O.

I need a valid 5-letter English word that uses some of these remaining letters and places O somewhere other than position 3. A good choice should test several new consonants and keep O in a new spot.

Let’s try “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are all still possible.
- Places O in position 2, satisfying the new requirement.
- Word is common and valid.

If any of C, L, U, D are present we’ll pinpoint them; if not, we’ll still learn four more absent letters.
