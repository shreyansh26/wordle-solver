For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants early. A good starting word often includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting guess because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). This is also highly effective.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) – the letter A exists in the secret word but is NOT in position 1.  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
E(-) – the letter E exists in the secret word but is NOT in position 5.

So the secret word contains two vowels: A and E, and possibly other consonants we haven’t tested yet.  
We know positions 1 and 5 are not A and E respectively, and we can exclude R, O, S.

Next move: pick a word that keeps A and E but places them in positions 2–4, and introduces new high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried yet (T, N, L, C, M, etc.).

A good candidate: “TWEAK”
– T and W are new consonants.  
– E is in a new position.  
– A is in a new position.  
– K gives us another fresh consonant.

This should quickly narrow down possible remaining consonants and confirm the positions of A and E.

A good starting word often includes:\n- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)\n- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)\n\nThe word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting guess because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.\n\nHowever, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). This is also highly effective.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers the most common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n\nA(-) – the letter A exists in the secret word but is NOT in position 1.  \nR(x) – R is not in the word at all.  \nO(x) – O is not in the word at all.  \nS(x) – S is not in the word at all.  \nE(-) – the letter E exists in the secret word but is NOT in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word contains two vowels: A and E, and possibly other consonants we haven’t tested yet.  \nWe know positions 1 and 5 are not A and E respectively, and we can exclude R, O, S.\n\nNext move: pick a word that keeps A and E but places them in positions 2–4, and introduces new high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried yet (T, N, L, C, M, etc.).\n\nA good candidate: “TWEAK”\n– T and W are new consonants.  \n– E is in a new position.  \n– A is in a new position.  \n– K gives us another fresh consonant.\n\nThis should quickly narrow down possible remaining consonants and confirm the positions of A and E.\n\n<guess>TWEAK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TWEAK -> FEEDBACK: T(x) W(x) E(-) A(✓) K(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on TWEAK:\n\nT(x) – T is not in the word.  \nW(x) – W is not in the word.  \nE(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3.  \nA(✓) – A is in the word AND is in position 4.  \nK(-) – K is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo far we know:\n\n1.

Current known facts:

1. A is in position 4.  
2. K is in the word and NOT in position 5 (from KNEAD feedback: K(✓) means it is in the correct spot, so K is in position 1).  
3. E is in the word and NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
   - In KNEAD, E was in position 3 and produced E(-), confirming E is NOT allowed in position 3.  
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from TWEAK feedback).  
   - So E must be in position 2.  
4. From KNEAD, N and D are not in the word.  
5. Banned letters so far: R, O, S, T, W, N, D.  

Therefore, the word structure is:

K (position 1)  
E (position 2)  
? (position 3)  
A (position 4)  
? (position 5, cannot be E or any banned letters above)

Remaining possible consonants for positions 3 and 5 (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.  

Let’s choose a word that fills positions 3 and 5 with new letters not yet used.  

A good candidate: KEBAB  
- K in position 1, E in position 2, A in position 4 are correct.  
- B in positions 3 and 5 are new letters to test.  

This tests B in both positions 3 and 5. If B is correct in either spot, we’ll know immediately.
