- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Good starting words often contain vowels (especially A, E, I) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).

Some strong opening words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (great for vowels but lacks common consonants)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, SLATE seems particularly good because it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T and E (both extremely common)

This gives us coverage of key letters across different positions. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback:
- S and L are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-).

So the pattern we have is:
_ _ A _ _

And we know:
- T and E are in the word, but not at positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Avoid S and L.

Therefore, T and E must occupy positions 1, 2, or 4 (with E not being last and T not being fourth). 

Possible placements:
- T could be at 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is E's original spot, and E can't be there)
- E could be at 1, 2, or 4

Common words fitting _ _ A _ _ with T and E:
Let's try CRATE: C(1) R(2) A(3) T(4) E(5) - but T can't be 4, and E can't be 5.

Try HEART: H(1) E(2) A(3) R(4) T(5) - E is at position 2, T at 5. This fits the constraints:
- A is correct at 3
- E is in word but not at 5 (it's at 2)
- T is in word but not at 4 (it's at 5)
- No S or L

HEART seems like a good next guess.
