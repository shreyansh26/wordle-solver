For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat letters (to maximize information gained)

Some good starting options include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)

I think SLATE is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word.

- S: NOT in the word (x)
- L: IS in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: NOT in the word (x)
- T: NOT in the word (x)
- E: NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
- No S, A, T, E
- L appears somewhere, just not in the 2nd position
- We need a 5-letter word that contains L (but not in 2nd spot) and avoids S, A, T, E

Next I should pick a word that:
- Incorporates the known L in another position
- Introduces several new common letters we haven’t tested yet
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Good fresh letters to test: R, N, O, I, C, D, M, P, U, B, etc.

Possible candidates:
- DRILL – uses L twice and new letters D, R, I
- GOLLY – uses L twice and G, O, Y
- FLUNK – uses L and F, U, N, K

I like DRILL because it:
- Moves L to position 3
- Adds common consonants D, R
- Adds common vowel I
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Repeats L to check for double L quickly

Current deductions:

Letters:
- L appears twice: position 4 confirmed (✓ from DRILL), and one more L elsewhere.
- O is in the word and in position 2 (✓ from FOLLY).
- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, E, R, I, F, Y (all received × so far).
- D is in the word but not in position 1 (from DRILL: D -).

Positions known so far:
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- Position 4: L (fixed).

Word skeleton so far: _ O _ L _

We still need one more L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Combining with the fact that D must appear (and not at position 1), the only remaining slots for D are 3 or 5.

So possibilities:
1. L O D L _   → word must end with a letter that’s still allowed (not forbidden) and no repeats.
2. _ O L L D   → but that would put L twice in positions 3,4 which is fine, but we’d need to check if D fits.
3. D O L L _   → but D was not allowed in position 1 (DRILL feedback: D -), so this is okay only if D is allowed in position 1, which it is (DRILL had D in 1 with “-”, meaning D is in the word but not in position 1). So D can’t be in position 1.

Thus the viable forms are:
- _ O _ L D (with another L somewhere)
- _ O L L D (but then we have three Ls, unlikely)
- _ O D L L (but then we have three Ls, unlikely)

Wait, we need exactly two Ls total. So:
- L O D L _ → but slot 5 would need to be a new letter, and we’d have two Ls (positions 1 and 4), O at 2, D at 3, and slot 5 could be any unused letter (but we’ve used D, O, L, and forbidden letters are S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y).
  Allowed remaining letters: B, C, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

But L O D L _ isn’t a valid word. Let’s think of actual words:
- Looking for _ O _ L _ with two Ls total, O at 2, L at 4, and another L at 1, 3, or 5, plus D somewhere.

The word must include D and not have it at position 1. So D must be at 3 or 5.

Case 1: D at 3 → pattern: _ O D L _
   Then the other L must be at 1 or 5. So:
   - L O D L _ → LODL_ - not a word.
   - _ O D L L → _ O D L L - possible words: “nodll” (no), “godll” (no), etc. Doesn’t seem valid.

Case 2: D at 5 → pattern: _ O _ L D
   Then the other L must be at 1 or 3.
   - L O _ L D → L O _ L D - possible: “lolly” but Y is forbidden.
   - _ O L L D → _ O L L D - possible words: “molly” but Y is forbidden, “golld” (no), “dolly” but D is at 1 and can’t be there.
   - “dolly” is invalid (D at 1 is forbidden, Y is forbidden).
   - “lolly” invalid (Y forbidden).
   - “holly” invalid (Y forbidden).

Hmm, maybe D is not at 3 or 5 but the initial feedback was D is in the word but not at 1. So D could be at 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, position 4 is L, so D must be at 3 or 5.

But we’re stuck finding words. Maybe I missed something.

Alternative approach: since O is at 2 and L at 4, and we have two Ls, the other L must be at 1, 3, or 5. Let’s list possible words:
- L O _ L _ : Need a letter at 3 that’s allowed (not forbidden) and a letter at 5 that’s allowed, plus include D somewhere.
  - L O W L Y → Y forbidden.
  - L O N L Y → Y forbidden.
  - L O G L D → not a word.
  - L O B L D → not a word.

- _ O L L _ : _ O L L _ with D somewhere, but D must be at 5 (since 1 is open, 2 O, 3 L, 4 L).
  - _ O L L D → “wolld” (no), “golld” (no), “polld” (no), “dolld” (invalid D at 1), etc.

- _ O _ L L : _ O _ L L with D at 3.
  - _ O D L L → “nodll” (no), “godll” (no), “podll” (no), etc.

This is tricky. Maybe the word is “dolly” but D at 1 is disallowed and Y is disallowed. 

Wait, perhaps the word has only one L but the feedback was misinterpreted. Re-reading:
DRILL → D(-) R(x) I(x) L(✓) L(-)
This means:
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- The second L is also in the word but in wrong position (-). So total two Ls: one at 4 and one elsewhere.

But in FOLLY → F(x) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(x)
- L at 4 is ✓ (already known)
- L at 5 is (-), meaning it’s in the word but not at 5. But position 5 is Y and L is at 5, so this implies L is not at 5, so the second L must be at 1 or 3.

Thus, positions:
- 2: O
- 4: L
- second L must be at 1 or 3.

Also, D is in the word (from DRILL: D -), and not at position 1. So D must be at 3 or 5. But 5 is Y (forbidden), so D at 3.

Thus the word must be:
- L O D L _ → but then 5th letter is needed, and we have O,D,L,L already, and no repeats. But we have two Ls already, so 5th must be new letter from allowed set.
  - L O D L _ → no valid word.

- _ O D L _ → but then where is the second L? It must be at 1 or 5. If at 5: _ O D L L → like “nodll” (no), “godll” (no), “podll” (no).

This seems impossible. Maybe the word has D at 3 and the second L at 1:
- L O D L _ → no valid word.

I’m stuck. Let me rethink: perhaps the word has only one L but I misread DRILL. Re-examining:
DRILL → D(-) R(x) I(x) L(✓) L(-)
The second L (-) means it’s in the word but not in position 5, but position 5 is L, so this implies L is in the word but not at 5, which is already satisfied by L at 4. So perhaps only one L is in the word, and the feedback is saying the L at 5 is not in the word (x), but the feedback shows L(-) for position 5, which is confusing. Wait, no, the feedback is per position:

DRILL:
- D at 1: (-) in word but not here
- R at 2: (x) not in word
- I at 3: (x) not in word
- L at 4: (✓) correct position
- L at 5: (-) in word but not here

This means the word has L in position 4 and L somewhere else (not at 5), so positions 1,2, or 3. But position 2 is O (from FOLLY: O(✓)), so second L must be at 1 or 3.

Also, D is in the word (from DRILL: D(-)), and not at 1, so D at 2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O, 4 is L, so D at 3 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. L O D L _ → but 5th letter must be new allowed letter, no valid word.
2. _ O D L _ → but second L must be at 1 or 3. If at 1: L O D L _ → no valid word.
3. _ O _ L D → but second L must be at 1 or 3. If at 1: L O _ L D → no valid word. If at 3: _ O L L D → “dolly” but D at 1 is invalid and Y is invalid.

This seems impossible with current constraints. Maybe the word is “dolly” despite Y being marked x in FOLLY, but Y(x) means Y is not in the word at all.

I must have missed a word. Let me list possible words with:
- O at 2
- L at 4
- second L at 1 or 3
- D at 3 or 5
- no S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y

Words:
- L O D L _ → no 5-letter word ends like this.
- _ O D L L → need first letter: available letters B,C,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,U,V,W,Z.
  - N O D L L → “nodll” (no)
  - G O D L L → “godll” (no)
  - M O D L L → “modll” (no)

- _ O L L D → need first letter from allowed set:
  - B O L L D → “bolld” (no)
  - C O L L D → “colld” (no)
  - G O L L D → “golld” (no)
  - H O L L D → “holld” (no)
  - J O L L D → “jolld” (no)
  - K O L L D → “kolld” (no)
  - M O L L D → “molld” (no)
  - N O L L D → “nolld” (no)
  - P O L L D → “polld” (no)
  - U O L L D → “uolld” (no)
  - V O L L D → “volld” (no)
  - W O L L D → “wolld” (no)
  - Z O L L D → “zolld” (no)

This seems impossible. Perhaps I misread the feedback. Re-examining FOLLY feedback:
F(x) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(x)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L at 4 is (✓) correct
- L at 5 is (-) in word but not here, but position 5 is Y, so L is not at 5, which is already known. So this implies only one L at 4, contradicting DRILL.

Wait, the feedback labels are per position:
- F at 1: x (not in word)
- O at 2: ✓ (correct position)
- L at 3: - (in word but not here)
- L at 4: ✓ (correct position)
- Y at 5: x (not in word)

This is conflicting: L at 3 is (-) meaning it’s in the word but not at 3, and L at 4 is (✓), implying L is at 4 and also elsewhere. So two Ls: one at 4 and one at 1 or 5 (since 2 is O, 3 is not L).

But Y at 5 is x, so L cannot be at 5, thus second L must be at 1.

Thus word must be L O _ L _ with D at 3 or 5, but 5 must be new allowed letter.

Possible words:
- L O W L _ → no valid word.
- L O N L _ → “lonli” (no), “lonle” (E forbidden)
- L O G L _ → “logli” (no)
- L O B L _ → “lobli” (no)
- L O M L _ → “lomli” (no)
- L O K L _ → “lokli” (no)
- L O P L _ → “lopli” (no)
- L O U L _ → “louli” (no)
- L O V L _ → “lovli” (no)
- L O C L _ → “locli” (no)
- L O H L _ → “lohli” (no)
- L O J L _ → “lojli” (no)
- L O N L D → “lonld” (no)

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that the word is “lolly” but Y is forbidden. 

Realizing I must have made an error: perhaps the word has only one L, and the DRILL feedback L(-) at position 5 was a misread. Actually, DRILL:
- L at 4: ✓
- L at 5: - (in word but not at 5), but since L is already at 4, this implies another L not at 5, so two Ls.

But with FOLLY showing L at 3 (-) and L at 4 (✓), this is contradictory because L can’t be both at 3 (but not) and at 4 (correct). The feedback must be per position, not per letter.

Rechecking feedback format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Thus for DRILL:
- D: (-) in word but not at 1
- R: (x) not in word
- I: (x) not in word
- L: (✓) correct at 4
- L: (-) in word but not at 5

This implies:
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- L is also in the word but not at 5, so second L must be at 1, 2, or 3.
- D is in the word but not at 1 (from DRILL D(-))

From FOLLY:
- F: x
- O: ✓ at 2
- L: - at 3 (in word but not at 3)
- L: ✓ at 4
- Y: x

Thus:
- O is at 2 (✓)
- L is at 4 (✓)
- L is also in word but not at 3, so second L must be at 1 or 5 (but 5 is Y(x), so second L at 1)
- D is in word but not at 1 (from DRILL), so D must be at 3 or 5. 5 is Y(x), so D at 3.

Thus word is L O D L _ but we need a 5th letter, but we already have L,O,D,L and no repeats, but the word must be 5 letters with these letters. This seems impossible because we have L,O,D,L and need one more letter, but the word must be exactly these letters arranged as L O D L ? which isn’t possible.

Realizing the word must be exactly five letters with these constraints:
- Letters: L (twice), O, D, and one more distinct letter
- Positions: L at 1 and 4, O at 2, D at 3 → L O D L _ → but 5th letter must be new, making it 6 letters.

This indicates no valid word under these constraints, meaning my earlier deductions must be flawed. The only resolution is that the word has only one L, and the DRILL feedback L(-) at position 5 was indicating that L is not at 5 (but already at 4), so only one L. Similarly, FOLLY L at 3 (-) just confirms L is not at 3, consistent with single L at 4.

Thus revised:
- One L at position 4
- O at position 2
- D in word but not at 1, so D at 3 or 5
- Forbidden letters: S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y
- Remaining letters: B,C,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,U,V,W,Z

Possible patterns:
- _ O D L _ : need 1st and 5th letters from allowed set
  - Words: “nodle” (E forbidden), “gondl” (no), “moldy” (Y forbidden), etc.
- _ O _ L D : need 1st and 3rd letters
  - Words: “bongo” (no), “hondo” (no), “moldy” (Y forbidden), “could” (U is allowed, C,O,U,L,D)
    - “could”: contains C,O,U,L,D
      - letters are allowed: C,O,U,L,D
      - positions:
        - C at 1: no info yet
        - O at 2: matches (✓ from FOLLY)
        - U at 3: new
        - L at 4: ✓
        - D at 5: could be, since D must be in word and not at 1
      - Check forbidden letters: S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y - none present
      - Valid word.

Thus the word is likely COULD.

But wait, we have:
- must have L at 4 (✓)
- must have O at 2 (✓ from FOLLY)
- must have D somewhere (from DRILL: D(-)), and not at 1, so COULD has D at 5, allowed.

Also, COULD has C, O, U, L, D - all letters not forbidden except for U which was never tested. This seems valid.

We still need one more L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Combining with the fact that D must appear (and not at position 1), the only remaining slots for D are 3 or 5.

So possibilities:
1. L O D L _   → word must end with a letter that’s still allowed (not forbidden) and no repeats.

  - N O D L L → “nodll” (no)
  - G O D L L → “godll” (no)
  - M O D L L → “modll” (no)

- _ O L L D → need first letter from allowed set:
  - B O L L D → “bolld” (no)
  - C O L L D → “colld” (no)
  - G O L L D → “golld” (no)
  - H O L L D → “holld” (no)
  - J O L L D → “jolld” (no)
  - K O L L D → “kolld” (no)
  - M O L L D → “molld” (no)
  - N O L L D → “nolld” (no)
  - P O L L D → “polld” (no)
  - U O L L D → “uolld” (no)
  - V O L L D → “volld” (no)
  - W O L L D → “wolld” (no)
  - Z O L L D → “zolld” (no)

This seems impossible. Perhaps I misread the feedback. Re-examining FOLLY feedback:
F(x) O(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(x)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L at 4 is (✓) correct
- L at 5 is (-) in word but not here, but position 5 is Y, so L is not at 5, which is already known. So this implies only one L at 4, contradicting DRILL.

Wait, the feedback labels are per position:
- F at 1: x (not in word)
- O at 2: ✓ (correct position)
- L at 3: - (in word but not here)
- L at 4: ✓ (correct position)
- Y at 5: x (not in word)

This is conflicting: L at 3 is (-) meaning it’s in the word but not at 3, and L at 4 is (✓), implying L is at 4 and also elsewhere. So two Ls: one at 4 and one at 1 or 5 (since 2 is O, 3 is not L).

But Y at 5 is x, so L cannot be at 5, thus second L must be at 1.

Thus word must be L O _ L _ with D at 3 or 5, but 5 must be new allowed letter.

Possible words:
- L O W L _ → no valid word.
- L O N L _ → “lonli” (no), “lonle” (E forbidden)
- L O G L _ → “logli” (no)
- L O B L _ → “lobli” (no)
- L O M L _ → “lomli” (no)
- L O K L _ → “lokli” (no)
- L O P L _ → “lopli” (no)
- L O U L _ → “louli” (no)
- L O V L _ → “lovli” (no)
- L O C L _ → “locli” (no)
- L O H L _ → “lohli” (no)
- L O J L _ → “lojli” (no)
- L O N L D → “lonld” (no)

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that the word is “lolly” but Y is forbidden. 

Realizing I must have made an error: perhaps the word has only one L, and the DRILL feedback L(-) at position 5 was a misread. Actually, DRILL:
- L at 4: ✓
- L at 5: - (in word but not at 5), but since L is already at 4, this implies another L not at 5, so two Ls.

But with FOLLY showing L at 3 (-) and L at 4 (✓), this is contradictory because L can’t be both at 3 (but not) and at 4 (correct). The feedback must be per position, not per letter.

Rechecking feedback format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Thus for DRILL:
- D: (-) in word but not at 1
- R: (x) not in word
- I: (x) not in word
- L: (✓) correct at 4
- L: (-) in word but not at 5

This implies:
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- L is also in the word but not at 5, so second L must be at 1, 2, or 3.
- D is in the word but not at 1 (from DRILL D(-))

From FOLLY:
- F: x
- O: ✓ at 2
- L: - at 3 (in word but not at 3)
- L: ✓ at 4
- Y: x

Thus:
- O is at 2 (✓)
- L is at 4 (✓)
- L is also in word but not at 3, so second L must be at 1 or 5 (but 5 is Y(x), so second L at 1)
- D is in word but not at 1 (from DRILL), so D must be at 3 or 5. 5 is Y(x), so D at 3.

Thus word is L O D L _ but we need a 5th letter, but we already have L,O,D,L and no repeats, but the word must be 5 letters with these letters. This seems impossible because we have L,O,D,L and need one more letter, but the word must be exactly these letters arranged as L O D L ? which isn’t possible.

Realizing the word must be exactly five letters with these constraints:
- Letters: L (twice), O, D, and one more distinct letter
- Positions: L at 1 and 4, O at 2, D at 3 → L O D L _ → but 5th letter must be new, making it 6 letters.

This indicates no valid word under these constraints, meaning my earlier deductions must be flawed. The only resolution is that the word has only one L, and the DRILL feedback L(-) at position 5 was indicating that L is not at 5 (but already at 4), so only one L. Similarly, FOLLY L at 3 (-) just confirms L is not at 3, consistent with single L at 4.

Thus revised:
- One L at position 4
- O at position 2
- D in word but not at 1, so D at 3 or 5
- Forbidden letters: S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y
- Remaining letters: B,C,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,U,V,W,Z

Possible patterns:
- _ O D L _ : need 1st and 5th letters from allowed set
  - Words: “nodle” (E forbidden), “gondl” (no), “moldy” (Y forbidden), etc.
- _ O _ L D : need 1st and 3rd letters
  - Words: “bongo” (no), “hondo” (no), “moldy” (Y forbidden), “could” (U is allowed, C,O,U,L,D)
    - “could”: contains C,O,U,L,D
      - letters are allowed: C,O,U,L,D
      - positions:
        - C at 1: no info yet
        - O at 2: matches (✓ from FOLLY)
        - U at 3: new
        - L at 4: ✓
        - D at 5: could be, since D must be in word and not at 1
      - Check forbidden letters: S,A,T,E,R,I,F,Y - none present
      - Valid word.

Thus the word is likely COULD.

But wait, we have:
- must have L at 4 (✓)
- must have O at 2 (✓ from FOLLY)
- must have D somewhere (from DRILL: D(-)), and not at 1, so COULD has D at 5, allowed.

Also, COULD has C, O, U, L, D - all letters not forbidden except for U which was never tested. This seems valid.

<guess>COULD</guess>",Guess 4: COULD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
