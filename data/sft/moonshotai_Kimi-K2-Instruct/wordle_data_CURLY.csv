For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. It's strategic to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are good starting points because they use common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- The letter combination is diverse enough to give good feedback on multiple potential letters

This should provide valuable information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 2nd letter).

So the mystery word:
- Contains the letter R somewhere other than the 2nd spot.
- Does not contain A, O, S, E.
- Must still have 5 distinct letters.

Since we know R is somewhere, I’ll pick a word that:
- Places R in a different position (let’s try 3rd for now).
- Uses other common letters that weren’t ruled out (T, I, N, L, U, etc.).
- Avoids A, O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRIUM”:
- T is common and wasn’t tested.
- R is moved to the 3rd position (was 2nd before).
- I and U are common vowels not ruled out.
- M is another common consonant.

However, “TRIUM” isn’t a valid 5-letter English word. Instead, I’ll use “TRUNK”:
- T, U, N, K are all new letters.

So far we know:
1. A, O, S, E, T, N, K are NOT in the word.
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
3. U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. We still need 3 more distinct letters (since R and U are already confirmed and their positions are restricted).

Therefore the word:
- Contains R and U.
- R cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- U cannot be in position 4.
- The other 3 letters must come from the remaining alphabet excluding: A, O, S, E, T, N, K.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good strategy is to test new common consonants and a vowel or two. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, let’s include I (the next most common vowel after A, O, E which are ruled out).

Let’s try a word that:
- Places R in position 1 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
- Places U somewhere not 4.
- Adds two common consonants and the vowel I.

A good candidate is “FRUIT”:
- F, I are new letters.
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- U in position 3 (allowed).
- T is already ruled out, so that won’t work.

Alternative: “BRICK” – B, I, C, K. But K is ruled out.

Next idea: “DRUID”:
- D and I are new.
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2 from Guess 1). So no.

Another option: “CRUMB”:
- C, M, B are new.
- U is in position 3 (allowed).
- R in position 2 (not allowed).

Let’s try “CURVY”:
- C, V, Y are new.
- U in position 2 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (not allowed).

Next: “FURRY” – but R might be twice (we don’t know yet) and Y is acceptable but double R is risky.

Another approach: since R is in the word and must be in position 1, 4, or 5, let’s try R in position 1 and U in position 2.

Possible word: “RUMBA” – but A is ruled out.

“RUMPY” – P and Y are new, U in 2, R in 1, M is new. Let’s check:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- U in 2 (allowed).
- M, P, Y are new.
This seems valid.

But is “RUMPY” a valid English word? Yes, it’s an informal word meaning “grumpy”.

- R in position 3 (not allowed).

Next: “FURRY” – but R might be twice (we don’t know yet) and Y is acceptable but double R is risky.

Another approach: since R is in the word and must be in position 1, 4, or 5, let’s try R in position 1 and U in position 2.

Possible word: “RUMBA” – but A is ruled out.

“RUMPY” – P and Y are new, U in 2, R in 1, M is new. Let’s check:
- R in 1 (allowed).
- U in 2 (allowed).
- M, P, Y are new.
This seems valid.

But is “RUMPY” a valid English word? Yes, it’s an informal word meaning “grumpy”.

Another valid word: “RUDDY” – but D and Y are new, U in 2, R in 1.

Between these, “RUMPY” and “RUDDY”, I’ll go with “RUDDY” as it’s more common.

From the new feedback:

1. R is still in the wrong position (it can’t be 1, 2, or 3).
2. U is now confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).
3. D and D are NOT in the word (x).
4. Y is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓).

So far the mystery word has the structure:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: Y

And it definitely contains the letter R, but R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore R must be in position 4.

So we now have:
- U in position 2, Y in position 5, R in position 4.
- Positions 1 and 3 are still unknown.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, T, N, K, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Z.

Remaining vowels: I (only common one left).

So positions 1 and 3 must be filled from the allowed letters. Let’s try a word that:
- Has U in 2, R in 4, Y in 5.
- Adds two new common consonants or the vowel I.

Possible structure: ? U ? R Y.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that fit this pattern. One example is “BURGY”:
- B and G are new.
- U in 2, R in 4, Y in 5.

Another is “PURFY”:
- P and F are new.
- U in 2, R in 4, Y in 5.

But “PURFY” is a rare variant of “purify”. A better common word is “CURLY”:
- C and L are new.
- U in 2, R in 4, Y in 5.

“CURLY” is a perfectly valid English word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, I will guess CURLY.
