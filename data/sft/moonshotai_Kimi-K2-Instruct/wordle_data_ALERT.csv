### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For a first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in English 5-letter words
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat letters (to maximize information gain)
4. Uses letters that appear frequently in English words

Some good starting words are ADIEU, SLATE, CRANE, or RAISE. These all contain very common letters. I'll go with RAISE because:
- R is very common
- A is the most common vowel
- I and S are also very common
- E is the most common letter in English
- This gives me 5 unique common letters to test

This should give good information about what letters might be in the secret word.

Round 1 – RAISE  
R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)

→ I and S are not in the word.

Round 2 – TREAD  
T(-) R(-) E(✓) A(-) D(x)  
→ E is now confirmed in the correct position (3rd).  
→ T and R are in the word but wrong positions (T≠1, R≠2).  
→ A is still in the word but not in positions 2, 4 (from Round 1 and 2).  
→ D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters to include: R, A, E (E fixed at position 3)  
- Letters to exclude: I, S, D  
- Positions ruled out:
  – R cannot be 1 or 2  
  – A cannot be 2 or 4  
  – T cannot be 1 but is in word

Available positions for R: 3,4,5 (but 3 is E) → 4 or 5  
Available positions for A: 1,3,5 (3 is E) → 1 or 5  
T can be placed almost anywhere (only not 1).

Let’s choose a word that:
- Puts E in slot 3 (already fixed).  
- Moves R to 4 or 5.  
- Moves A to 1 or 5 (not 2,3,4).  
- Adds new common letters (L, N, etc.).

A candidate: WATER  
- W (new), A, T, E (fixed), R  
Positions: A(2) – but A can’t be 2 (from Round 1). Discard.

Next candidate: EARTH  
- E is already fixed at 3, so E at 1 fails. Discard.

Next candidate: CRATE  
- C, R, A, T, E  
Positions: R(2) – but R can’t be 2. Discard.

Next candidate: LATER  
- L, A, T, E, R  
Positions:  
  L(1) new  
  A(2) – but A can’t be 2. Discard.

Next candidate: RATEL

  – A at 1 is allowed (only barred from 2,4).  
  – R at 4 is allowed (barred from 1,2).
