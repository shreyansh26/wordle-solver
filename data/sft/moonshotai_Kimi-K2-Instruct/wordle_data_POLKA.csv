For the first guess, there's no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Choosing a word that uses these letters efficiently is key. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it uses five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E), covering vowels and common consonants. This should provide good feedback on multiple letters at once.

- VOILA - V allowed, I,L,A allowed, A in position 5

""VOILA"" seems good - uses new letters V,I,L and has A in position 5.

Wait, but does ""VOILA"" have O in position 2? V O I L A - yes, O is position 2. And A is position 5 which is allowed. And no banned letters.

But is VOILA a valid 5-letter English word? It's a variant spelling of ""voilà"" but might be accepted in Wordle-type games.

Alternatively, ""GONAL"" - but G,O,N,A,L - but is this a valid word? Not common.

""BOGAN"" - B,O,G,A,N - but is this a recognized word?

""MOLAR"" - R banned.

""FOCAL"" - F,O,C,A,L - yes, this seems better. F,O,C,A,L - O in position 2, A in position 4, and uses new letters F,C,L.

Yes, FOCAL is a common word that fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does not contain R, S, or E.
- Contains A somewhere except position 1.
- Contains O somewhere except position 3.

Common 5-letter words with A and O, avoiding R/S/E and keeping in mind their possible positions (A≠1, O≠3):
We also want to test new common letters (T, N, L, I, U, etc.).

A good candidate is 'ATOLL':
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 - but feedback said O is not in position 3. So ATOLL is invalid.

Next try 'ABOUT':
- A is in position 1 - but feedback says A is not in position 1. Invalid.

Next try 'ADORN' - but contains R. Invalid.

Try 'ADOPT':
- A in position 1 - invalid.

Try 'ALOUD':

Current confirmed information:

- Word pattern: _ O _ _ A   (O locked in position 2, A locked in position 5)
- Letters ruled out so far:
  A (in wrong positions), R, S, E, T, D, Y, F, C, V, I
- Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z
- Also know:
  – L appeared in position 4 once with “-”, so L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So positions look like: _ O _ _ A
And L must be in position 3.

Therefore the word must be: _ O L _ A

Now we just need a consonant for position 1 and 4 such that remaining letters haven’t been banned.

Possible letters for position 1 & 4: B, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (avoiding duplicates for now)

Common English 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
- BOLLA – but ends with double L; also L already in position 3.
- GOLIA – not recognized
- HOLLA – slang
- JOLLA – rare
- MOLLA – not common
- POLKA – K allowed, P allowed, ends with A fits, but K is in position 4 and we know letters allowed.

POLKA fits perfectly:
P (position 1) – allowed
O (position 2) – locked
L (position 3) – must be here
K (position 4) – allowed
A (position 5) – locked

No banned letters used.
