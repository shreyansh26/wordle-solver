Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that will give me the most useful information across common letters. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters to maximize chances of getting hits
2. Cover different letters to quickly eliminate possibilities
3. Preferably include vowels since most 5-letter words have them

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ADIEU"", ""SOARE"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A, T, E are extremely common letters
- It covers 5 distinct letters with no repeats

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓) → word starts with S
- T is in the word but wrong position (-) → T is somewhere after position 1, not at position 4
- L, A, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ T _ or S _ T _ _ (T could be in positions 3 or 5, but not 4, since it was marked wrong-position at 4)

I need a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Uses letters we know are not excluded (so no L, A, E)
3. Includes T somewhere in positions 3 or 5
4. Uses new common letters to test others

Good candidate words following this pattern:
- STUMP (S T _ _ T but repeats T, not allowed)
- SIGHT (S I G H T) - uses T at end, tests I,G,H which are common
- SWIFT (S W I F T) - uses T at end, tests W,I,F
- SPORT (S P O R T) - uses T at end, tests P,O,R

Among these, ""SPORT"" seems best because:
- P,O,R are all very common letters
- Tests 4 new letters with one guess
- Follows the S _ _ _ T pattern

However, T was marked wrong at position 4 in SLATE, so in SPORT it would be at position 5 - which is allowed since we just know it's not at position 4.

Wait, the feedback shows T is in the word but wrong position, originally at position 4, so it could be positions 1-3 or 5. But position 1 is S, so possible positions 2,3, or 5.

Let me think of a word that puts T in position 2 or 3 or 5, starts with S, and uses new common letters.

""STONY"" would have T at position 2, but uses O,N,Y
""SHIRT"" would have T at position 5, tests H,I,R
""SHOOT"" has double O which is less ideal
""SUITE"" has E which we know is out
""STINT"" has T at 2 and 5 but repeats T
""STORK"" is good - S T O R K, puts T at position 2, tests O,R,K

I think ""STORK"" is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters to maximize chances of getting hits
2. Cover different letters to quickly eliminate possibilities
3. Preferably include vowels since most 5-letter words have them

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ADIEU"", ""SOARE"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A, T, E are extremely common letters
- It covers 5 distinct letters with no repeats

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓) → word starts with S
- T is in the word but wrong position (-) → T is somewhere after position 1, not at position 4
- L, A, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ T _ or S _ T _ _ (T could be in positions 3 or 5, but not 4, since it was marked wrong-position at 4)

I need a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Uses letters we know are not excluded (so no L, A, E)
3. Includes T somewhere in positions 3 or 5
4. Uses new common letters to test others

Good candidate words following this pattern:
- STUMP (S T _ _ T but repeats T, not allowed)
- SIGHT (S I G H T) - uses T at end, tests I,G,H which are common
- SWIFT (S W I F T) - uses T at end, tests W,I,F
- SPORT (S P O R T) - uses T at end, tests P,O,R

Among these, ""SPORT"" seems best because:
- P,O,R are all very common letters
- Tests 4 new letters with one guess
- Follows the S _ _ _ T pattern

However, T was marked wrong at position 4 in SLATE, so in SPORT it would be at position 5 - which is allowed since we just know it's not at position 4.

Wait, the feedback shows T is in the word but wrong position, originally at position 4, so it could be positions 1-3 or 5. But position 1 is S, so possible positions 2,3, or 5.

Let me think of a word that puts T in position 2 or 3 or 5, starts with S, and uses new common letters.

""STONY"" would have T at position 2, but uses O,N,Y
""SHIRT"" would have T at position 5, tests H,I,R
""SHOOT"" has double O which is less ideal
""SUITE"" has E which we know is out
""STINT"" has T at 2 and 5 but repeats T
""STORK"" is good - S T O R K, puts T at position 2, tests O,R,K

I think ""STORK"" is a strong next guess.
