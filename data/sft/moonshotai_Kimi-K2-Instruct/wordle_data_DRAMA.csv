For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A common starting word used in Wordle strategies is ""SLATE"" because it covers some of the most frequent letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"" which also uses common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels and two very common consonants, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
2. R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
3. O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So we need:
- A 5-letter word with R as the 2nd letter.
- The letter A must appear somewhere (but not 1st).
- No O, S, or E.

Good letters so far: R (fixed at 2nd), and A somewhere (not 1st). Bad letters: O, S, E.

Let's look for a word fitting this pattern. A common pattern is _ R A _ _ or _ R _ A _. 

Possible candidates: 
- BRAVO (but has O which is eliminated)
- CRANK (has no O, S, or E; A is 3rd; R is 2nd)
- GRANT (but has N and T which weren't tested yet)
- DRAIN (but has I and N which weren't tested yet)

""CRANK"" seems good - it has R in position 2, A in position 3, no O/S/E, and uses new letters to test.

So far we know:

- Pattern:  _ R A _ _   (R is 2nd, A is 3rd)
- Letters ruled out completely: C, O, S, E, N, K, G, I, L  
- Letter A must still appear somewhere else (because the A(-) in AROSE tells us A is in the word but NOT in 1st position, and we’ve only placed it in 3rd so far).  
  Therefore the other A must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining alphabet that has not been tried:  
B, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word matching:
- _ R A A _  or _ R A _ A

Common dictionary entries:
- BRAID – has I (eliminated)
- BRAWL – has W, L (L eliminated)
- TRAWL – has T, W, L (L eliminated)
- DRAMA – has D, M
- BRAVA – has V, ends in A
- FRANC – has N (eliminated)
- CRASH – has C, S (both eliminated)

DRAMA and BRAVA both fit the pattern and use only letters not yet eliminated.  
Let’s choose DRAMA because it places the second A in position 4, satisfying the requirement that A appear again somewhere other than position 1.
