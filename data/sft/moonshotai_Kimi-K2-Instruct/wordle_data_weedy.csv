Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a starting word that will give me the most information. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers 4 vowels and a common consonant)
- ALERT (common letters and structure)
- CRANE
- SLATE

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, C, I. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

Good remaining vowels not yet tried:  
None – only E is confirmed. (We’ve already ruled out A, O, I, U.)

So the word must contain E somewhere in positions 1–4 and only use letters not on the forbidden list.

Current confirmed facts:

1. E is in the word and is in position 2.  
   Word pattern now: _ E _ _ _

2. Letters known to be absent entirely:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K

3. Letters confirmed to appear somewhere (exact positions unknown so far):  
   Y — appears, but NOT in position 5 (because in PECKY it was placed at position 5 and received ✓, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4).

4. Still-allowed letters (have not been eliminated and have not been placed yet):  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z, plus E (already locked at 2) and Y (must appear once more in 1, 3 or 4).

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ E _ _ _ using only the allowed letters, with Y placed exactly once in 1, 3 or 4, and each other letter not repeating (unless the word happens to have a double letter, but we have no evidence for that).

A good high-information choice would:
- place Y in a new spot (1 or 4, since 3 is still open).  
- pick other still-allowed letters to fill the remaining blanks.

Let’s try B E W D Y:

- B: still allowed  
- E: locked at 2  
- W: still allowed  
- D: still allowed  
- Y: allowed and placed at 5 to test if Y is allowed elsewhere (but we already know Y is not in 5). Wait, that contradicts our earlier deduction.

Actually, the feedback for Y in PECKY was ✓, meaning it is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5). This is a key correction: if the feedback is ✓, it means that letter is both in the word AND in that exact spot.

Therefore:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from PECKY).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓ from PECKY).  
So the word is now: _ E _ _ Y

Confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K.

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with distinct letters from the allowed set.

A good high-information choice is to pick common remaining consonants. A common pattern is to try D, M, or H early.

Let’s try:  
Position 1: B  
Position 3: D  
Position 4: G  

So B E D G Y → BEDGY (not a valid English word).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,weedy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a starting word that will give me the most information. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers 4 vowels and a common consonant)
- ALERT (common letters and structure)
- CRANE
- SLATE

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, C, I. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first-guess feedback:
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
E(-) – E is in the word but in a different position (it was last, so it must be in spots 1-4).

So we now know:
- Letters to avoid forever: A, R, O, S
- Letter definitely present but not in position 5: E
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4
- None of the letters A, R, O, S can appear anywhere in the secret word.

A good second guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1-4).
2. Use other high-frequency letters that are still allowed (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).

A very common and informative second word is “UNTIL”:
- It has E at position 4 (moves it from 5 to 4).
- Uses U, N, T, I, L – none of which are the forbidden letters.
- All five letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>After two guesses we have eliminated a large set of letters:

Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L

Guaranteed letter:  
E (must be in the word, but cannot be in position 5)

Remaining positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good remaining common consonants not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Good remaining vowels not yet tried:  
None – only E is confirmed. (We’ve already ruled out A, O, I, U.)

So the word must contain E somewhere in positions 1–4 and only use letters not on the forbidden list.

A high-information third guess should:
- Place E in a still-allowed spot (positions 1–4).
- Use other frequent, still-allowed consonants.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

A balanced choice is “PECKY”:
- P, E, C, K, Y: none of these letters have been eliminated.
- E sits in position 2 (new placement).
- Includes both common consonants (P, C, K) and the less-common Y, giving good coverage.

Confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K.

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with distinct letters from the allowed set.

A good high-information choice is to pick common remaining consonants. A common pattern is to try D, M, or H early.

Let’s try:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,weedy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a starting word that will give me the most information. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words include:
- AROSE (covers 4 vowels and a common consonant)
- ALERT (common letters and structure)
- CRANE
- SLATE

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, C, I. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first-guess feedback:
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
E(-) – E is in the word but in a different position (it was last, so it must be in spots 1-4).

So we now know:
- Letters to avoid forever: A, R, O, S
- Letter definitely present but not in position 5: E
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4
- None of the letters A, R, O, S can appear anywhere in the secret word.

A good second guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1-4).
2. Use other high-frequency letters that are still allowed (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).

A very common and informative second word is “UNTIL”:
- It has E at position 4 (moves it from 5 to 4).
- Uses U, N, T, I, L – none of which are the forbidden letters.
- All five letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>After two guesses we have eliminated a large set of letters:

Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L

Guaranteed letter:  
E (must be in the word, but cannot be in position 5)

Remaining positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good remaining common consonants not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Good remaining vowels not yet tried:  
None – only E is confirmed. (We’ve already ruled out A, O, I, U.)

So the word must contain E somewhere in positions 1–4 and only use letters not on the forbidden list.

A high-information third guess should:
- Place E in a still-allowed spot (positions 1–4).
- Use other frequent, still-allowed consonants.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

A balanced choice is “PECKY”:
- P, E, C, K, Y: none of these letters have been eliminated.
- E sits in position 2 (new placement).
- Includes both common consonants (P, C, K) and the less-common Y, giving good coverage.

   Word pattern now: _ E _ _ _

2. Letters known to be absent entirely:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K

3. Letters confirmed to appear somewhere (exact positions unknown so far):  
   Y — appears, but NOT in position 5 (because in PECKY it was placed at position 5 and received ✓, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4).

4. Still-allowed letters (have not been eliminated and have not been placed yet):  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z, plus E (already locked at 2) and Y (must appear once more in 1, 3 or 4).

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ E _ _ _ using only the allowed letters, with Y placed exactly once in 1, 3 or 4, and each other letter not repeating (unless the word happens to have a double letter, but we have no evidence for that).

A good high-information choice would:
- place Y in a new spot (1 or 4, since 3 is still open).  
- pick other still-allowed letters to fill the remaining blanks.

Let’s try B E W D Y:

- B: still allowed  
- E: locked at 2  
- W: still allowed  
- D: still allowed  
- Y: allowed and placed at 5 to test if Y is allowed elsewhere (but we already know Y is not in 5). Wait, that contradicts our earlier deduction.

Actually, the feedback for Y in PECKY was ✓, meaning it is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5). This is a key correction: if the feedback is ✓, it means that letter is both in the word AND in that exact spot.

Therefore:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from PECKY).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓ from PECKY).  
So the word is now: _ E _ _ Y

Confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K.

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with distinct letters from the allowed set.

A good high-information choice is to pick common remaining consonants. A common pattern is to try D, M, or H early.

Let’s try:  
Position 1: B  
Position 3: D  
Position 4: G  

So B E D G Y → BEDGY (not a valid English word).  
Next try:  
B E D G Y → invalid.  
Try M E D G Y → invalid.  

Looking for valid English words with pattern _ E _ _ Y and letters from allowed set:

Valid candidates:  
- GEMMY (invalid: double M, and M not tried yet)  
- BEVVY (invalid letters)  
- MEWL is 4 letters  
- HEFTY → H, E, F, T, Y → T is eliminated  
- JEMMY → J, E, M, M, Y → valid word and all letters allowed so far (J, M not eliminated)  
- BEMIX → X allowed but I is eliminated  
- GEMMY → double M, but valid word

We want high information, so JEMMY provides J and M both untested.

Another valid candidate is BEMIX → but I is eliminated.

Another is HEXED → X and D allowed, but E is already placed at 2, and this would have E twice, which is possible but unlikely without evidence.

Best valid candidate: JEMMY (J, E, M, M, Y). Even though M is repeated, it’s a valid word and tests J and M. But double letters reduce information.

Another: F E M M Y → invalid.  
D E M M Y → invalid.

Best valid word: HEFTY → H, E, F, T, Y → but T is eliminated.  
Next: W E D G Y → WEDGY (valid slang/technical term, sometimes allowed).

Most likely valid: WEDGY (W, E, D, G, Y). All letters allowed.

Let’s choose WEDGY.

Still-allowed letters (have not been eliminated and have not been placed yet):  \n   B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z, plus E (already locked at 2) and Y (must appear once more in 1, 3 or 4).\n\nWe need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ E _ _ _ using only the allowed letters, with Y placed exactly once in 1, 3 or 4, and each other letter not repeating (unless the word happens to have a double letter, but we have no evidence for that).\n\nA good high-information choice would:\n- place Y in a new spot (1 or 4, since 3 is still open).  \n- pick other still-allowed letters to fill the remaining blanks.\n\nLet’s try B E W D Y:\n\n- B: still allowed  \n- E: locked at 2  \n- W: still allowed  \n- D: still allowed  \n- Y: allowed and placed at 5 to test if Y is allowed elsewhere (but we already know Y is not in 5). Wait, that contradicts our earlier deduction.\n\nActually, the feedback for Y in PECKY was ✓, meaning it is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5). This is a key correction: if the feedback is ✓, it means that letter is both in the word AND in that exact spot.\n\nTherefore:\n- E is in position 2 (✓ from PECKY).  \n- Y is in position 5 (✓ from PECKY).  \nSo the word is now: _ E _ _ Y\n\nConfirmed absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, L, P, C, K.\n\nAllowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with distinct letters from the allowed set.\n\nA good high-information choice is to pick common remaining consonants. A common pattern is to try D, M, or H early.\n\nLet’s try:  \nPosition 1: B  \nPosition 3: D  \nPosition 4: G  \n\nSo B E D G Y → BEDGY (not a valid English word).  \nNext try:  \nB E D G Y → invalid.  \nTry M E D G Y → invalid.  \n\nLooking for valid English words with pattern _ E _ _ Y and letters from allowed set:\n\nValid candidates:  \n- GEMMY (invalid: double M, and M not tried yet)  \n- BEVVY (invalid letters)  \n- MEWL is 4 letters  \n- HEFTY → H, E, F, T, Y → T is eliminated  \n- JEMMY → J, E, M, M, Y → valid word and all letters allowed so far (J, M not eliminated)  \n- BEMIX → X allowed but I is eliminated  \n- GEMMY → double M, but valid word\n\nWe want high information, so JEMMY provides J and M both untested.\n\nAnother valid candidate is BEMIX → but I is eliminated.\n\nAnother is HEXED → X and D allowed, but E is already placed at 2, and this would have E twice, which is possible but unlikely without evidence.\n\nBest valid candidate: JEMMY (J, E, M, M, Y). Even though M is repeated, it’s a valid word and tests J and M. But double letters reduce information.\n\nAnother: F E M M Y → invalid.  \nD E M M Y → invalid.\n\nBest valid word: HEFTY → H, E, F, T, Y → but T is eliminated.  \nNext: W E D G Y → WEDGY (valid slang/technical term, sometimes allowed).\n\nMost likely valid: WEDGY (W, E, D, G, Y). All letters allowed.\n\nLet’s choose WEDGY.\n\nPattern: W E D G Y  \nCheck letters: W, E (pos 2 ✓), D, G, Y (pos 5 ✓).

From Guess 5 we learned:

- The feedback for WEDDY was:  
  W(✓) E(✓) D(-) D(✓) Y(✓)

- Breaking this down:
  – W(✓)  → W is correct in position 1 (already known).  
  – E(✓)  → E is correct in position 2 (already known).  
  – D(-)  → the first D (position 3) is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  – D(✓)  → the second D (position 4) **is in the correct position 4**.  
  – Y(✓)  → Y is correct in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now:
W E _ D Y

And we also know:
- The letter that goes in position 3 must be **D**, because the D(-) in position 3 and D(✓) in position 4 together tell us both D’s exist in the word, and the only place left for the first D is position 3.

Therefore the **only** word that satisfies all these constraints is **W E D D Y**.

Since this is a valid English word and fits every piece of feedback, it must be the secret word.
