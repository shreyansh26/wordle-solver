This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to guide me. My best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it includes all five common vowels (A, E, O) and two frequently used consonants (R, S). This should help me identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, even if their positions aren't correct.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y
2. Letters confirmed in the word but in the wrong place: U (-) and I (-)

So the secret word contains both U and I, but:
- U is present but not in position 1
- I is present but not in position 3

Remaining high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, C, H, G, M, P, B, F, K  
We also still have the vowels I and U available (and not yet eliminated).

We need a five-letter word that uses:
- Only letters not eliminated
- Contains both U and I
- U is not in position 1, I is not in position 3

Candidate words fitting these rules:
- BUILD (uses B, U, I, L, D – none are ruled out)
- CUBIC (but C would appear twice and we don’t know about duplicates yet)
- FLUID (F, L, U, I, D – all letters remain possible)
- BLIMP (doesn’t contain U or I – irrelevant)

Between BUILD and FLUID, BUILD has slightly more common letter set (B, U, I, L, D).

I’ll choose BUILD.

From the feedback so far:

- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, B, D
- Confirmed letters and their states:
  - U is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in BUILD).
  - I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since in UNITY it was '-', and in BUILD it's also '-').
  - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it's '-' in BUILD).

So the word has the form: _ U _ _ _ with:
- I must appear in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3)
- L must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 4)

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones). From these, common letters are C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W.

We need a 5-letter word where:
- Position 2 is U
- Contains I and L in valid positions
- Uses only remaining possible letters

Possible structures:
- If I is in position 1: I U L _ _ or I U _ L _ etc. but L can't be in 4 (already known)
- If I is in position 4: _ U _ I _
- If I is in position 5: _ U _ _ I

Let's explore _ U _ I _:
Then L must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Position 5 is I, so L must be 1 or 3:
- L U _ I _ → need a word like L U C I _ or L U F I _ etc.
- _ U L I _ → need a word like C U L I _ or F U L I _ etc.

Looking for common words:
- ""HUMID"": H (valid), U (position 2), M (valid), I (position 4), D (eliminated) → can't use
- ""LUCID"": L (position 1), U (2), C (3), I (4), D (5) → D is eliminated
- ""FUSIL"": F (valid), U (2), S (eliminated), I (4), L (5) → S is eliminated
- ""CULIC"": Not a word
- ""PULIK"": P (valid), U (2), L (3), I (4), K (5) → ""PULIK"" is a valid word (a type of Hungarian herding dog)

""PULIK"" seems valid and fits all constraints:
- P, U, L, I, K are all not eliminated
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (not in 3, which is okay)
- L is in position 3 (not in 4, which is okay)

Alternative:
- ""LUPIN"": L (1), U (2), P (3), I (4), N (5) → N is eliminated
- ""LURID"": L (1), U (2), R (3), I (4), D (5) → R and D are eliminated

""PULIK"" appears to be the best fit.

- If I is in position 1: I U L _ _ or I U _ L _ etc. but L can't be in 4 (already known)
- If I is in position 4: _ U _ I _
- If I is in position 5: _ U _ _ I

Let's explore _ U _ I _:
Then L must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Position 5 is I, so L must be 1 or 3:
- L U _ I _ → need a word like L U C I _ or L U F I _ etc.
- _ U L I _ → need a word like C U L I _ or F U L I _ etc.

Looking for common words:
- ""HUMID"": H (valid), U (position 2), M (valid), I (position 4), D (eliminated) → can't use
- ""LUCID"": L (position 1), U (2), C (3), I (4), D (5) → D is eliminated
- ""FUSIL"": F (valid), U (2), S (eliminated), I (4), L (5) → S is eliminated
- ""CULIC"": Not a word
- ""PULIK"": P (valid), U (2), L (3), I (4), K (5) → ""PULIK"" is a valid word (a type of Hungarian herding dog)

""PULIK"" seems valid and fits all constraints:
- P, U, L, I, K are all not eliminated
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (not in 3, which is okay)
- L is in position 3 (not in 4, which is okay)

Alternative:
- ""LUPIN"": L (1), U (2), P (3), I (4), N (5) → N is eliminated
- ""LURID"": L (1), U (2), R (3), I (4), D (5) → R and D are eliminated

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,pupil,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

My best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it includes all five common vowels (A, E, O) and two frequently used consonants (R, S). This should help me identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, even if their positions aren't correct.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters we tried (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates 5 vowels plus two very common consonants.  
The remaining high-frequency letters that we haven’t used yet include T, N, I, L, U, C, Y.  
We still want a valid 5-letter word composed exclusively of letters not ruled out.  
A common word that uses five fresh, fairly frequent letters is “UNITY”.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y
2. Letters confirmed in the word but in the wrong place: U (-) and I (-)

So the secret word contains both U and I, but:
- U is present but not in position 1
- I is present but not in position 3

Remaining high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, C, H, G, M, P, B, F, K  
We also still have the vowels I and U available (and not yet eliminated).

We need a five-letter word that uses:
- Only letters not eliminated
- Contains both U and I
- U is not in position 1, I is not in position 3

Candidate words fitting these rules:
- BUILD (uses B, U, I, L, D – none are ruled out)
- CUBIC (but C would appear twice and we don’t know about duplicates yet)
- FLUID (F, L, U, I, D – all letters remain possible)
- BLIMP (doesn’t contain U or I – irrelevant)

Between BUILD and FLUID, BUILD has slightly more common letter set (B, U, I, L, D).

I’ll choose BUILD.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(-) L(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, B, D
- Confirmed letters and their states:
  - U is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in BUILD).
  - I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since in UNITY it was '-', and in BUILD it's also '-').
  - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it's '-' in BUILD).

So the word has the form: _ U _ _ _ with:
- I must appear in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3)
- L must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 4)

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones). From these, common letters are C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W.

We need a 5-letter word where:
- Position 2 is U
- Contains I and L in valid positions
- Uses only remaining possible letters

Possible structures:
- If I is in position 1: I U L _ _ or I U _ L _ etc. but L can't be in 4 (already known)
- If I is in position 4: _ U _ I _
- If I is in position 5: _ U _ _ I

Let's explore _ U _ I _:
Then L must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Position 5 is I, so L must be 1 or 3:
- L U _ I _ → need a word like L U C I _ or L U F I _ etc.
- _ U L I _ → need a word like C U L I _ or F U L I _ etc.

Looking for common words:
- ""HUMID"": H (valid), U (position 2), M (valid), I (position 4), D (eliminated) → can't use
- ""LUCID"": L (position 1), U (2), C (3), I (4), D (5) → D is eliminated
- ""FUSIL"": F (valid), U (2), S (eliminated), I (4), L (5) → S is eliminated
- ""CULIC"": Not a word
- ""PULIK"": P (valid), U (2), L (3), I (4), K (5) → ""PULIK"" is a valid word (a type of Hungarian herding dog)

""PULIK"" seems valid and fits all constraints:
- P, U, L, I, K are all not eliminated
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (not in 3, which is okay)
- L is in position 3 (not in 4, which is okay)

Alternative:
- ""LUPIN"": L (1), U (2), P (3), I (4), N (5) → N is eliminated
- ""LURID"": L (1), U (2), R (3), I (4), D (5) → R and D are eliminated

""PULIK"" appears to be the best fit.

From all feedback so far:

1. Eliminated letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, B, D, K
2. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1 = P  (✓ in PULIK)
   - Position 2 = U  (✓ in BUILD and PULIK)
   - Position 4 = I  (✓ in PULIK)
3. Remaining constraints:
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (from BUILD and PULIK feedback)
   - Therefore L must sit in position 5.
4. Unknown: position 3.  The only letters not yet tested that are still allowed and common enough are C, F, G, H, M, V, W.

So the secret word must be:

P  U  ?  I  L
1  2  3  4  5

Candidate letters for position 3: C, F, G, H, M, V, W

Real 5-letter English words fitting P U _ I L:
- P U C I L  → “PUPIL” (but P repeats, and we’re not sure about duplicates; also U already used twice in guesses, no rule against it, but let’s see other choices)
- P U F I L  → no common word
- P U G I L  → “PUGIL” (archaic / rare)
- P U H I L  → no word
- P U M I L  → “PUMIL” (not standard)
- P U V I L  → no word
- P U W I L  → no word

The only recognizable one is “PUPIL”, which reuses P and U (allowed), and keeps L in position 5 (allowed).

Check PUPIL against constraints:
- P(✓) U(✓) P(new) I(✓) L(valid position) — all rules satisfied.
