For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and their positions. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it covers:
- R (a common consonant)
- A (a common vowel)
- I (a common vowel)
- S (a very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in the secret word. It also places these letters in positions where they commonly appear, which might help identify correct positions more quickly.

I(x) – I is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

- Position 5 is E (✓ from both guesses)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (- from RAISE, - from CABLE)
- Letters already ruled out entirely: R, I, S, C, B, L
- Therefore remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common: T, N, M, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, F, Y and we still need to place A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- includes A but not in positions 2 or 3
- does NOT contain R,I,S,C,B,L

Good candidates: PLACE (but L is out), GAMET (but T isn’t in position 3), etc. A word that fits is “GATED”.

Check:
- G A T E D: ends with E, A appears here in position 2 which is still a no-go—so reject.
Next option: “MATED” – same issue, A in position 2.

We need A in 1 or 4 (since 5 is E). A word like “MANET” uses A in position 2 again – bad.

How about “GREAT”? ruled letters.

Wait, let’s list 5-letter words ending in E that contain A only in positions 1 or 4 and avoid the banned letters.

Candidate: “WAGED” – no, ends in D.

“FAKER” – has R and K not tried but R is banned.

“HAVEN” – ends in N.

“PATEN” – ends in N.

Try “DANCE” – C is banned.

“NAIVE” – I is banned.

“WAFER” – R is banned.

“LARGE” – L and R banned.

“CAKE” – too short.

“WAGED” – wrong ending.

Let me list systematically:
A must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for A).
Ending in E, avoid RISCBL.

Words with A in position 1: A _ _ _ E
- AWAKE – K and W new, K not yet tested. But position 2 is W, which is okay.
- AGAVE – V and G new.
- ABOVE – B is banned.
- ALONE – L is banned.
- ANODE – N, O, D new.

Words with A in position 4: _ _ _ A E
- None common (rare pattern).

So best choice appears “AWAKE”:

- A in position 1 (allowed)
- W, K, new letters
- No banned letters
- Ends in E as required
