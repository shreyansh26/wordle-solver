For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. I'll use ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it contains 5 very common letters - S, L, A, T, E - and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage of common letters and help identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

- T: x → not in the word

I need a 5-letter word that:

2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E

A good next guess would use a new set of common letters to narrow things down. ""RADIO"" is excellent because:
- It has R, D, I, O – all high-frequency letters not yet tested
- Places A in position 2 (different from position 3 in SLATE)
- Uses no excluded letters

Current revealed pattern: _ A _ D Y

Letters used that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, B, N

We still need:
- Position 1: any remaining consonant (C, M, P, G, F, etc.) but not S,L,T,R,B,N.
- Position 3: any remaining vowel/consonant except the banned ones.

Possible letters left for position 1/3: C, M, P, G, F, K, V, W, U (only vowel left), H

Good candidates fitting A in 2, D in 4, Y in 5:
1. C A M D Y – uses M (position 3), C (position 1), all fresh letters.
2. G A M D Y – same idea.
3. C A P D Y – uses P instead of M.
4. C A G D Y – uses G in position 3.

I’ll choose CAMDY (but that’s not a valid word). Wait, let me check real words:

- CANDY – but N is banned.
- HANDY – H is allowed, but N is banned.
- CARDY – is CARDY valid? Probably a variant spelling but not common.
- CADDY – but D is already in position 4, so position 3 can't be D (already used once? No, letters can repeat, but we have D at 4, so position 3 could be D, but we have no info that D appears twice).

Wait, we have no info about double letters yet.

But let’s look at common valid words: The only real word fitting _ A _ D Y with allowed letters is CADDY (position 3 could be D).

But we also have GADDY as a variant, but CADDY is more standard.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Y is still locked in position 5 (✓).

Overall pattern now known:

Thus the secret word has the form: _ A _ D Y

Among these, PADDY is definitely a valid, common English word.

Guess 3: BANDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(x) D(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on BANDY we now know:

BANDY → B(x) A(✓) N(x) D(✓) Y(✓)

So:
- A is in position 2 (already locked).
- D is confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- Y is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- B and N are NOT in the word.

Current revealed pattern: _ A _ D Y

Letters used that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, B, N

We still need:
- Position 1: any remaining consonant (C, M, P, G, F, etc.) but not S,L,T,R,B,N.
- Position 3: any remaining vowel/consonant except the banned ones.

Possible letters left for position 1/3: C, M, P, G, F, K, V, W, U (only vowel left), H

Good candidates fitting A in 2, D in 4, Y in 5:
1. C A M D Y – uses M (position 3), C (position 1), all fresh letters.
2. G A M D Y – same idea.
3. C A P D Y – uses P instead of M.
4. C A G D Y – uses G in position 3.

I’ll choose CAMDY (but that’s not a valid word). Wait, let me check real words:

- CANDY – but N is banned.
- HANDY – H is allowed, but N is banned.
- CARDY – is CARDY valid? Probably a variant spelling but not common.
- CADDY – but D is already in position 4, so position 3 can't be D (already used once? No, letters can repeat, but we have D at 4, so position 3 could be D, but we have no info that D appears twice).

Wait, we have no info about double letters yet.

But let’s look at common valid words: The only real word fitting _ A _ D Y with allowed letters is CADDY (position 3 could be D).

But we also have GADDY as a variant, but CADDY is more standard.

Another thought: FADDY – but F is rarer.

Let me choose CADDY as it is a real word and uses fresh C and second D.

<guess>CADDY</guess>Current pattern: _ A _ D Y  
Confirmed letters: A (pos 2), D (pos 4), Y (pos 5)  
Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, B, N  

The only common word fitting _ A _ D Y with remaining valid letters (C, M, P, G, H, K, V, W, F, U…) is CADDY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s process the newest feedback:

Guess 4: CADDY → C(x) A(✓) D(-) D(✓) Y(✓)

What it tells us:

- C is not in the word (x).
- A is still locked in position 2 (✓).
- The first D (position 3) is reported as (-): the letter D is in the word but **not in position 3**.
- The second D (position 4) is reported as (✓), so D is indeed in position 4.
- Y is still locked in position 5 (✓).

Overall pattern now known:
Position 2: A
Position 4: D
Position 5: Y

Thus the secret word has the form: _ A _ D Y

Letters **confirmed not in the word** so far:
S, L, T, E, R, I, O, B, N, C

Letters **still allowed** for positions 1 and 3 (and must be different from the banned set):
F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ A _ D Y with only those consonants.

Real candidate words matching this pattern:
- GADDY (variant spelling, uncommon)
- FADDY (rare)
- MADDY (nickname for Madeline, but uncommon)
- PADDY (common word)

Among these, PADDY is definitely a valid, common English word.

So, position 1: P
position 3: D (already allowed because the rule is “letter is in the word but wrong position” only for the first D in CADDY; having D again in position 3 is not restricted by that rule, since we still don’t know if D appears twice).

So the only possible pattern is _ A _ D Y.
Letters confirmed NOT present: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, B, N, C, P.

Remaining single-letter options for position 1 & 3 (must be real word):
Consonants left: F, G, H, K, M, V, W, etc.
Vowels left: U (only one left).

We need a valid word _ A _ D Y.
- If position 3 is D, it would violate D(-) from Guess 4 & 5 (D not in position 3).
So position 3 must be a vowel or consonant, but D is already in position 4.

The only common English word left is GAUDY:
- G (position 1) – allowed.
- A (position 2) – confirmed.
- U (position 3) – allowed and fits.
- D (position 4) – confirmed.
- Y (position 5) – confirmed.

No conflicts with any prior feedback.
