For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word.

Letters we now know:
1. Position 2 (A) is confirmed correct.
2. D is in the word and is in position 4 (fourth letter).
3. Second A in position 5 is wrong, so there is no second A; the word has exactly one A at position 2.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: P, N, S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

So the pattern is: _ A _ D _

Available letters (common ones we haven’t eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, Y, W, etc.

We still need to determine letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Matches _ A _ D _ exactly.
- Uses three new common letters to test positions 1, 3, 5.

A good candidate is “HACKY” but K is in position 3, Y in 5 – we want to test common consonants.

Another candidate: “MAMBA” – but we know no second A, so invalid.

Better: “MACAW” – C in 3, W in 5; but we don’t know about M yet and W is less common.

Next: “CAMBY” – but B is in position 5, Y is new.

Actually, let’s use “CABDY” but we already have D fixed in position 4.

Wait: the structure is _ A _ D _, so positions 1,3,5 need to be filled.

Good word: “MATCH” – but T is already eliminated.

Good word: “BANDY” – but N is eliminated.

Good word: “GAMDY” – D is fixed, so “GAMDY” invalid.

Let’s use “BADGY” – but G and Y are new, B is new. Is “BADGY” a word? No.

Next: “FAMDY” – not a word.

Realize: we need a valid English word of form _ A _ D _.

Good valid words: “HARDY”, “MARDY”, “BARDY”, “CARDY”, “WADDY”, “GADDY”.

Among these:
- “HARDY”: H, R, Y – R is eliminated (from RADIO feedback).

- “BARDY”: B, A, R, D, Y – R eliminated.
- “GADDY”: G, A, D, D, Y – D already in position 4, so second D would be in 5, but we have no info against double D, but this is less common.
- “WADDY”: W, A, D, D, Y – same issue.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to help narrow things down.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, O, I, N, C, D, U, G, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""RADIO"" because:
- It contains A (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
- It uses R, D, I, O which are common and will give us more information.

Alternative ideas could be ""CHAIR"" or ""MANGO"" but ""RADIO"" seems balanced.

- D(-): D is in the word but is in the wrong position (not position 3).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.

So far, we know:
1. The word has the form _ A _ _ _ (A in position 2).
2. The word contains D, but D is not in position 3.
3. The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

Remaining common letters: N, C, G, M, P, U, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Because D must appear somewhere, and cannot be in position 3, it could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains D in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses other untested common letters.

A good candidate is ""BADLY"":
- B: new letter to test.
- A: in position 2 (required).
- D: in position 3, but we know D is not in position 3! So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""CANDY"":
- C: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D, Y: new letters.
- D is in position 3, but again we know D is not in position 3.

Next: ""DANCE"":
- D: position 1 (allowed).
- A: position 2 (correct).
- N, C: new letters.
- E: already excluded, so invalid.

Next: ""BANDY"":
- B: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D, Y: new letters.
- D is in position 4 (allowed).
This seems valid.

Another option: ""PANDA"":
- P: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D: new letters.
- A: but we don't know if A appears twice, and this would have A in position 5, which is allowed for the second A.
But we don’t have info on double letters yet, and ""PANDA"" might be a good test.

From the feedback on CADDY:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).
- D(-) → The second D is in the word but in the wrong position.  
  Wait: the feedback for D in position 4 is D(✓) (from PANDA), so D is fixed in position 4.  
  Therefore the “D(-)” here must refer to the D in position 3, which tells us D is NOT in position 3 (already known from PANDA), so this is consistent.
- D(✓) in position 4 → confirms D is correctly placed at position 4.

Letters we have not yet ruled out for these positions (excluding all letters used so far):
Allowed: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, W

Common remaining letters: B, G, H, M, K.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ D Y.

Possible words:

- HANDY – N ruled out
- GAMDY – not valid
- CADDY – already used
- MARDY – R ruled out

- BARDY – R ruled out
- GARDY – R ruled out
- HANDY – N ruled out
- LARDY – L ruled out
- SANDY – S ruled out
- WADDY – W is allowed

Is WADDY a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, “waddy” (a heavy stick or club).

But we haven’t ruled out W, and it fits _ A _ D Y.

So let’s try WADDY.

However, let me double-check: we know D is fixed at position 4 and Y at 5, so positions 1 and 3 are open.

Words fitting _ A _ D Y:  
B A M D Y – not a word  
B A G D Y – not a word

Actually, the only common valid word left fitting the exact pattern _ A _ D Y with letters not yet eliminated is “GAMDY” but that isn’t a word.

Wait: “GANDY”? N is ruled out.

Realize the only valid word seems to be “BANDY” but N is out.

Realize the only valid candidate left is “BAGDY” – not a word.

Wait: “BAGGY” – but pattern is _ A _ D Y, so D must be in 4.

Actually, the only valid English word left fitting the pattern _ A _ D Y and using only non-eliminated letters is “GANDY” – N is out.

Let me reconsider: maybe “GAMDY” is misspelled.  
Correct word: “GAMDY” is invalid.  
Realize there is a single common word left: “BANDY” uses N which is ruled out.

But we made an error: the pattern is _ A _ D Y, and we have D at 4, Y at 5, A at 2.

Valid words fitting: “BANDY” – N out  
“CADDY” – done  
“PADDY” – P out

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,GAUDY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to help narrow things down.

Good remaining common letters to test: R, O, I, N, C, D, U, G, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""RADIO"" because:
- It contains A (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
- It uses R, D, I, O which are common and will give us more information.

Alternative ideas could be ""CHAIR"" or ""MANGO"" but ""RADIO"" seems balanced.

<guess>RADIO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in the word and is in position 2 (second letter).
- D(-): D is in the word but is in the wrong position (not position 3).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.

So far, we know:
1. The word has the form _ A _ _ _ (A in position 2).
2. The word contains D, but D is not in position 3.
3. The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

Remaining common letters: N, C, G, M, P, U, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.

Because D must appear somewhere, and cannot be in position 3, it could be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains D in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses other untested common letters.

A good candidate is ""BADLY"":
- B: new letter to test.
- A: in position 2 (required).
- D: in position 3, but we know D is not in position 3! So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""CANDY"":
- C: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D, Y: new letters.
- D is in position 3, but again we know D is not in position 3.

Next: ""DANCE"":
- D: position 1 (allowed).
- A: position 2 (correct).
- N, C: new letters.
- E: already excluded, so invalid.

Next: ""BANDY"":
- B: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D, Y: new letters.
- D is in position 4 (allowed).
This seems valid.

Another option: ""PANDA"":
- P: new letter.
- A: position 2.
- N, D: new letters.
- A: but we don't know if A appears twice, and this would have A in position 5, which is allowed for the second A.
But we don’t have info on double letters yet, and ""PANDA"" might be a good test.

Let me go with ""PANDA"".

<guess>PANDA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: PANDA -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) N(x) D(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

PANDA → P(x) A(✓) N(x) D(✓) A(-)

Letters we now know:
1. Position 2 (A) is confirmed correct.
2. D is in the word and is in position 4 (fourth letter).
3. Second A in position 5 is wrong, so there is no second A; the word has exactly one A at position 2.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: P, N, S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

So the pattern is: _ A _ D _

Available letters (common ones we haven’t eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, Y, W, etc.

We still need to determine letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Matches _ A _ D _ exactly.
- Uses three new common letters to test positions 1, 3, 5.

A good candidate is “HACKY” but K is in position 3, Y in 5 – we want to test common consonants.

Another candidate: “MAMBA” – but we know no second A, so invalid.

Better: “MACAW” – C in 3, W in 5; but we don’t know about M yet and W is less common.

Next: “CAMBY” – but B is in position 5, Y is new.

Actually, let’s use “CABDY” but we already have D fixed in position 4.

Wait: the structure is _ A _ D _, so positions 1,3,5 need to be filled.

Good word: “MATCH” – but T is already eliminated.

Good word: “BANDY” – but N is eliminated.

Good word: “GAMDY” – D is fixed, so “GAMDY” invalid.

Wait, let’s construct a word with:
- Position 1: C
- Position 3: M
- Position 5: B

“CAMDB” is not a word.

Alternative: “CAMBY” – valid word? Yes, “Camby” is a name but not a common English word.

Actually, “CANDY” was tried earlier but N is eliminated.

Let’s use “BADGY” – but G and Y are new, B is new. Is “BADGY” a word? No.

Next: “FAMDY” – not a word.

Realize: we need a valid English word of form _ A _ D _.

Good valid words: “HARDY”, “MARDY”, “BARDY”, “CARDY”, “WADDY”, “GADDY”.

Among these:
- “HARDY”: H, R, Y – R is eliminated (from RADIO feedback).
- “MARDY”: M, A, R, D, Y – R eliminated.
- “BARDY”: B, A, R, D, Y – R eliminated.
- “GADDY”: G, A, D, D, Y – D already in position 4, so second D would be in 5, but we have no info against double D, but this is less common.
- “WADDY”: W, A, D, D, Y – same issue.
- “CADDY”: C, A, D, D, Y – same.

Wait, “CADDY” is a valid word (golf caddy), and we haven’t eliminated C, Y, or a second D.

Let’s use “CADDY” to test C, potential second D, and Y.

- D(-) → The second D is in the word but in the wrong position.  
  Wait: the feedback for D in position 4 is D(✓) (from PANDA), so D is fixed in position 4.  
  Therefore the “D(-)” here must refer to the D in position 3, which tells us D is NOT in position 3 (already known from PANDA), so this is consistent.
- D(✓) in position 4 → confirms D is correctly placed at position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:
_ A _ D Y

Letters still unknown: position 1 and 3.
Letters we have not yet ruled out for these positions (excluding all letters used so far):
Allowed: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, W

Common remaining letters: B, G, H, M, K.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ D Y.

Possible words:
- BAGDY – not valid

- BANDY – N is ruled out
- HAMDY – not valid
- HANDY – N ruled out
- GAMDY – not valid
- CADDY – already used

- BARDY – R ruled out
- GARDY – R ruled out
- HANDY – N ruled out
- LARDY – L ruled out
- SANDY – S ruled out
- WADDY – W is allowed

Is WADDY a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, “waddy” (a heavy stick or club).

But we haven’t ruled out W, and it fits _ A _ D Y.

So let’s try WADDY.

However, let me double-check: we know D is fixed at position 4 and Y at 5, so positions 1 and 3 are open.

Words fitting _ A _ D Y:  
B A M D Y – not a word  
B A G D Y – not a word  
F A M D Y – not a word  
H A M D Y – not a word  
M A M D Y – not a word

Actually, the only common valid word left fitting the exact pattern _ A _ D Y with letters not yet eliminated is “GAMDY” but that isn’t a word.

Wait: “GANDY”? N is ruled out.

Realize the only valid word seems to be “BANDY” but N is out.

Realize the only valid candidate left is “BAGDY” – not a word.

Wait: “BAGGY” – but pattern is _ A _ D Y, so D must be in 4.

Actually, the only valid English word left fitting the pattern _ A _ D Y and using only non-eliminated letters is “GANDY” – N is out.

Let me reconsider: maybe “GAMDY” is misspelled.  
Correct word: “GAMDY” is invalid.  
Realize there is a single common word left: “BANDY” uses N which is ruled out.

But we made an error: the pattern is _ A _ D Y, and we have D at 4, Y at 5, A at 2.

Valid words fitting: “BANDY” – N out  
“CADDY” – done  
“PADDY” – P out  
“WADDY” – W is allowed, not yet tested.

So the only remaining valid word is “WADDY”.

From the feedback on WADDY we see:

- W(x) → W is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is locked in position 2 (already known).
- D(-) → D is in the word but not at position 3 (already known; it must be at 4).
- D(✓) → D is confirmed in position 4 (already known).
- Y(✓) → Y is confirmed in position 5.

So the exact pattern is now: _ A _ D Y with only positions 1 and 3 still unknown.

Letters we have already ruled out (from every guess so far):
S, L, T, E, R, I, O, P, N, C, W.

Common letters still available: B, F, G, H, K, M, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A _ D Y.

Let’s list candidates using only the allowed letters for positions 1 and 3:

- Position 1: B, F, G, H, K, M, U  
- Position 3: same set, but must form a real word.

Scanning our mental dictionary:

- BAGDY – invalid  
- BADGY – invalid  
- BAMDY – invalid  
- FAMDY – invalid  
- GAMDY – invalid  
- HAMDY – invalid  
- HAGDY – invalid  
- KAGDY – invalid  
- MAMDY – invalid  
- UAGDY – invalid  

None of these are words.

Let’s try consonant clusters in position 3 that yield real words:

The only valid English word left fitting _ A _ D Y with the remaining letters is:

F     A     N     D     Y   → “FANDY” (non-word)  
B     A     N     D     Y   → “BANDY” (N is eliminated)  
M     A     D     D     Y   → “MADDY” (D already at 4)  
B     A     D     D     Y   → “BADDY” (common spelling variant of “baddie”) but D is already fixed at 4, so second D in 3 is ok.

“BADDY” is listed in some dictionaries as a colloquial spelling of “baddie” (a bad person), and it is accepted by Wordle word lists.

Therefore the only remaining valid word is “BADDY”.

We can now confidently lock it in.

Pattern check:
B A D D Y
- B (position 1) – not yet tested
- A (position 2) – confirmed
- D (position 3) – ok because earlier “D(-)” only meant “not in position 3” for the guess where D appeared in position 3. Since D is already fixed at position 4, having a second D in position 3 is possible.
- D (position 4) – confirmed
- Y (position 5) – confirmed

Let’s guess “BADDY”.

<guess>BADDY</guess>",BADDY,"From the feedback on WADDY we see:

- W(x) → W is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is locked in position 2 (already known).
- D(-) → D is in the word but not at position 3 (already known; it must be at 4).
- D(✓) → D is confirmed in position 4 (already known).
- Y(✓) → Y is confirmed in position 5.

So the exact pattern is now: _ A _ D Y with only positions 1 and 3 still unknown.

B     A     D     D     Y   → “BADDY” (common spelling variant of “baddie”) but D is already fixed at 4, so second D in 3 is ok.

“BADDY” is listed in some dictionaries as a colloquial spelling of “baddie” (a bad person), and it is accepted by Wordle word lists.

Therefore the only remaining valid word is “BADDY”.
