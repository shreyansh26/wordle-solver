### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is the first guess, so we have no prior information. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are often recommended as they contain frequently occurring letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all common letters.

From the first-guess feedback (CRANE → C x, R -, A x, N x, E x) we already know:

- The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

Because the word must contain R somewhere, but positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from the A, N, E misses) and 1 (from C) are still open, we need a word that:

1. Includes R but not C, A, N, E.
2. Avoids any of the letters we have ruled out.

Good consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y.
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

A balanced second guess that introduces fresh common letters while keeping R is “TRIUM” (but it’s 5 letters and uses U). However, that uses U and M – good coverage. An alternative is “DRUID” but again checks D and U. To maximize fresh common letters, I’ll choose STORM. It re-uses R in a new spot (position 3) and brings in S, T, O, M – none of which have been ruled out.

From the two lines of feedback:

- Word contains R (but not in position 2 and now also not in position 4)
- Word contains S in position 1
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, M

So far we know:
Position 1 = S
R must appear in position 3 or 5 (since it’s not 2 or 4)
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s construct a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Places R in one of the two open positions (3 or 5)
3. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out and that haven’t appeared yet

Try S _ _ R _  → still need three more letters.
Try S _ R _ _  → then R is in position 3, need two more letters.

Good remaining consonants/vowels: D, G, H, I, K, L, U, Y

A strong candidate is “SHIRK”:
- S ✓ in position 1
- H, I, K not yet tested
- R in position 3 (valid)
