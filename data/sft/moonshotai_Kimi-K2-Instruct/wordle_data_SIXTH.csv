For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, I, O. 

A strong first word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and will likely reveal several letters in the word, regardless of what the secret word is.

From the first guess (SLATE) we have:

- L, A, E are not in the word at all x

So we know the pattern so far is:
S _ _ T _

Letters to avoid: L, A, E

We need three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5). Good consonants to try that haven't been used yet: R, N, M, P, C, D, etc. Good vowels left: I, O, U.

Let me think of common 5-letter words that fit S _ _ T _:
- SNORT (S ✓, N ?, O ?, R ?, T ✓) - but O is a vowel not yet tested
- STINT (but has double T, and I is unconfirmed)
- SPORT (S ✓, P ?, O ?, R ?, T ✓) - covers P, O, R
- SMOKE (but has E which we know is out)
- SWIFT (but has F, W - less common)
- SNOUT (but has U, N, O)

""SNORT"" seems good because:

- Doesn't use any excluded letters (L, A, E)

After two guesses we have:

- Word pattern: S _ _ T _ (from Guess 1: S ✓, T ✓)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E, N, O, R (from the x’s and the – on T)

But notice that T was marked “-” in Guess 2, which is impossible because T was already locked into position 4 by Guess 1.  
Therefore the feedback for Guess 2 should be interpreted as:

S ✓, N x, O x, R x, T ✓ (i.e., the final character “T” must be in position 4 and thus gets ✓, not “-”).

So we still have:
S _ _ T _

We need three new letters for positions 2, 3, 5 that are not in the excluded list.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

Let’s pick “SHIFT” to test F, H, I.

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed: I (indicated by “-”, so I must be in position 2 or 3).

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ _ T H that contains I somewhere in positions 2 or 3, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible words fitting S _ I T H or S I _ T H:

- S I _ T H → “SIGHT” is a valid word (G hasn’t been ruled out).  
  Check letters: S, I, G, H, T – none are in the excluded list.  
- S _ I T H → nothing common comes to mind.

So “SIGHT” is a very strong candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, I, O. 

A strong first word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters and will likely reveal several letters in the word, regardless of what the secret word is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (SLATE) we have:
- S is in the correct first spot ✓
- T is in the correct fourth spot ✓
- L, A, E are not in the word at all x

So we know the pattern so far is:
S _ _ T _

Letters to avoid: L, A, E

We need three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5). Good consonants to try that haven't been used yet: R, N, M, P, C, D, etc. Good vowels left: I, O, U.

Let me think of common 5-letter words that fit S _ _ T _:
- SNORT (S ✓, N ?, O ?, R ?, T ✓) - but O is a vowel not yet tested
- STINT (but has double T, and I is unconfirmed)
- SPORT (S ✓, P ?, O ?, R ?, T ✓) - covers P, O, R
- SMOKE (but has E which we know is out)
- SWIFT (but has F, W - less common)
- SNOUT (but has U, N, O)

""SNORT"" seems good because:
- Uses N, O, R which are common letters
- Fits S ✓ _ _ T ✓ pattern
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (L, A, E)

Let's go with SNORT.

<guess>SNORT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: SNORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>After two guesses we have:

- Word pattern: S _ _ T _ (from Guess 1: S ✓, T ✓)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E, N, O, R (from the x’s and the – on T)

But notice that T was marked “-” in Guess 2, which is impossible because T was already locked into position 4 by Guess 1.  
Therefore the feedback for Guess 2 should be interpreted as:

S ✓, N x, O x, R x, T ✓ (i.e., the final character “T” must be in position 4 and thus gets ✓, not “-”).

So we still have:
S _ _ T _

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: L, A, E, N, O, R

We need three new letters for positions 2, 3, 5 that are not in the excluded list.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A common word fitting S _ _ T _ and using only allowed letters is “SPITZ,” but Z is uncommon.  
A safer choice is “SHIFT” – but F and H haven’t been ruled out yet, and we haven’t tested I.

Let’s pick “SHIFT” to test F, H, I.

Wait – T is already locked at position 4, so word must end with T. We need a 5-letter word S _ _ T _.

“SHIFT” ends with T, so positions 2,3 are F and I.

Let’s use “SHIFT”.

But we already have T at position 4, so letters to test are F, H, I.

Actually, let’s choose a word that tests more useful letters. A better choice is “SMITH” – but H hasn’t been tested yet.

Another option: “SQUAT” – but Q and U haven’t been tested, and Q is rare.

Let’s go with “SMITH” because:
- S ✓
- M not yet tested
- I not yet tested
- T ✓
- H not yet tested

So SMITH seems solid.

Let me double-check: all letters are allowed (no L,A,E,N,O,R).

Yes.

Let's carefully reinterpret the feedback.

Guess 4: SIGHT  
- S ✓ → position 1 is S (already certain)  
- I ✓ → position 2 is I  
- G x → G is NOT in the word  
- H – → H is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in position 3)  
- T – → T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it must be in position 3)

But positions 4 and 5 can’t BOTH be position 3.  
The only way the feedback makes sense is if the final symbol for H and T was meant to indicate they are both in the word but in the **wrong positions**—yet we already know T is in position 4 (locked from guess 1). This suggests a possible mis-notation. Interpreting strictly:

- H “–” means H is somewhere else in the word.  
- T “–” would imply T is elsewhere, but we already have T locked in position 4, so T must have been intended as ✓.

Therefore the pattern must be:

S I _ _ _   (I now locked in position 2)  
and H must appear in position 3, 4, or 5.  
But positions 4 and 5 are already T and H, so H must be in position 3.

Hence the pattern is: S I H T _

Only the 5th letter remains unknown.

Letters so far confirmed: S, I, H, T  
Letters known not to appear: L, A, E, N, O, R, M, G  

Remaining legal letters: B, C, D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words matching S I H T _ :
- S I H T _ → “SIETH” isn’t an English word  
- “SIGHT” already tried  
- There is no standard English word spelled S I H T X.

Rechecking feedback for any misinterpretation: If the feedback actually meant:

- H(–) → H is in word, wrong place  
- T(–) → T is in word, wrong place  

then the only consistent pattern with earlier feedback is:

S I _ _ _   (I ✓)  
T must still be in position 4 (from guess 1), so T cannot be “wrong place” – contradiction.  

Hence the only consistent reading is that the final two symbols were meant as:

- H(✓)  
- T(✓)  

making the full pattern S I _ T H, and the letter G is out.

Therefore the 3rd letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

A common word fitting S I _ T H is:

- S I C T H → “SICTH” – invalid  
- S I F T H → “SIFTH” – invalid  
- S I X T H → “SIXTH” – X is allowed (not ruled out) and fits perfectly.

Let’s choose SIXTH.

Therefore the 3rd letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

A common word fitting S I _ T H is:

- S I C T H → “SICTH” – invalid
