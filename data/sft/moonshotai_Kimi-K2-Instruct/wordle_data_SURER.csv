For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

3. O(x) → O is not in the word.
4. S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.

- Does NOT contain A or O
- The letters R, S, E are each somewhere other than positions 2, 4, 5 respectively.

Good next strategy: include the confirmed letters (R, S, E) and try new common consonants plus the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).

The feedback from Guess 3 (SUPER) tells us:

1. S(✓) → S is correct in position 1.
2. U(✓) → U is correct in position 2.
3. P(x) → P is not in the word at all.
4. E(✓) → E is correct in position 4.
5. R(✓) → R is correct in position 5.

Thus, the word pattern is now fully determined:

- Position 1: S
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

From earlier feedback, we know the letters A, O, T, I, P are not in the word. The only remaining common 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is “SU??R”. Common letters for position 3 that aren’t forbidden (A, O, T, I, P) and haven’t been ruled out include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y.

Testing quickly:
- SUBER (not a valid word)
- SUCER (not a valid word)
- SUER (only 4 letters)
- SUVER (not valid)
- SUGER (not valid)
- SUNER (not valid)
- SULER (not valid)
- SUDER (not valid)
- SURER (valid word)

“SURER” fits perfectly: S U R E R, with R in position 3 (allowed since earlier feedback only ruled out R not in positions 2 or 3 specifically from earlier guesses, but position 3 is now free). Checking constraints:
- Contains S, U, E, R
- No A, O, T, I, P
- Matches positions S U _ E R exactly.

Thus, the only plausible word here is SURER.
