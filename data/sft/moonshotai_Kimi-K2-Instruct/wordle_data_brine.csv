For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers many common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. These words contain frequently used vowels and consonants.

Considering this, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters
- It has 3 consonants and 2 vowels (A, E)
- The letters are well-distributed across the alphabet
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the mystery word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- All letters except E are NOT in the word (S, L, A, T all marked with x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).

So our target word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, or T.

Common 5-letter words ending in E that avoid S, L, A, T:
- BIRCH (contains C and H, no forbidden letters)
- GRIPE
- CHIME
- PRIDE
- BRINE

""BRINE"" seems like a good choice because:
- Ends with E (matches feedback)
- Uses common letters B, R, I, N which haven't been tested yet
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T)
- Good mix of consonants and vowels
