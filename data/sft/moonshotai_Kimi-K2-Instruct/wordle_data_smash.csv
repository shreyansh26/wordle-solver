For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: Covers S, L, A, T, E - good distribution
- CRANE: Covers C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants and vowels
- AROSE: Covers A, R, O, S, E - includes O which appears in many words

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has excellent letter distribution and frequency analysis shows these are among the most common letters in English 5-letter words, which should give us good initial information.

- C, R, N, and E are NOT in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (4th spot)

So the word has A in the 4th position and no C, R, N, or E elsewhere. I’ll now look for a 5-letter word that:
- Has A as the 4th letter ( _ _ _ A _ )
- Uses none of the letters C, R, N, E

A good next step is to test common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The letters B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y are still possible.

A word like ""SLAID"" satisfies all constraints (S, L, A, I, D), but ""A"" is already locked in position 4. A better choice is ""PLAID"" (P, L, A, I, D) to test P, L, I, D.

<think>
Possible structure: _ _ _ A _
Letters to avoid: C, R, N, E
Good candidates: PLAID (P, L, A, I, D), SLAIN (but N is excluded), FLOAT (O, T, A), BLAST (B, L, A, S, T - but A is already fixed at 4)
PLAID is optimal as it introduces 3 new consonants (P, L, D) and 1 new vowel (I).

4. Remaining usable consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
5. Remaining usable vowels: U (all others are eliminated or placed).

We still need four more letters:
- One of them must be S, but not in position 5.
- We can use U for the remaining vowel, since A is already placed.

A promising pattern: S _ _ A _ (S in position 1) or _ S _ A _ (S in position 2) or _ _ S A _ (S in position 3).

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A _ with S not in position 5:
- SHARK – but R and K are still allowed? R was eliminated (from CRANE feedback), so no.
- SWASH – repeats S and has W, but S is already in feedback.
- BUMPY – vowel U, consonants B, M, P; P eliminated.
- HUMAS – H, U, M, A, S: fits pattern _ U M A S.

Wait: H, U, M were never eliminated, and S must be somewhere. ""HUMAS"" has S in position 5, which is forbidden. So need S elsewhere.

Try ""HUMSA"" – but that's not a valid English word.

Try ""S _ _ A _"": S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Good candidate: ""SQUAB"" – but B is allowed and Q, U fit. However, B is the last letter. Pattern _ _ _ A _: no, SQUAB is S Q U A B, which fits _ _ _ A _ perfectly (A in position 4), and letters S, Q, U, B not eliminated.

But we have S in position 1 (allowed), Q, U, B not eliminated. This seems valid.

Actually, let's double-check eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, D, G, O, T. The letters in SQUAB are S, Q, U, A, B. None of these are eliminated. And A is confirmed in position 4. S is in the word (from feedback) and not in position 5 here. This satisfies all constraints.

So ""SQUAB"" is a valid guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- CRANE: Covers C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants and vowels
- AROSE: Covers A, R, O, S, E - includes O which appears in many words

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has excellent letter distribution and frequency analysis shows these are among the most common letters in English 5-letter words, which should give us good initial information.

Good candidate: ""SQUAB"" – but B is allowed and Q, U fit. However, B is the last letter. Pattern _ _ _ A _: no, SQUAB is S Q U A B, which fits _ _ _ A _ perfectly (A in position 4), and letters S, Q, U, B not eliminated.

But we have S in position 1 (allowed), Q, U, B not eliminated. This seems valid.

Actually, let's double-check eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, D, G, O, T. The letters in SQUAB are S, Q, U, A, B. None of these are eliminated. And A is confirmed in position 4. S is in the word (from feedback) and not in position 5 here. This satisfies all constraints.

So ""SQUAB"" is a valid guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated facts:
- Pattern: _ _ _ A _ became _ _ A _ _ (because SQUAB feedback says A is in word but now in wrong position)
- S is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, D, G, O, T, Q, U, B
- Remaining usable letters (consonants): F, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining usable vowels: A (must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 since position 4 is wrong now)

We now know the word starts with S and has A somewhere not in position 4. Possible patterns:
1. S A _ _ _
2. S _ A _ _
3. S _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with S and avoiding all eliminated letters:
- SHARK (H, R available? No, R eliminated)
- SMARM (M, A, R - R eliminated)
- SWAMI (W, M, I - I eliminated)
- SHAVE (H, V, E - E eliminated)
- SHAKY (H, K, Y - all allowed)

""SHAKY"" fits:
- S(✓) already confirmed
- H, K, Y not eliminated
- A is in position 2 (pattern S A _ _ _)
- Only uses allowed letters

This seems like the best next guess.

From the latest feedback on SHAKY:
- S is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 3.
- H is in the word but not in position 2.
- K and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
1. S at position 1: S _ _ _ _
2. A at position 3: S _ A _ _
3. Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, D, G, O, T, Q, U, B, K, Y
4. Available letters (consonants): F, M, V, W, X, H
5. Available vowels: A (already placed), none else (only A and E, O, I, U have been tried).

We need to fill positions 2 and 5. We also know H must be in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S _ A H _ (H at 4)
- S _ A _ H (H at 5)

Looking at remaining consonants (F, M, V, W, X) and H, and knowing position 2 must be one of F, M, V, W, X.

Possible words:
- S F A H _ – but no usable letter left for position 5 (remaining are F, M, V, W, X, but H is used at 4)
- S M A H _ – same issue
- S _ A _ H – H is at 5, so position 2 must be F, M, V, W, or X.

Between these, ""SMASH"" comes to mind but:
- M is allowed
- A is at 3
- S is at 1
- H is at 5
- Second S is allowed (repetition not forbidden)

But is ""SMASH"" valid? Letters are S, M, A, S, H. All letters are allowed (S, M, A, H not in eliminated list). This fits all constraints.

Another option is ""SHASH"" but H cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so invalid.

Thus, ""SMASH"" is the only valid word left with current constraints.
