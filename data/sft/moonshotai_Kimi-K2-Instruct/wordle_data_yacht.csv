Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. A classic choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This word tests 3 vowels and 2 highly frequent consonants, giving us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x) we know:

• A is in the word but not in position 1.
• R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A, but A is not the first letter.
- does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

A sensible next guess should use different vowels and consonants to maximize information. We need a word that:
- avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- has the letter A somewhere other than first position.
- introduces other frequent letters such as T, N, L, C, D, I, U, etc.

Good candidates include:
- TAINT (uses T, A, I, N) — but A is only in position 2, so if A isn’t in 2, it won’t help much.
- PLAIN — uses P, L, A, I, N and spreads A across positions.

I’ll go with PLAIN because it includes the known letter A (in position 3), tests the popular consonants P, L, N and the vowel I, none of which were used before.

So far we know:

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3.
- R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N are all absent.

That leaves us with letters like D, T, C, U, B, M, G, H, K, Y, etc., plus the known presence of A (positions 2, 4, or 5).

We still have no positional info for A, so we want a word that:
1. Places A in a new position (2 or 4 or 5).
2. Uses only still-possible letters (none of the banned ones).
3. Tests a new set of common consonants to maximize information.

A good choice is “GUARD”:
- G, U, D haven’t been tested.
- R is banned, but D isn’t, and it checks position 4 for A.
- All letters are still allowed.

So:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: A (new position)
- Positions 1, 4, 5: G, R, D (but R is banned, so this word fails!)

Oops, R is banned. Let’s pick another. How about “GUAVA”?
- G, U, V allowed.
- A in positions 3 and 5. Hmm, A is now tested in positions 2, 3, 5. But V is less common.

Maybe “GUMMY”? No A.

“BANAL”? B, N, L allowed, but L banned.

“TABBY”? T, B, Y allowed.

But best is a word that places A in position 2 or 5, uses fresh letters. “TAMBA” has M, B, T, A, but double A is redundant.

Let’s use “MADAM”:
- M, D allowed.
- A tested in positions 2 and 4.

But D is allowed.

Actually, a better candidate is “MADAM”:
- Letters: M, A, D (allowed), but M is allowed.
- A in positions 2 and 4.

But simpler is “GUARD” is invalid due to R.

Next best: “GUAVA”:
- G, U, A, V allowed.
- A in positions 3 and 5.

But V is low-frequency.

Another candidate: “CABBY”:
- C, B, Y allowed.
- A in position 2.

This tests C, B, Y, A new position.

Yes, CABBY uses:
- C, A, B, B, Y
- A in position 2 (new)
- C, B, Y fresh letters (none banned).

From the new feedback:

- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓): A is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.
- B(x) B(x): The letter B is NOT in the word.
- Y(-): Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far:
- Known letters: A (fixed at position 2), C (somewhere else), Y (somewhere else).
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, B.
- Still-allowed letters: A (locked at 2), C, Y, plus any untested letters among D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. A at position 2.
2. C placed somewhere not position 1.
3. Y placed somewhere not position 5.
4. No other forbidden letters.

Possible positions:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 1: C is allowed (but feedback says C is not at 1, so C can be 3,4 or 5)
- Position 5: Y is not allowed (so Y must be 3 or 4)

Let’s list plausible words:
- C could be 3,4,5
- Y could be 3,4
- Other slots filled from {D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z}

One good candidate: “GAMAY”:
- G, M, Y allowed.
- A at 2, Y at 4, C not used, but C must be used. So not this.

We **must** include C and Y.

Try “CYANO”: but O is banned.

How about “MACHY”:
- M, A, C, H, Y.
- A at 2, C at 3, Y at 5 — but Y cannot be at 5. So invalid.

Next: “CACHE” — but C at 1, E banned.

“CATCH” — C at 1, T, H, C at 4, but C already in 1, and H is allowed. But C is not at 1, so invalid.

“YACCA” — C at 4, but A at 2, but double A and C at 4. Y at 1 is allowed.

“YACCA”:
- Y at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (correct), C at 3 and 4 (but C is only once in word? The word must use letters only as they appear, so this is invalid because it uses C twice but we don’t know if C is twice).

Actually, we don’t have info on duplicates, so we can assume single letters for now.

Let’s try “MACHY” but adjust: We need C and Y.

“MACHY” fails as Y at 5 is invalid.

Next candidate: “HACKY”:
- H at 1, A at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5 — but Y at 5 invalid.

“YACHT”:
- Y at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, T at 5.
- C is not at 1 (it’s at 3), Y is not at 5 (it’s at 1), and all letters are allowed.

This fits all constraints.

Check:
- A is at 2 (correct).
- C is at 3 (not at 1) → matches C(-).
- Y is at 1 (not at 5) → matches Y(-).
- No banned letters used.

Thus, “YACHT” is a valid next guess.
