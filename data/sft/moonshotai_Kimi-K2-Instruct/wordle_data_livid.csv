For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good options include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help me quickly identify which letters are in the target word.

Every letter in AROSE was marked “x”, meaning none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a very strong filter: none of those 5 vowels or consonants are present.

I need a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses common remaining letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and Y).

A balanced, high-information word avoiding the forbidden letters:
- T: very common  
- I: useful vowel  
- N, L, C: common consonants  

“TINCL” isn’t valid, but “TULIP” uses T, U, L, I, P — all allowed.  
Another solid choice is “UNTIL”.

I’ll go with “UNTIL”:
- U, I (vowels)  
- N, T, L (common consonants)  
All five letters are unused so far.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T (all x-marked in guesses 1 and 2).
- The letter I is confirmed in the correct position (✓ at position 4).
- The letter L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word has:
- 4th letter = I
- Contains L somewhere other than position 5
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T

Remaining consonants to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already placed), plus Y can act as a vowel.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- _ _ _ I _
- L must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- No forbidden letters

Possible patterns:
- L _ _ I _
- _ L _ I _
- _ _ L I _
- _ _ _ I L

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns:
- ""LIPID"" – but P and D are allowed, but we have no info yet
- ""FILMY"" – F, I, L, M, Y (all allowed)
- ""BLIMP"" – B, L, I, M, P (all allowed)
- ""CLIMB"" – C, L, I, M, B (all allowed)

I’ll choose ""FILMY"" as it uses F, I, L, M, Y – all permitted letters and gives good coverage of remaining consonants and vowel-like Y.

Positions:
- F(1), I(4), L(3), M(5), Y(2) – but we need to check if this fits the constraints:
  - I is at position 4 (✓)
  - L is at position 3 (allowed since previous guess had L at position 5 and it was marked -)
  - All letters unused so far.

- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (so L must be in position 1 or 2)

Remaining letters to choose from (excluding all forbidden ones, and keeping I fixed at 4 and L in 1 or 2):
- Consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Vowels left: none (I is already placed and the rest are excluded); sometimes Y is considered, but Y has already been ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 4th letter = I
- L must appear once, at position 1 or 2
- Two other consonants (or repeats) from the allowed list, placed in the remaining slots

Possible patterns:
1) L _ _ I _
2) _ L _ I _

Let’s list common English words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters:

Pattern 1 (L _ _ I _):
- L B _ I _ – e.g., “LB” rare, no common word
- L C _ I _ – “L C D I _” no
- L P _ I _ – “L P D I _” no
- L K _ I _ – “L K D I _” no
- L H _ I _ – “L H D I _” no
- L D _ I _ – “L D B I _” – “LD” unlikely
- L V _ I _ – “L V D I _” no
- L G _ I _ – “L G D I _” no

Pattern 2 (_ L _ I _):
- B L _ I _ – “BL _ I _” – “BLIMP” but M is excluded
- C L _ I _ – “CL _ I _” – “CLIMB” but B not yet forbidden (C, L, I, M, B – M is forbidden) → “CLIMB” has M
- D L _ I _ – “DL” rare
- G L _ I _ – “GL” rare
- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLINK” but N excluded
- V L _ I _ – “VL” rare
- W L _ I _ – “WL” rare
- H L _ I _ – “HL” rare
- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLICK” (valid word, C allowed), let’s check: P, L, I, C, K – all letters allowed so far.

The word “PLICK” is valid:
- P, L, I, C, K
- I is in position 4 ✓
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback ruled out L in 3 and 5)
- P, C, K have not been tested and are not yet excluded.

Therefore, my next guess is “PLICK”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good options include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help me quickly identify which letters are in the target word.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Every letter in AROSE was marked “x”, meaning none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a very strong filter: none of those 5 vowels or consonants are present.

I need a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses common remaining letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and Y).

A balanced, high-information word avoiding the forbidden letters:
- T: very common  
- I: useful vowel  
- N, L, C: common consonants  

“TINCL” isn’t valid, but “TULIP” uses T, U, L, I, P — all allowed.  
Another solid choice is “UNTIL”.

I’ll go with “UNTIL”:
- U, I (vowels)  
- N, T, L (common consonants)  
All five letters are unused so far.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T (all x-marked in guesses 1 and 2).
- The letter I is confirmed in the correct position (✓ at position 4).
- The letter L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word has:
- 4th letter = I
- Contains L somewhere other than position 5
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T

Remaining consonants to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already placed), plus Y can act as a vowel.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- _ _ _ I _
- L must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- No forbidden letters

Possible patterns:
- L _ _ I _
- _ L _ I _
- _ _ L I _
- _ _ _ I L

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns:
- ""LIPID"" – but P and D are allowed, but we have no info yet
- ""FILMY"" – F, I, L, M, Y (all allowed)
- ""BLIMP"" – B, L, I, M, P (all allowed)
- ""CLIMB"" – C, L, I, M, B (all allowed)

I’ll choose ""FILMY"" as it uses F, I, L, M, Y – all permitted letters and gives good coverage of remaining consonants and vowel-like Y.

Positions:
- F(1), I(4), L(3), M(5), Y(2) – but we need to check if this fits the constraints:
  - I is at position 4 (✓)
  - L is at position 3 (allowed since previous guess had L at position 5 and it was marked -)
  - All letters unused so far.

- C L _ I _ – “CL _ I _” – “CLIMB” but B not yet forbidden (C, L, I, M, B – M is forbidden) → “CLIMB” has M

- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLINK” but N excluded
- V L _ I _ – “VL” rare

- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLICK” (valid word, C allowed), let’s check: P, L, I, C, K – all letters allowed so far.

The word “PLICK” is valid:
- P, L, I, C, K
- I is in position 4 ✓
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback ruled out L in 3 and 5)

Let me re-express what we now know after four guesses.

Letters absolutely NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y, P, C, K   (14 letters ruled out)

Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- L (must appear once)  
- I (must appear at least once, but its position is no longer locked at 4!)

From Guess 4 (PLICK):
- I got “I(-)” which means the letter I is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we seek a 5-letter word that:
1. contains both L and I somewhere,  
2. does **not** contain any of the 14 letters listed above,  
3. has I **not** in position 4.

Remaining eligible letters:  
B, D, G, H, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus repeats of those)

We must form a valid English word using only those letters (with L and I each at least once).

Possible word forms that satisfy:
- _ L _ I _  
- _ I _ L _  
- L _ I _ _  
- L _ _ _ I  
- _ _ L I _  
- _ _ I L _  
- _ I L _ _  
- etc., while respecting “I not in position 4”.

Scanning the remaining letters and common English words, the only practical candidates that leap to mind are:

BLIGH  – contains B, L, I, G, H; all allowed.  
GLIBB – but double B and not a common word.  
BLIGH is the more standard choice.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, L, I, G, H – none are in the forbidden list.  
- Contains both L and I.  
- I appears in position 3, so position 4 is safe.

Therefore I’ll guess BLIGH.

(If BLIGH turns out wrong, the next best rare allowed word would be GLIBB or BILGE, but BLIGH seems most plausible.)
</think>

<guess>BLIGH</guess>",BLIGH,"Let me re-express what we now know after four guesses.

Letters absolutely NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y, P, C, K   (14 letters ruled out)

Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- L (must appear once)  
- I (must appear at least once, but its position is no longer locked at 4!)

From Guess 4 (PLICK):
- I got “I(-)” which means the letter I is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we seek a 5-letter word that:
1. contains both L and I somewhere,  
2. does **not** contain any of the 14 letters listed above,  
3. has I **not** in position 4.

Remaining eligible letters:  
B, D, G, H, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus repeats of those)

We must form a valid English word using only those letters (with L and I each at least once).

Possible word forms that satisfy:
- _ L _ I _  
- _ I _ L _  
- L _ I _ _  
- L _ _ _ I  
- _ _ L I _  
- _ _ I L _  
- _ I L _ _  
- etc., while respecting “I not in position 4”.

Scanning the remaining letters and common English words, the only practical candidates that leap to mind are:

BLIGH  – contains B, L, I, G, H; all allowed.  
GLIBB – but double B and not a common word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good options include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help me quickly identify which letters are in the target word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Every letter in AROSE was marked “x”, meaning none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a very strong filter: none of those 5 vowels or consonants are present.

I need a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses common remaining letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and Y).

A balanced, high-information word avoiding the forbidden letters:
- T: very common  
- I: useful vowel  
- N, L, C: common consonants  

“TINCL” isn’t valid, but “TULIP” uses T, U, L, I, P — all allowed.  
Another solid choice is “UNTIL”.

I’ll go with “UNTIL”:
- U, I (vowels)  
- N, T, L (common consonants)  
All five letters are unused so far.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T (all x-marked in guesses 1 and 2).
- The letter I is confirmed in the correct position (✓ at position 4).
- The letter L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word has:
- 4th letter = I
- Contains L somewhere other than position 5
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T

Remaining consonants to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already placed), plus Y can act as a vowel.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- _ _ _ I _
- L must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- No forbidden letters

Possible patterns:
- L _ _ I _
- _ L _ I _
- _ _ L I _
- _ _ _ I L

Let’s think of common words fitting these patterns:
- ""LIPID"" – but P and D are allowed, but we have no info yet
- ""FILMY"" – F, I, L, M, Y (all allowed)
- ""BLIMP"" – B, L, I, M, P (all allowed)
- ""CLIMB"" – C, L, I, M, B (all allowed)

I’ll choose ""FILMY"" as it uses F, I, L, M, Y – all permitted letters and gives good coverage of remaining consonants and vowel-like Y.

Positions:
- F(1), I(4), L(3), M(5), Y(2) – but we need to check if this fits the constraints:
  - I is at position 4 (✓)
  - L is at position 3 (allowed since previous guess had L at position 5 and it was marked -)
  - All letters unused so far.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y
- Letter I is in position 4 (✓)
- Letter L is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (so L must be in position 1 or 2)

Remaining letters to choose from (excluding all forbidden ones, and keeping I fixed at 4 and L in 1 or 2):
- Consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Vowels left: none (I is already placed and the rest are excluded); sometimes Y is considered, but Y has already been ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 4th letter = I
- L must appear once, at position 1 or 2
- Two other consonants (or repeats) from the allowed list, placed in the remaining slots

Possible patterns:
1) L _ _ I _
2) _ L _ I _

Let’s list common English words fitting these patterns with the allowed letters:

Pattern 1 (L _ _ I _):
- L B _ I _ – e.g., “LB” rare, no common word
- L C _ I _ – “L C D I _” no
- L P _ I _ – “L P D I _” no
- L K _ I _ – “L K D I _” no
- L H _ I _ – “L H D I _” no
- L D _ I _ – “L D B I _” – “LD” unlikely
- L V _ I _ – “L V D I _” no
- L G _ I _ – “L G D I _” no

Pattern 2 (_ L _ I _):
- B L _ I _ – “BL _ I _” – “BLIMP” but M is excluded
- C L _ I _ – “CL _ I _” – “CLIMB” but B not yet forbidden (C, L, I, M, B – M is forbidden) → “CLIMB” has M
- D L _ I _ – “DL” rare
- G L _ I _ – “GL” rare
- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLINK” but N excluded
- V L _ I _ – “VL” rare
- W L _ I _ – “WL” rare
- H L _ I _ – “HL” rare
- P L _ I _ – “PL _ I _” – “PLICK” (valid word, C allowed), let’s check: P, L, I, C, K – all letters allowed so far.

The word “PLICK” is valid:
- P, L, I, C, K
- I is in position 4 ✓
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback ruled out L in 3 and 5)
- P, C, K have not been tested and are not yet excluded.

Therefore, my next guess is “PLICK”.

Letters absolutely NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y, P, C, K   (14 letters ruled out)

Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- L (must appear once)  
- I (must appear at least once, but its position is no longer locked at 4!)

From Guess 4 (PLICK):
- I got “I(-)” which means the letter I is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we seek a 5-letter word that:
1. contains both L and I somewhere,  
2. does **not** contain any of the 14 letters listed above,  
3. has I **not** in position 4.

Remaining eligible letters:  
B, D, G, H, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus repeats of those)

We must form a valid English word using only those letters (with L and I each at least once).

Possible word forms that satisfy:
- _ L _ I _  
- _ I _ L _  
- L _ I _ _  
- L _ _ _ I  
- _ _ L I _

Let’s summarize the hard facts after five guesses.

Letters that are definitely **not** in the secret word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y, P, C, K, B, G, H   (17 letters ruled out)

Letters that **must** appear at least once:
- L  (marked “-” in every guess that contained it, so it is somewhere)
- I  (also marked “-” in every guess that contained it, and never ✓, so it is in the word but not yet in the correct slot)

Remaining letters that are still legal to use:
D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus repeats of these)

We also know:
- Position 4 is **not** I (Guess 4 showed I(-) when I was in position 4).
- L has never been in the correct position in any guess so far, eliminating certain slots for L.

We need a 5-letter English word that uses only the 9 legal letters above, includes both L and I, and leaves position 4 open for something other than I.

Possible patterns:
Since many consonants are now gone, the only plausible common word left is “JILID” (a rare spelling variant) or “WILID” (not a word).  Actually, the only recognizable word that fits is **BLIND** but B, N, D are ruled out.  

Looking again at the letters D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z, the only valid 5-letter English word I can construct that contains both L and I is:

- **WILID** – not valid
- **JILID** – not common
- **LIVID** – contains V, I, D, L (D is allowed still).  LIVID is a real word.

Let me check LIVID:
- Letters L, I, V, I, D  
- All letters are in the allowed set (D, V, L, I).  
- Contains both required letters L and I.  
- I appears in positions 2 and 4, but we know position 4 cannot be I (from Guess 4).  LIVID has I in positions 2 and 4, so it violates the “I not in position 4” rule.

Next possibility: **DIVIL** – but again I would be in position 4.

**LIVID** and **DIVIL** are invalid because they place I in position 4.

Next try: **WILDL** – not a word.

**JILDL** – not a word.

The only 5-letter word that fits is “WILDL” (invalid) or “WILDI” (not a word).

Realizing that **D** is still allowed, and letters left are D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z, the only valid English word is **LIVID** but that puts I in position 4.  Therefore, there must be another pattern.

Wait – the word **LIVID** is 5 letters, but the I’s are in positions 2 and 4.  Since position 4 cannot be I, this is impossible.

Another try: **WILDI** – again I in position 4.

**DILLY** – Y is ruled out.

**WILLY** – Y ruled out.

**WILDL** – invalid.

**JILDL** – invalid.

**JILLY** – Y ruled out.

**VILDI** – I in position 4.

**VIDLI** – I in position 5, but not a word.

**VILLI** – 5-letter word, uses V, I, L, L, I – all allowed letters.  Positions:
V I L L I  
- I is in positions 2 and 5, never position 4 – satisfies all constraints.  
- Contains L (positions 3,4) and I (positions 2,5).  
- All letters are from the permitted set.

Thus, **VILLI** is a valid guess.

Therefore, the next logical guess is VILLI.

<guess>VILLI</guess>",VILLI,"Let’s summarize the hard facts after five guesses.

Letters that are definitely **not** in the secret word:
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M, Y, P, C, K, B, G, H   (17 letters ruled out)

Letters that **must** appear at least once:
- L  (marked “-” in every guess that contained it, so it is somewhere)
- I  (also marked “-” in every guess that contained it, and never ✓, so it is in the word but not yet in the correct slot)

Remaining letters that are still legal to use:
D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus repeats of these)

We also know:
- Position 4 is **not** I (Guess 4 showed I(-) when I was in position 4).
- L has never been in the correct position in any guess so far, eliminating certain slots for L.

We need a 5-letter English word that uses only the 9 legal letters above, includes both L and I, and leaves position 4 open for something other than I.

Possible patterns:
Since many consonants are now gone, the only plausible common word left is “JILID” (a rare spelling variant) or “WILID” (not a word).  Actually, the only recognizable word that fits is **BLIND** but B, N, D are ruled out.  

Looking again at the letters D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z, the only valid 5-letter English word I can construct that contains both L and I is:

- **WILID** – not valid
- **JILID** – not common
- **LIVID** – contains V, I, D, L (D is allowed still).  LIVID is a real word.

Let me check LIVID:
- Letters L, I, V, I, D  
- All letters are in the allowed set (D, V, L, I).  
- Contains both required letters L and I.  
- I appears in positions 2 and 4, but we know position 4 cannot be I (from Guess 4).  LIVID has I in positions 2 and 4, so it violates the “I not in position 4” rule.

Next possibility: **DIVIL** – but again I would be in position 4.

**LIVID** and **DIVIL** are invalid because they place I in position 4.

Next try: **WILDL** – not a word.

**JILDL** – not a word.

The only 5-letter word that fits is “WILDL” (invalid) or “WILDI” (not a word).

Realizing that **D** is still allowed, and letters left are D, J, L, I, Q, V, W, X, Z, the only valid English word is **LIVID** but that puts I in position 4.  Therefore, there must be another pattern.

Wait – the word **LIVID** is 5 letters, but the I’s are in positions 2 and 4.  Since position 4 cannot be I, this is impossible.

Another try: **WILDI** – again I in position 4.

**DILLY** – Y is ruled out.

**WILLY** – Y ruled out.

**WILDL** – invalid.

**JILDL** – invalid.

**JILLY** – Y ruled out.

**VILDI** – I in position 4.

**VIDLI** – I in position 5, but not a word.

**VILLI** – 5-letter word, uses V, I, L, L, I – all allowed letters.  Positions:
V I L L I  
- I is in positions 2 and 5, never position 4 – satisfies all constraints.  
- Contains L (positions 3,4) and I (positions 2,5).  
- All letters are from the permitted set.

Thus, **VILLI** is a valid guess.

Therefore, the next logical guess is VILLI.",Guess 6: VILLI -> FEEDBACK: V(-) I(✓) L(-) L(-) I(-),FAIL
