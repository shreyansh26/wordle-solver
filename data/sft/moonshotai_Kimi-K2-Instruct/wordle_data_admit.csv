For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some top choices for first guesses based on letter frequency and position analysis are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters (C, R, N), vowels (A, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

1. Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E.

3. We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants not yet tried (S, T, L, B, M, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- Place A in a different position.  
- Include other high-frequency letters (S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

A balanced choice is “SALTY”: it contains A (now in 2nd position), plus new letters S, L, T, Y. This tests five fresh letters and moves A away from the 2nd slot.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE  
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)  
→ Additional letters eliminated: S, L, Y  
→ Letter A is still present but NOT in position 2 (confirmed above) and now also NOT in position 1.  
→ Letter T exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere): A, T  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for A: 1, 2  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for T: 4  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tried: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and T.  
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).  
3. Places T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is ruled out).  
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate word that satisfies these rules: “MATHS”  
- M, H are new letters.  
- A is in position 2 → wait, position 2 for A is ruled out.  
Next candidate: “ADOPT” → O, P, D are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAPAS” → S is eliminated.  
Next: “ABOUT” → B and O and U are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAMPA” → P is new; A is in positions 2 and 5 → position 2 ruled out.  
Next: “GLOAT” → G, O are new; A is in 4 (allowed); T is in 5 (allowed). This works.

Check GLOAT:
- Letters: G, L, O, A, T  
- L was eliminated in SALTY → whoops, L is out.

Next: “PATIO” → P, I, O new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “KAPUT” → K, P, U new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “TABOO” → O, B new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “HASTA” → H new; S, L already eliminated, A in 2 → ruled out.

A, T (must be present), plus allowed letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

A not in 1 or 2.  
T not in 4.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some top choices for first guesses based on letter frequency and position analysis are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters (C, R, N), vowels (A, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.  
- R(x) – R is not in the word.  
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
- N(x) – N is not in the word.  
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Key deductions:
1. Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E.  
2. Letter confirmed present but misplaced: A, and it cannot be in slot 2.  
3. We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants not yet tried (S, T, L, B, M, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- Place A in a different position.  
- Include other high-frequency letters (S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

A balanced choice is “SALTY”: it contains A (now in 2nd position), plus new letters S, L, T, Y. This tests five fresh letters and moves A away from the 2nd slot.

<guess>SALTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE  
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
→ Letters eliminated so far: C, R, N, E  
→ Letter A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.

Guess 2: SALTY  
S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)  
→ Additional letters eliminated: S, L, Y  
→ Letter A is still present but NOT in position 2 (confirmed above) and now also NOT in position 1.  
→ Letter T exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere): A, T  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for A: 1, 2  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for T: 4  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tried: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and T.  
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).  
3. Places T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is ruled out).  
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate word that satisfies these rules: “MATHS”  
- M, H are new letters.  
- A is in position 2 → wait, position 2 for A is ruled out.  
Next candidate: “ADOPT” → O, P, D are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAPAS” → S is eliminated.  
Next: “ABOUT” → B and O and U are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAMPA” → P is new; A is in positions 2 and 5 → position 2 ruled out.  
Next: “GLOAT” → G, O are new; A is in 4 (allowed); T is in 5 (allowed). This works.

Check GLOAT:
- Letters: G, L, O, A, T  
- L was eliminated in SALTY → whoops, L is out.  

Next: “COATI” → C is eliminated.  
Next: “PATIO” → P, I, O new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “KAPUT” → K, P, U new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “TABOO” → O, B new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “HASTA” → H new; S, L already eliminated, A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “TALON” → L, N eliminated.  

Let’s list all remaining letters not eliminated:
A, T (must be present), plus allowed letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

Word must contain A and T, avoid positions:
A not in 1 or 2.  
T not in 4.

Let’s pick A in 3 and T in 1: “TA_M_”  
A in 3, T in 1 → “TA???”  
We need three more letters not eliminated, avoiding any eliminated ones.  
Example: “TAHOG” – but not a recognized word.  
Real word: “TAHOS” – S eliminated.  
Real word: “TAHOU” – not common.  
Real word: “TABOR” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TABUN” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TACET” – C, E eliminated.  
Real word: “TADPO” – not a word.  
Real word: “TAGMA” – not common.  
Real word: “TALUK” – L eliminated.  
Real word: “TAMBO” – not a word.  
Real word: “TANGA” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAPIR” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TAPIS” – S eliminated.  
Real word: “TARDI” – not a word.  
Real word: “TAROK” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TAROT” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TATOU” – not common.  
Real word: “TAUNT” – U, N new; N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAUON” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAXON” – N, X new; N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAHOE” – E eliminated.  

Let’s try A in 4 and T in 1: “T__A_”  
Word: “THANK” – N eliminated.  
Word: “THAWK” – not a word.  
Word: “THARM” – not a word.  
Word: “THAWY” – not a word.  
Word: “THIAB” – not a word.  
Word: “TIDAL” – L eliminated.  
Word: “TIKAL” – L eliminated.  
Word: “TIMBA” – not a word.  
Word: “TITAN” – N eliminated.  
Word: “TOGAE” – E eliminated.  
Word: “TOKAY” – Y eliminated.  
Word: “TOPIA” – P, I, O new; A in 5 (allowed); T in 1 (allowed).  
“TOPIA” is a word (variant spelling of topia).

Check letters: T, O, P, I, A  
All are allowed (no eliminated letters), and it satisfies:
- Contains A (position 5) and T (position 1).  
- A not in 1 or 2.  
- T not in 4.

Therefore, TOPIA is a valid next guess.

Summary of constraints  
- Letters that must appear: A, T, I  
  – I is fixed in position 4  
- Position restrictions  
  – A cannot be in 2 or 5  
  – T cannot be in 1 or 4  
- Letters already eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, O, P  
- Remaining legal letters (alphabetically):  
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, T, I)

Current word skeleton (underscore = unknown):  
_ _ _ I _

We need three more letters from the allowed set, with A and T placed somewhere legal.

1. A can only be in positions 1 or 3.  
2. T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).

Let’s consider the two possible placements of A:

Case 1: A in position 1  
A _ _ I _  
– T must go in 2, 3, or 5  
  – T in 2: A T _ I _  → need two more letters (positions 3,5)  
  – T in 3: A _ T I _  → need two more letters (positions 2,5)  
  – T in 5: A _ _ I T  → need two more letters (positions 2,3)

Case 2: A in position 3  
_ _ A I _  
– T must go in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 3 because A is there, and cannot be in 4)  
  – T in 2: _ T A I _  → need two more letters (positions 1,5)  
  – T in 5: _ _ A I T  → need two more letters (positions 1,2)

We now look for common 5-letter English words that fit one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

- Case 1: A _ _ I T  
  Try common consonants:  
  A D I T?  Not a word.  
  A F I T?  Not a word.  
  A M I T?  “AMBIT” – valid word, letters A, M, B, I, T all allowed.

- Case 2: _ T A I _  
  Possible words: “UTAIA” (non-word), “FTAIN” (non-word), “VTAIL” (non-word). None common.

- Case 2: _ _ A I T  
  Try: “BRAIT” – B, R, A, I, T – but R eliminated.  
  “DUAIT” – not a word.  
  “GHAIT” – not a word.  
  No clear common word found quickly.

Therefore, the only common valid word that fits all constraints is AMBIT.

Check AMBIT:  
Letters: A, M, B, I, T  
- All letters are in the allowed set.  
- A is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (fixed).  
- T is in position 5 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

Hence, AMBIT is a safe, rule-compliant next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some top choices for first guesses based on letter frequency and position analysis are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters (C, R, N), vowels (A, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.  
- R(x) – R is not in the word.  
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
- N(x) – N is not in the word.  
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Key deductions:
1. Letters eliminated: C, R, N, E.  
2. Letter confirmed present but misplaced: A, and it cannot be in slot 2.  
3. We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants not yet tried (S, T, L, B, M, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- Place A in a different position.  
- Include other high-frequency letters (S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

A balanced choice is “SALTY”: it contains A (now in 2nd position), plus new letters S, L, T, Y. This tests five fresh letters and moves A away from the 2nd slot.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE  
C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
→ Letters eliminated so far: C, R, N, E  
→ Letter A exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.

Guess 2: SALTY  
S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)  
→ Additional letters eliminated: S, L, Y  
→ Letter A is still present but NOT in position 2 (confirmed above) and now also NOT in position 1.  
→ Letter T exists somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere): A, T  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for A: 1, 2  
- Confirmed positions to avoid for T: 4  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tried: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and T.  
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).  
3. Places T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 is ruled out).  
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate word that satisfies these rules: “MATHS”  
- M, H are new letters.  
- A is in position 2 → wait, position 2 for A is ruled out.  
Next candidate: “ADOPT” → O, P, D are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAPAS” → S is eliminated.  
Next: “ABOUT” → B and O and U are new; A is in position 1 → ruled out.  
Next: “TAMPA” → P is new; A is in positions 2 and 5 → position 2 ruled out.  
Next: “GLOAT” → G, O are new; A is in 4 (allowed); T is in 5 (allowed). This works.

Check GLOAT:
- Letters: G, L, O, A, T  
- L was eliminated in SALTY → whoops, L is out.  

Next: “COATI” → C is eliminated.  
Next: “PATIO” → P, I, O new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “KAPUT” → K, P, U new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “TABOO” → O, B new; A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “HASTA” → H new; S, L already eliminated, A in 2 → ruled out.  
Next: “TALON” → L, N eliminated.  

Let’s list all remaining letters not eliminated:
A, T (must be present), plus allowed letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, B, F, etc.

Word must contain A and T, avoid positions:
A not in 1 or 2.  
T not in 4.

Let’s pick A in 3 and T in 1: “TA_M_”  
A in 3, T in 1 → “TA???”  
We need three more letters not eliminated, avoiding any eliminated ones.  
Example: “TAHOG” – but not a recognized word.  
Real word: “TAHOS” – S eliminated.  
Real word: “TAHOU” – not common.  
Real word: “TABOR” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TABUN” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TACET” – C, E eliminated.  
Real word: “TADPO” – not a word.  
Real word: “TAGMA” – not common.  
Real word: “TALUK” – L eliminated.  
Real word: “TAMBO” – not a word.  
Real word: “TANGA” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAPIR” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TAPIS” – S eliminated.  
Real word: “TARDI” – not a word.  
Real word: “TAROK” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TAROT” – R eliminated.  
Real word: “TATOU” – not common.  
Real word: “TAUNT” – U, N new; N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAUON” – N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAXON” – N, X new; N eliminated.  
Real word: “TAHOE” – E eliminated.  

Let’s try A in 4 and T in 1: “T__A_”  
Word: “THANK” – N eliminated.  
Word: “THAWK” – not a word.  
Word: “THARM” – not a word.  
Word: “THAWY” – not a word.  
Word: “THIAB” – not a word.  
Word: “TIDAL” – L eliminated.  
Word: “TIKAL” – L eliminated.  
Word: “TIMBA” – not a word.  
Word: “TITAN” – N eliminated.  
Word: “TOGAE” – E eliminated.  
Word: “TOKAY” – Y eliminated.  
Word: “TOPIA” – P, I, O new; A in 5 (allowed); T in 1 (allowed).  
“TOPIA” is a word (variant spelling of topia).

Check letters: T, O, P, I, A  
All are allowed (no eliminated letters), and it satisfies:
- Contains A (position 5) and T (position 1).  
- A not in 1 or 2.  
- T not in 4.

Therefore, TOPIA is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: TOPIA -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) P(x) I(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update everything we now know after the three guesses:

Guesses and feedback  
1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   – Eliminated: C, R, N, E  
   – A exists but not in position 2  

2. SALTY → S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)  
   – Eliminated: S, L, Y  
   – T exists but not in position 4  

3. TOPIA → T(-) O(x) P(x) I(✓) A(-)  
   – Eliminated: O, P  
   – I is correct in position 4  
   – T exists but not in position 1  
   – A exists but not in position 5  

Summary of constraints  
- Letters that must appear: A, T, I  
  – I is fixed in position 4  
- Position restrictions  
  – A cannot be in 2 or 5  
  – T cannot be in 1 or 4  
- Letters already eliminated: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, O, P  
- Remaining legal letters (alphabetically):  
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, T, I)

Current word skeleton (underscore = unknown):  
_ _ _ I _

We need three more letters from the allowed set, with A and T placed somewhere legal.

1. A can only be in positions 1 or 3.  
2. T can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).

Let’s consider the two possible placements of A:

Case 1: A in position 1  
A _ _ I _  
– T must go in 2, 3, or 5  
  – T in 2: A T _ I _  → need two more letters (positions 3,5)  
  – T in 3: A _ T I _  → need two more letters (positions 2,5)  
  – T in 5: A _ _ I T  → need two more letters (positions 2,3)

Case 2: A in position 3  
_ _ A I _  
– T must go in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 3 because A is there, and cannot be in 4)  
  – T in 2: _ T A I _  → need two more letters (positions 1,5)  
  – T in 5: _ _ A I T  → need two more letters (positions 1,2)

We now look for common 5-letter English words that fit one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

- Case 1: A _ _ I T  
  Try common consonants:  
  A D I T?  Not a word.  
  A F I T?  Not a word.  
  A M I T?  “AMBIT” – valid word, letters A, M, B, I, T all allowed.

- Case 2: _ T A I _  
  Possible words: “UTAIA” (non-word), “FTAIN” (non-word), “VTAIL” (non-word). None common.

- Case 2: _ _ A I T  
  Try: “BRAIT” – B, R, A, I, T – but R eliminated.  
  “DUAIT” – not a word.  
  “GHAIT” – not a word.  
  No clear common word found quickly.

Therefore, the only common valid word that fits all constraints is AMBIT.

Check AMBIT:  
Letters: A, M, B, I, T  
- All letters are in the allowed set.  
- A is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 4 (fixed).  
- T is in position 5 (allowed).  
- No eliminated letters appear.

Hence, AMBIT is a safe, rule-compliant next guess.

B(x) – B is not in the word.  
I(✓) – I is fixed in position 4.

So we now know the secret word must be of the form:

A _ _ I T

with the additional constraint that M must appear somewhere in the remaining two slots (positions 2 or 3), and no other letters from the eliminated list may be used.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, O, P, B.

Allowed remaining consonants for positions 2 and 3: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus the required M.

Because M must appear at least once, it must occupy either position 2 or position 3. The other position must be filled with one of the allowed letters.

Let’s list the two possible patterns:

1. A M _ I T → Need one consonant in position 3.  
   Candidates: AMDIT (invalid, D is fine but word not common), AMGIT (invalid), AMHIT (invalid)…  
   Real word: ADMIT – but M is not in position 2. We need M in position 2 here, so AM _ I T must be AM D I T, AM G I T, etc. The only common word fitting is AMDIT? No.  
   Actually, AM D I T is not a valid word, nor is AM G I T, so this pattern yields nothing common.

2. A _ M I T → Need one consonant in position 2.  
   Candidates: A D M I T → ADMIT – real word, letters all allowed (A, D, M, I, T), and M is in position 3, satisfying the M(-) clue.

Thus the only common word that fits all constraints is ADMIT.
