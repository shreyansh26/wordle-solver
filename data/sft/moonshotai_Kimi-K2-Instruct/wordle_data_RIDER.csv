For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify the presence of multiple vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at these criteria, words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- E is NOT in the 5th position

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not use S, L, A, T
2. Uses E somewhere other than the 5th position
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, H, K
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since we already know E is present)

A balanced word could be ""REIGN"" because:
- Uses R, E, I, G, N
- Places E in position 2 (not the last position)
- Uses common letters

Another option is ""CHIEF"" but F is less common. ""PRONE"" uses O and N but repeats no letters. ""DINER"" uses I, N, D, R and places E in the 4th position.

""REIGN"" seems like a strong choice for the second guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify the presence of multiple vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at these criteria, words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- E is NOT in the 5th position

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not use S, L, A, T
2. Uses E somewhere other than the 5th position
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, H, K
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since we already know E is present)

A balanced word could be ""REIGN"" because:
- Uses R, E, I, G, N
- Places E in position 2 (not the last position)
- Uses common letters

Another option is ""CHIEF"" but F is less common. ""PRONE"" uses O and N but repeats no letters. ""DINER"" uses I, N, D, R and places E in the 4th position.

""REIGN"" seems like a strong choice for the second guess.

Guess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, G, N  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: R, E
- R is in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (eliminated by previous guesses).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 4 (only remaining slot).
- Word structure so far: R _ _ E _

Valid remaining letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, O, U (I already tried in position 3 and it got “-” (wrong position), so I can still use I, but not in position 3. O and U are still fully available.)

Popular/common still-available letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, I, O, U

We need two more consonants (or consonant + vowel) for positions 2 and 3, plus one more letter for position 5.

To maximize information, pick a word that uses several new common letters.  
Candidate: “R I D E R” – but R repeats.  
Candidate: “R I D E O” – uses I, D, O.  
Candidate: “R U D E R” – repeats R.  
Candidate: “R U B E D” – uses U, B, D.  
Candidate: “R O C K E” – but E is fixed in 4th.  

Best option seems “R U B E D” – all new letters except R and E, no repeats, good spread.

But we can do slightly better with “R I P E D” – uses I, P, D.

What we now know:

1. Word structure: R I _ E _
2. Letters already fixed in place: R (1st), I (2nd), E (4th)
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   S, L, A, T, G, N, P, D, C, Y  
   (plus any letter never tried, but we can ignore those)
4. Remaining alphabet letters that have **not** been ruled out and are still candidates for positions 3 and 5:
   B, F, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Z  
   (and of course we cannot reuse any of the ruled-out letters)

5. We need a real 5-letter English word that starts with “RI” and ends with “E_”, and whose 3rd and 5th letters come only from the still-allowed set.

Creating the candidate list:

- R I B E _  →  R I B E L (L ruled out), R I B E S (S ruled out), R I B E T (T ruled out) … none valid.
- R I F E _  →  R I F E R (R repeats), R I F E D (D ruled out) … no valid word.
- R I H E _  →  no common word
- R I K E _  →  R I K E Y (but Y already ruled out)
- R I M E _  →  R I M E S (S ruled out), R I M E D (D ruled out)
- R I O E _  →  no standard word
- R I U E _  →  no standard word
- R I V E _  →  R I V E R (R repeats), R I V E T (T ruled out)
- R I W E _  →  no standard word
- R I X E _  →  no standard word
- R I Z E _  →  no standard word
- R I _ E O  →  R I V E O (not a word), R I M E O (not a word)

After checking standard English 5-letter dictionaries, the only **common** valid word left that fits R I _ E _ and avoids every banned letter is:

R I M E R   →  but R repeats (and R already used in 1st position) – invalid.

R I B E T   →  T banned.

R I V E R   →  R repeats.

R I V E T   →  T banned.

R I M E D   →  D banned.

R I K E R   →  R repeats.

R I M E S   →  S banned.

R I M E X   →  not common.

R I V E X   →  not a word.

R I M E Z   →  not a word.

Wait – the only still-valid English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is:

R I M E R – but duplicate R (invalid).

Actually, let me re-examine:

“RIMER” (a real word meaning one that rimes) – allows M and R, but again R repeats.

“RIMED” – D banned.

“RIVED” – D banned.

“RIPEY” – Y banned; P banned.

“RILED” – L and D banned.

It appears that **every dictionary word** fitting R I _ E _ uses at least one forbidden letter or repeats R.  
That indicates an earlier assumption must be wrong: maybe the 2nd letter **is not I**.  
But feedback gave I a ✓ in position 2, so I is definitely correct.

Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the 3rd letter is **M** and the 5th must be one of the **still-allowed** letters.  
Re-examine the still-allowed letters for position 5:

Letters not yet tested and still valid: B, F, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Z  
(no C, Y, etc.)

Scanning the dictionary for R I M E ? with ? from that set:

- R I M E B  – not a word  
- R I M E F  – not a word  
- R I M E H  – not a word  
- R I M E K  – not a word  
- R I M E M  – repeats M, invalid  
- R I M E O  – not a word  
- R I M E U  – not a word  
- R I M E V  – not a word  
- R I M E W  – not a word  
- R I M E X  – not a word  
- R I M E Z  – not a word  

This exhaustive check shows no valid common English word that starts with R I _ E _ given the banned letters.  
Hence the **only possible 5th character that is still legal** and yields a known word is actually **B**, forming:

R I M E B  – but that is not a recognized word.

Rechecking the ruled-out list: I had “B” as still legal.  
Let me try again with **B** in position 5:

R I M E B – indeed, “RIMEB” does not exist.

So the true legal remaining word is **R I M E R**, even though it repeats R – but the feedback so far **does not forbid** repeating a letter that is already confirmed in position 1.  
The feedback only marks duplicates as “wrong position” if they exceed the count in the secret word, and we have no evidence yet that the secret word has only one R.

Therefore the safest next valid guess is:

R I M E R

<guess>RIMER</guess>",RIMER,"What we now know:

1. Word structure: R I _ E _
2. Letters already fixed in place: R (1st), I (2nd), E (4th)
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   S, L, A, T, G, N, P, D, C, Y  
   (plus any letter never tried, but we can ignore those)
4. Remaining alphabet letters that have **not** been ruled out and are still candidates for positions 3 and 5:
   B, F, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Z  
   (and of course we cannot reuse any of the ruled-out letters)

5. We need a real 5-letter English word that starts with “RI” and ends with “E_”, and whose 3rd and 5th letters come only from the still-allowed set.

Creating the candidate list:

- R I B E _  →  R I B E L (L ruled out), R I B E S (S ruled out), R I B E T (T ruled out) … none valid.
- R I F E _  →  R I F E R (R repeats), R I F E D (D ruled out) … no valid word.
- R I H E _  →  no common word
- R I K E _  →  R I K E Y (but Y already ruled out)
- R I M E _  →  R I M E S (S ruled out), R I M E D (D ruled out)
- R I O E _  →  no standard word
- R I U E _  →  no standard word
- R I V E _  →  R I V E R (R repeats), R I V E T (T ruled out)
- R I W E _  →  no standard word
- R I X E _  →  no standard word
- R I Z E _  →  no standard word
- R I _ E O  →  R I V E O (not a word), R I M E O (not a word)

After checking standard English 5-letter dictionaries, the only **common** valid word left that fits R I _ E _ and avoids every banned letter is:

R I M E R   →  but R repeats (and R already used in 1st position) – invalid.

R I B E T   →  T banned.

R I V E R   →  R repeats.

R I V E T   →  T banned.

R I M E D   →  D banned.

R I K E R   →  R repeats.

R I M E S   →  S banned.

R I M E X   →  not common.

R I V E X   →  not a word.

R I M E Z   →  not a word.

Wait – the only still-valid English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is:

R I M E R – but duplicate R (invalid).

Actually, let me re-examine:

“RIMER” (a real word meaning one that rimes) – allows M and R, but again R repeats.

“RIMED” – D banned.

“RIVED” – D banned.

“RIPEY” – Y banned; P banned.

“RILED” – L and D banned.

It appears that **every dictionary word** fitting R I _ E _ uses at least one forbidden letter or repeats R.  
That indicates an earlier assumption must be wrong: maybe the 2nd letter **is not I**.  
But feedback gave I a ✓ in position 2, so I is definitely correct.

Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the 3rd letter is **M** and the 5th must be one of the **still-allowed** letters.  
Re-examine the still-allowed letters for position 5:

Letters not yet tested and still valid: B, F, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Z  
(no C, Y, etc.)

Scanning the dictionary for R I M E ? with ? from that set:

- R I M E B  – not a word  
- R I M E F  – not a word  
- R I M E H  – not a word  
- R I M E K  – not a word  
- R I M E M  – repeats M, invalid  
- R I M E O  – not a word  
- R I M E U  – not a word  
- R I M E V  – not a word  
- R I M E W  – not a word  
- R I M E X  – not a word  
- R I M E Z  – not a word  

This exhaustive check shows no valid common English word that starts with R I _ E _ given the banned letters.  
Hence the **only possible 5th character that is still legal** and yields a known word is actually **B**, forming:

R I M E B  – but that is not a recognized word.

Rechecking the ruled-out list: I had “B” as still legal.  
Let me try again with **B** in position 5:

R I M E B – indeed, “RIMEB” does not exist.

So the true legal remaining word is **R I M E R**, even though it repeats R – but the feedback so far **does not forbid** repeating a letter that is already confirmed in position 1.  
The feedback only marks duplicates as “wrong position” if they exceed the count in the secret word, and we have no evidence yet that the secret word has only one R.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,RIDER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify the presence of multiple vowels and consonants. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at these criteria, words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- E is NOT in the 5th position

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not use S, L, A, T
2. Uses E somewhere other than the 5th position
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, H, K
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since we already know E is present)

A balanced word could be ""REIGN"" because:
- Uses R, E, I, G, N
- Places E in position 2 (not the last position)
- Uses common letters

Another option is ""CHIEF"" but F is less common. ""PRONE"" uses O and N but repeats no letters. ""DINER"" uses I, N, D, R and places E in the 4th position.

""REIGN"" seems like a strong choice for the second guess.

<guess>REIGN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, G, N  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: R, E
- R is in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (eliminated by previous guesses).

Therefore:
- E must be in position 4 (only remaining slot).
- Word structure so far: R _ _ E _

Valid remaining letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, O, U (I already tried in position 3 and it got “-” (wrong position), so I can still use I, but not in position 3. O and U are still fully available.)

Popular/common still-available letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, I, O, U

We need two more consonants (or consonant + vowel) for positions 2 and 3, plus one more letter for position 5.

To maximize information, pick a word that uses several new common letters.  
Candidate: “R I D E R” – but R repeats.  
Candidate: “R I D E O” – uses I, D, O.  
Candidate: “R U D E R” – repeats R.  
Candidate: “R U B E D” – uses U, B, D.  
Candidate: “R O C K E” – but E is fixed in 4th.  

Best option seems “R U B E D” – all new letters except R and E, no repeats, good spread.

But we can do slightly better with “R I P E D” – uses I, P, D.

Let’s choose “R I P E D”.

Guess 3: RIPED -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now have:

- R ✓, I ✓, E ✓ are all in their correct positions (1, 2, 4 respectively).
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, G, N, P, D.

Needed:
- 3rd and 5th letters.
- Remaining usable letters (not yet ruled out):
  Consonants: B, C, F, H, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Vowels: O, U (I and E are already placed)

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form: R I _ E _

Common letters still available: B, C, F, H, K, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- R I B E ?
  R I B E R – but R repeats.
  R I B E L – L is ruled out.
  R I B E N – N ruled out.
  R I B E D – D ruled out.
  None valid.

- R I C E ?
  R I C E R – R repeats.
  R I C E D – D ruled out.
  R I C E S – S ruled out.
  R I C E Y – R I C E Y is valid.

- R I M E ?
  R I M E O – valid but O is less common.
  R I M E D – D ruled out.
  R I M E S – S ruled out.

- R I V E ?
  R I V E T – T ruled out.
  R I V E R – R repeats.

- R I K E ?
  R I K E D – D ruled out.
  R I K E Y – R I K E Y is valid.

- R I C E Y vs R I K E Y – both are valid English words.
  Between them, C is more common than K, so R I C E Y is a slightly better choice.

We need a real 5-letter English word that starts with “RI” and ends with “E_”, and whose 3rd and 5th letters come only from the still-allowed set.\n\nCreating the candidate list:\n\n- R I B E _  →  R I B E L (L ruled out), R I B E S (S ruled out), R I B E T (T ruled out) … none valid.\n- R I F E _  →  R I F E R (R repeats), R I F E D (D ruled out) … no valid word.\n- R I H E _  →  no common word\n- R I K E _  →  R I K E Y (but Y already ruled out)\n- R I M E _  →  R I M E S (S ruled out), R I M E D (D ruled out)\n- R I O E _  →  no standard word\n- R I U E _  →  no standard word\n- R I V E _  →  R I V E R (R repeats), R I V E T (T ruled out)\n- R I W E _  →  no standard word\n- R I X E _  →  no standard word\n- R I Z E _  →  no standard word\n- R I _ E O  →  R I V E O (not a word), R I M E O (not a word)\n\nAfter checking standard English 5-letter dictionaries, the only **common** valid word left that fits R I _ E _ and avoids every banned letter is:\n\nR I M E R   →  but R repeats (and R already used in 1st position) – invalid.\n\nR I B E T   →  T banned.\n\nR I V E R   →  R repeats.\n\nR I V E T   →  T banned.\n\nR I M E D   →  D banned.\n\nR I K E R   →  R repeats.\n\nR I M E S   →  S banned.\n\nR I M E X   →  not common.\n\nR I V E X   →  not a word.\n\nR I M E Z   →  not a word.\n\nWait – the only still-valid English word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is:\n\nR I M E R – but duplicate R (invalid).\n\nActually, let me re-examine:\n\n“RIMER” (a real word meaning one that rimes) – allows M and R, but again R repeats.\n\n“RIMED” – D banned.\n\n“RIVED” – D banned.\n\n“RIPEY” – Y banned; P banned.\n\n“RILED” – L and D banned.\n\nIt appears that **every dictionary word** fitting R I _ E _ uses at least one forbidden letter or repeats R.  \nThat indicates an earlier assumption must be wrong: maybe the 2nd letter **is not I**.  \nBut feedback gave I a ✓ in position 2, so I is definitely correct.\n\nTherefore the only remaining possibility is that the 3rd letter is **M** and the 5th must be one of the **still-allowed** letters.  \nRe-examine the still-allowed letters for position 5:\n\nLetters not yet tested and still valid: B, F, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, X, Z  \n(no C, Y, etc.)\n\nScanning the dictionary for R I M E ? with ? from that set:\n\n- R I M E B  – not a word  \n- R I M E F  – not a word  \n- R I M E H  – not a word  \n- R I M E K  – not a word  \n- R I M E M  – repeats M, invalid  \n- R I M E O  – not a word  \n- R I M E U  – not a word  \n- R I M E V  – not a word  \n- R I M E W  – not a word  \n- R I M E X  – not a word  \n- R I M E Z  – not a word  \n\nThis exhaustive check shows no valid common English word that starts with R I _ E _ given the banned letters.  \nHence the **only possible 5th character that is still legal** and yields a known word is actually **B**, forming:\n\nR I M E B  – but that is not a recognized word.\n\nRechecking the ruled-out list: I had “B” as still legal.  \nLet me try again with **B** in position 5:\n\nR I M E B – indeed, “RIMEB” does not exist.\n\nSo the true legal remaining word is **R I M E R**, even though it repeats R – but the feedback so far **does not forbid** repeating a letter that is already confirmed in position 1.  \nThe feedback only marks duplicates as “wrong position” if they exceed the count in the secret word, and we have no evidence yet that the secret word has only one R.\n\nTherefore the safest next valid guess is:\n\nR I M E R\n\n<guess>RIMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: RIPED -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 4: RICEY -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) C(x) E(✓) Y(x)\nGuess 5: RIMER -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now know:

1. Word structure: R I _ E R
   - R is fixed in positions 1 and 5 → so the secret word ends in R and has an R at the start.
2. Letters already fixed in place: R (1st), I (2nd), E (4th), R (5th)
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, G, N, P, D, C, Y, M

So the only slot still open is position 3.  
The remaining alphabet letters that have **not** been ruled out are:  
B, F, H, K, O, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a common 5-letter English word that starts with R I _ E R and whose 3rd letter is taken only from that allowed set.

Candidate list:

- R I B E R   → “RIBER” (plural of “ribe”, archaic, not common)
- R I F E R   → “RIFER” (comparative of “rife”, but Wordle accepts it)
- R I H E R   → not a word
- R I K E R   → “RIKER” (surname, Wordle accepts)
- R I O E R   → not a word
- R I U E R   → not a word
- R I V E R   → “RIVER” (but V is still allowed, and it’s a common word)
- R I W E R   → not a word
- R I X E R   → not a word
- R I Z E R   → not a word

Among these, “RIVER” is the most common and standard word, and the letter V has **not** been ruled out yet.

Hence, the next logical guess is “RIVER”.
