For the first guess, I need to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. After considering various options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, and E. These letters are among the most frequently used in English and cover a good range of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly determine which letters are present and potentially their positions in the secret word.

The feedback from the first guess (arose) tells me:
- A, R, S, and E are NOT in the secret word (each marked with x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Since O is in the word but not in the 3rd position, it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (since it's confirmed to be in the word).
2. Does NOT include A, R, S, or E (since they're not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common letters remaining (and excluding A, R, S, E), good candidates are T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc. A word like ""POINT"" might seem good, but it contains I and N (which are good), but also N and T. However, ""POINT"" has P, which is less common but still valid. Alternatively, ""OLIVE"" uses O in a new position (1st), and includes L, I, V, E—but E is already eliminated. 

A better choice is ""TOUCH"" because:
- T, O, U, C, H are all common letters not yet eliminated.
- O is in a new position (2nd) to test if it belongs there.
- Covers consonants T and C, and vowels O and U.

But ""TOUCH"" has U and H, which are decent. Another option is ""DOUGH"" but that's less ideal. ""MOUNT"" uses M, O, U, N, T—all good letters. 

""POINT"" seems slightly better because:
- O is in position 2 (new).
- P, I, N, T are all new letters to test.
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, E) are used.

I'll go with ""POINT"" as it balances common letters and new positions for O.

Let’s carefully re-examine the feedback so far.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A, R, S, E are not in the word.
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. point → P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
   – P is correct in position 1.
   – O is correct in position 2 (so O is now locked into position 2).
   – N is correct in position 4.
   – I and T are not in the word.

3. pylon → P(✓) Y(x) L(x) O(-) N(-)
   – P still correct in position 1.
   – Y and L are not in the word.
   – O shows “-” (in word, wrong place). But from “point” we already know O is in position 2, so O must actually be in position 2. The “O(-)” here must be interpreted as “O is in the word but not in position 4” – which is consistent with O in position 2.
   – N shows “-” (in word, wrong place). But from “point” we already know N is in position 4. So the “N(-)” must mean “N is in the word but not in position 5” – also consistent.

Therefore we now know the pattern is:
P _ O N _ 
and the letters we have already ruled out are:
A, E, I, R, S, T, Y, L

We need a valid 5-letter word matching P ? O N ? where the second and fifth letters are NOT any of the eliminated letters.

List of possible letters not yet eliminated (common consonants and vowels): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Possible second letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W…
Possible fifth letters: same pool.

- P I O N ? – I is already eliminated.
- P U O N G – PUONG – not valid.
- P C O N Y – PCONY – not valid.
- P H O N Y – PHONY – “PHONY” is an actual word!  
  – Positions: P(1) H(2) O(3) N(4) Y(5).  
  – But Y was eliminated by pylon, so Y is invalid.

- P D O N K – PDONK – not valid.
- P F O N K – PFONK – not valid.
- P H O N K – PHONK – PHONK is a valid informal word (from “honk”).

Let’s double-check:
- PHONK: P ✓, H ?, O ✓, N ✓, K ?
  – Letters used: P, H, O, N, K.
  – Eliminated letters (A, E, I, R, S, T, Y, L) – none of these are in PHONK.

Therefore PHONK is a valid candidate.

Another quick check: any other common words?
- PFUNK – not valid.

- PWING – doesn’t fit P_ O N _.

So PHONK looks like the only plausible remaining word that satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from the first guess (arose) tells me:
- A, R, S, and E are NOT in the secret word (each marked with x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with -).

Since O is in the word but not in the 3rd position, it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (since it's confirmed to be in the word).
2. Does NOT include A, R, S, or E (since they're not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

However, ""POINT"" has P, which is less common but still valid. Alternatively, ""OLIVE"" uses O in a new position (1st), and includes L, I, V, E—but E is already eliminated. 

A better choice is ""TOUCH"" because:

- O is in a new position (2nd) to test if it belongs there.
- Covers consonants T and C, and vowels O and U.

But ""TOUCH"" has U and H, which are decent. Another option is ""DOUGH"" but that's less ideal. ""MOUNT"" uses M, O, U, N, T—all good letters. 

""POINT"" seems slightly better because:
- O is in position 2 (new).
- P, I, N, T are all new letters to test.
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, E) are used.

I'll go with ""POINT"" as it balances common letters and new positions for O.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters that have not been eliminated. Good remaining common letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Position 2 (second letter) must be one of these. Position 5 (last letter) also must be one, and must combine well with the rest.

- PIONE (not valid)
- POXON (not valid)
- PRONG (but R is eliminated)
- PLONG (not common)
- PYONS (not common)
- PZONK (invalid)

Looking more systematically: P _ O N _
Common patterns: P, consonant, O, N, consonant OR sometimes vowel.

Looking at valid words:
- Pylon (but Y and L)
- Picon (no c in position 2, but P I C O N - I is eliminated)
- Pogon (but G and O already used)
- Pylon - Y and L are available, and it's a valid word.

""PYLON"" uses:
- P, O, N in correct positions.
- Y and L which haven't been eliminated.
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, E, I, T).

Let me carefully update what the feedback now tells us.

From guess 2 (point) we already locked:
- P at position 1
- O at position 2
- N at position 4

From guess 4 (phonk) we additionally learn:
- H is NOT in the word (x)
- K is NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern is exactly:
P O _ N _
and the letters we have explicitly ruled out so far are:
A, E, I, R, S, T, Y, L, H, K

Valid letters left (common ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, U, V, W, Z.

Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with PO, has N at position 4, and uses only the remaining letters.

Examining real words:
- POUND – uses U and D (both allowed)
- PONGY – uses Y which is eliminated
- PONCE – uses C and E; E is eliminated
- PONGE – uses G and E; E is eliminated
- PONCY – C is allowed, Y is not
- PONGE – same issue
- PONDA – A is eliminated
- PONKU – not a recognized word
- PONDO – O is already in position 2
- PONGE – again E is out
- PONFU – not existing
- PONVA – A is out
- PONGE – still has E
- PONCY – Y is out
- PONCE – E is out
- PONGE – E is out
- PONKU – not valid
- PONDO – O is already used correctly
- PONGE – E is out
- PONFU – not valid
- PONMU – not valid
- PONVA – A is out
- PONGE – E is out

The only valid, common English word left that fits the constraints is:

POUND.

Let’s verify:
P O U N D
- P, O, N are in their correct positions.
- U and D are letters not yet eliminated.
- No eliminated letters (A, E, I, R, S, T, Y, L, H, K) are present.

So POUND is the logical next guess.
