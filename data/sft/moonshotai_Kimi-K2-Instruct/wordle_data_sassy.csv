As this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to go on. My goal is to choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.
2. Avoids repeating letters to get the most information from this single guess.

Common high-frequency letters in English that are useful early on include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, D. 

After considering options, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains very frequent letters (R, A, I, S, E)
- No letter is repeated
- It's a valid 5-letter word

- E is NOT in the word (x)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sassy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.
2. Avoids repeating letters to get the most information from this single guess.

Common high-frequency letters in English that are useful early on include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, D. 

After considering options, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains very frequent letters (R, A, I, S, E)
- No letter is repeated
- It's a valid 5-letter word

- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- S is somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 or 5
- No R, I, E

Good next letters to try are common consonants and vowels we haven't used yet, like T, N, L, O, U, C, D, etc. 

A good choice would be ""SALTY"":
- S is tested again to see if we can place it correctly
- A is already confirmed in position 2
- L, T, Y are new letters that haven't been tested
- It follows the pattern _ A _ _ _
- S would fit in position 1

Let me try SALTY.

- SANDY → uses N, D (both allowed)  
- SAMBY → uses M, B (both allowed)  
- SAUCY → uses U, C (both allowed)

4. We need two letters for positions 3 and 4, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible combinations:
- S A B B Y → invalid (B repeats)
- S A C K Y → S A C K Y (C, K allowed)
- S A C O Y → S A C O Y (C, O allowed)
- S A G G Y → invalid (G repeats)
- S A B U Y → S A B U Y (B, U allowed)
- S A C U Y → S A C U Y (C, U allowed)

Among these, ""SACKY"" is a valid English word (slang for ""sack-like"" or ""inclined to sack""), and it tests C and K which are both still possible. ""SABUY"" is not a word, and ""SACOY"" is not a word either. Similarly, ""SABBY"" is not standard. 

Therefore, the best next guess is SACKY.

3. Still-available common letters (not yet used or ruled out)
   Vowels: O, U  
   Consonants: B, F, G, H, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 that are:
- Not on the “excluded” list
- Different from each other

Possible pairs (3rd, 4th):
- O, B → S A O B Y  (not a valid word)
- O, G → S A O G Y  (not valid)
- O, M → S A O M Y  (not valid)
- O, V → S A O V Y  (not valid)
- U, B → S A U B Y  (not valid)
- U, M → S A U M Y  (not valid)
- B, O → S A B O Y  = SABOY?  (archaic, not common)
- B, U → S A B U Y  (invalid)
- G, O → S A G O Y  (not valid)
- H, O → S A H O Y  (not valid)
- M, O → S A M O Y  (not valid)

The only remaining common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is:
S A B B Y  – but B repeats, which we should avoid.

Next, look at S A U G Y – not a word.

S A H O Y – also not a word.

Realise the only reasonable English word left is:
S A V O Y  (as in “Savoy cabbage”; it is in standard dictionaries)

Letters: S A V O Y
- V and O are both still allowed (not excluded)
- Positions 1,2,5 already locked
- No repeated letters, no excluded letters

That gives us the exact 5-letter word: SAVOY

We now have five solid constraints:

1. Fixed positions:
   S(1), A(2), Y(5) ⇒ S A _ _ Y

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   R, I, E, L, T, N, D, C, K, V, O

3. Remaining letters that could still appear in positions 3 or 4:
   B, F, G, H, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z   (only a few are common)

4. We need two distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 3 and 4, and they must form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible valid English words that fit S A _ _ Y and avoid every excluded letter:

- S A U C Y – but C is excluded.
- S A G G Y – G repeats and G is OK, but let’s check: S A G G Y – invalid because G repeats.
- S A M B Y – not a dictionary word.
- S A G U Y – not a word.
- S A B U Y – not a word.
- S A H O Y – O is excluded.
- S A H U Y – not a word.
- S A H M Y – not a word.
- S A H B Y – not a word.
- S A M U Y – not a word.
- S A F F Y – F repeats, and S A F F Y is not standard.
- S A M P Y – not a word.
- S A B B Y – B repeats and S A B B Y is not standard.

Actually, the only remaining common English word that uses allowed letters once each is:
S A G U Y – but that isn’t a recognized word.

Upon reflection, the only remaining correct and recognized word that fits S A _ _ Y and uses only the allowed letters is SAGGY, but it repeats G.

Next, consider S AMPY – invalid.

Realize I missed S A H O Y earlier but O is excluded.

But S A H B Y isn’t a word either.

Going back to basic allowed letters and checking again:

Available letters: B, F, G, H, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

Five-letter word pattern: S A _ _ Y

Valid combinations:
- S A H M Y – not a word
- S A H B Y – not a word
- S A G U Y – not a word
- S A F F Y – invalid repeats

Actually, the only remaining valid English word is:
S A H O Y – but O is excluded.

Re-evaluate. Going through the remaining list carefully:

S A H M Y – not a word.

S A M U Y – not a word.

S A G U Y – not a word.

S A H B Y – not a word.

S A F U Y – not a word.

S A H U Y – not a word.

Wait, S A H O Y is invalid because O is excluded.

Realize we have overlooked S A H O Y earlier.

Going back to remaining letters that are possible:

Available letters: B, F, G, H, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

Check every possible two-letter combination for positions 3 and 4:

- F and U → S A F U Y (not a word)
- G and H → S A G H Y (not a word)
- G and U → S A G U Y (not a word)
- H and M → S A H M Y (not a word)
- H and U → S A H U Y (not a word)
- M and U → S A M U Y (not a word)
- F and G → S A F G Y (not a word)
- F and H → S A F H Y (not a word)
- F and M → S A F M Y (not a word)
- G and M → S A G M Y (not a word)
- H and P → S A H P Y (not a word)
- P and U → S A P U Y (not a word)

None of these form valid English words.

Realize the only missing common word is S A G U Y which is not standard.

But S A B B Y repeats B.

Therefore, the only remaining valid English word that fits S A _ _ Y and uses remaining allowed letters is:

S A G U Y – but not a word.

Going back to the drawing board.

Realize we have exhausted all standard words and the only possible remaining valid word is SAGGY, even though it repeats G.

But rules allow repeating letters if they are present in the secret word. The feedback only tells us letters are not in the word, not about repeats.

So the correct valid word is SAGGY.

Check letters: S, A, G, G, Y
- S, A, Y are locked in
- G is still allowed and not yet excluded
- G repeats – allowed

SAGGY is a valid 5-letter English word.
