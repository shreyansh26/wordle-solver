For the first guess in Wordle, it's generally optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives broad coverage of frequently used letters in English words. Another good option is ""AROSE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

2. Letters definitely in the word: L (position 2), A, E
3. Letters definitely out: S, T
4. A and E must appear somewhere other than their original positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).

Good strategy: keep L in place, place A and E elsewhere, and use new common letters. We want to avoid S, T and test new consonants.

Possible next guesses following this pattern:
- FLAME (keeps L in position 2, moves A and E, adds F,M)

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:

From Guess 2 (FLAME) we learned:

- A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed)
- E is still in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed)

So the current constraints:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must include: A (not position 3), E (not position 5)
- Must not include: S, T, F, M

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives broad coverage of frequently used letters in English words. Another good option is ""AROSE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

So far we know:

4. A and E must appear somewhere other than their original positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).

Good strategy: keep L in place, place A and E elsewhere, and use new common letters. We want to avoid S, T and test new consonants.

Possible next guesses following this pattern:
- FLAME (keeps L in position 2, moves A and E, adds F,M)

From Guess 2 (FLAME) we learned:
- F and M are not in the word

So the current constraints:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must include: A (not position 3), E (not position 5)
- Must not include: S, T, F, M

We need to place A and E in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but E can't be 5), so:
- A could be in 1, 4
- E could be in 1, 4

Possible positions:
Option 1: A in 1, E in 4 → A L _ E _

Fixed:
- Position 2 = L  →  _ L _ _ _

Letters we have discovered are in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3)
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 5)

Letters we have discovered are NOT in the word:
S, T, F, M, D, R, B, O, W

Remaining vowels to place: A and E.
They must appear exactly once each, and they must appear in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Positions still available: 1, 3, 4, 5.
But:
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 → so A must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 1 or 4

Let's list the two possible vowel placements:

1. E in 1, A in 4 → E L _ A _
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 5
   Available letters (excluding all ruled-out consonants): C, G, H, I, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   Common consonants from these: C, G, H, K, N, P, V
   We need two different consonants for positions 3 and 5.

   Possible combinations:
   - E L C A N
   - E L G A N
   - E L H A N
   - E L K A N
   - E L N A C
   - E L P A N
   - E L V A N

   Valid English words from these:
   - ELCAN – not common
   - ELCAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELKAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELPAN – no
   - ELVAN – possible but not common

2. E in 1, A in 5 → E L _ _ A
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 4
   Available letters same as above.
   Possible combinations:
   - E L C H A
   - E L G A A – invalid (A twice)
   - E L K A A – invalid
   - E L N C A
   - E L P A A – invalid
   - E L V A A – invalid
   - E L C K A
   - E L N K A

   Valid English word from these:
   - ELCHA – no
   - ELNCA – no
   - ELCKA – no
   - ELNKA – no

3. E in 4, A in 5 → _ L E A _
   But E cannot be in 4 because we have:
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE)
   - E cannot be in position 4 because in this case it would be in 4, which is allowed.
   But this would require A to be in 5, which is allowed.

   So pattern: _ L E A _
   Letters used so far: L, E, A
   Positions: 1 and 5 to fill with consonants.
   Available consonants: same set as above.

   Possible combinations:
   - C L E A N
   - G L E A N
   - H L E A N
   - K L E A N
   - N L E A C
   - P L E A N
   - V L E A N

   Valid English word:
   - CLEAN – yes, a valid word
   - GLEAN – yes
   - HLEAN – no
   - KLEAN – no (spelled CLEAN)
   - PLEAN – no
   - VLEAN – no
   - NLEAC – no

   So two valid words: CLEAN, GLEAN

Remaining vowels to place: A and E.
They must appear exactly once each, and they must appear in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Positions still available: 1, 3, 4, 5.
But:
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 → so A must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 1 or 4

Let's list the two possible vowel placements:

1. E in 1, A in 4 → E L _ A _
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 5
   Available letters (excluding all ruled-out consonants): C, G, H, I, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   Common consonants from these: C, G, H, K, N, P, V
   We need two different consonants for positions 3 and 5.

   Possible combinations:
   - E L C A N
   - E L G A N
   - E L H A N
   - E L K A N
   - E L N A C
   - E L P A N
   - E L V A N

   Valid English words from these:
   - ELCAN – not common
   - ELCAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELKAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELPAN – no
   - ELVAN – possible but not common

2. E in 1, A in 5 → E L _ _ A
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 4
   Available letters same as above.
   Possible combinations:
   - E L C H A
   - E L G A A – invalid (A twice)
   - E L K A A – invalid
   - E L N C A
   - E L P A A – invalid
   - E L V A A – invalid
   - E L C K A
   - E L N K A

   Valid English word from these:
   - ELCHA – no
   - ELNCA – no
   - ELCKA – no
   - ELNKA – no

3. E in 4, A in 5 → _ L E A _
   But E cannot be in 4 because we have:
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE)
   - E cannot be in position 4 because in this case it would be in 4, which is allowed.
   But this would require A to be in 5, which is allowed.

   So pattern: _ L E A _
   Letters used so far: L, E, A
   Positions: 1 and 5 to fill with consonants.
   Available consonants: same set as above.

   Possible combinations:
   - C L E A N
   - G L E A N
   - H L E A N
   - K L E A N
   - N L E A C
   - P L E A N
   - V L E A N

   Valid English word:
   - CLEAN – yes, a valid word
   - GLEAN – yes
   - HLEAN – no
   - KLEAN – no (spelled CLEAN)
   - PLEAN – no
   - VLEAN – no
   - NLEAC – no

   So two valid words: CLEAN, GLEAN

Among these, CLEAN is a very common word and introduces C and N which are new letters.

Therefore, next guess = CLEAN.",Guess 5: CLEAN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's generally optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives broad coverage of frequently used letters in English words. Another good option is ""AROSE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: correct position (✓) in 2nd place
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. Pattern: _ L _ _ _
2. Letters definitely in the word: L (position 2), A, E
3. Letters definitely out: S, T
4. A and E must appear somewhere other than their original positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).

Good strategy: keep L in place, place A and E elsewhere, and use new common letters. We want to avoid S, T and test new consonants.

Possible next guesses following this pattern:
- FLAME (keeps L in position 2, moves A and E, adds F,M)
- PLANE (adds P,N)
- GLADE (adds G,D)

I'll choose FLAME as it tests F and M which are common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: FLAME -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(-) M(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:
- L is correct in position 2
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- S and T are not in the word

From Guess 2 (FLAME) we learned:
- F and M are not in the word
- A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed)
- E is still in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed)

So the current constraints:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must include: A (not position 3), E (not position 5)
- Must not include: S, T, F, M

We need to place A and E in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but E can't be 5), so:
- A could be in 1, 4
- E could be in 1, 4

Possible positions:
Option 1: A in 1, E in 4 → A L _ E _
Option 2: E in 1, A in 4 → E L _ A _
Option 3: A in 1, E in 5 - invalid (E can't be 5)
Option 4: E in 1, A in 5 - invalid (E can't be 5)

Looking at option 1: A L _ E _
Letters used so far: A, L, E
Need 2 more consonants from remaining common letters (B, C, D, G, H, K, N, P, R, etc.)
Trying A L B E R → ALBER (not a word)
A L G E R → ALGER (not common)
A L D E R → ALDER (valid word - type of tree)

Looking at option 2: E L _ A _
Letters used: E, L, A
Need 2 more consonants
E L D A R → ELDAR (not common)
E L B A R → ELBAR (not a word)
E L V A N → ELVAN (not common)
E L R A P → ELRAP (not a word)

Between these, ALDER seems most promising as a valid common word.

Guess 3: ALDER -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(✓) D(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating all the clues so far:
1. Fixed: L is in position 2  →  _ L _ _ _
2. Must contain: A (cannot be positions 1 or 3) and E (cannot be positions 3 or 5)
3. Must NOT contain: S, T, F, M, D, R

Remaining positions for the two required vowels:
- A can be in 4 or 5
- E can be in 1 or 4

Therefore only two possible vowel patterns:
A) E in 1, A in 4  →  E L _ A _
B) A in 4, E in 4  → impossible (two letters in same position)  
C) A in 5, E in 1  →  E L _ _ A
D) A in 4, E in 4  → impossible

So the only vowel placements are:
- E L _ A _
- E L _ _ A

We still need two consonants (positions 3 and 5) from the unused set: B, C, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S,T,F,M,D,R).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns and test new consonants:

Pattern E L _ A _ :
- ELBOW (B,W) – B is new, W is new
- ELGAR (G,R) – R already ruled out
- ELKAN (K,N) – both new
- ELBAN – not a word
- ELGAP – not a word
- ELHAN – not a word
- ELKAB – not a word

Pattern E L _ _ A :
- ELENA – N already used? no, N is allowed
- ELIAK – not a word
- ELVIA – V is new
- ELKIA – not a word
- ELBIA – not a word

Among these, ELBOW and ELENA are valid common words; ELBOW uses two brand-new consonants (B, W) which gives more information.

Therefore, next guess = ELBOW.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate everything we now know.

Fixed:
- Position 2 = L  →  _ L _ _ _

Letters we have discovered are in the word:
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3)
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 5)

Letters we have discovered are NOT in the word:
S, T, F, M, D, R, B, O, W

Remaining vowels to place: A and E.
They must appear exactly once each, and they must appear in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Positions still available: 1, 3, 4, 5.
But:
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 → so A must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 1 or 4

Let's list the two possible vowel placements:

1. E in 1, A in 4 → E L _ A _
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 5
   Available letters (excluding all ruled-out consonants): C, G, H, I, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   Common consonants from these: C, G, H, K, N, P, V
   We need two different consonants for positions 3 and 5.

   Possible combinations:
   - E L C A N
   - E L G A N
   - E L H A N
   - E L K A N
   - E L N A C
   - E L P A N
   - E L V A N

   Valid English words from these:
   - ELCAN – not common
   - ELCAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELKAN – not a word
   - ELCAN – no
   - ELPAN – no
   - ELVAN – possible but not common

2. E in 1, A in 5 → E L _ _ A
   Remaining consonants to place: positions 3 and 4
   Available letters same as above.
   Possible combinations:
   - E L C H A
   - E L G A A – invalid (A twice)
   - E L K A A – invalid
   - E L N C A
   - E L P A A – invalid
   - E L V A A – invalid
   - E L C K A
   - E L N K A

   Valid English word from these:
   - ELCHA – no
   - ELNCA – no
   - ELCKA – no
   - ELNKA – no

3. E in 4, A in 5 → _ L E A _
   But E cannot be in 4 because we have:
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE)
   - E cannot be in position 4 because in this case it would be in 4, which is allowed.
   But this would require A to be in 5, which is allowed.

   So pattern: _ L E A _
   Letters used so far: L, E, A
   Positions: 1 and 5 to fill with consonants.
   Available consonants: same set as above.

   Possible combinations:
   - C L E A N
   - G L E A N
   - H L E A N
   - K L E A N
   - N L E A C
   - P L E A N
   - V L E A N

   Valid English word:
   - CLEAN – yes, a valid word
   - GLEAN – yes
   - HLEAN – no
   - KLEAN – no (spelled CLEAN)
   - PLEAN – no
   - VLEAN – no
   - NLEAC – no

   So two valid words: CLEAN, GLEAN

Among these, CLEAN is a very common word and introduces C and N which are new letters.

Therefore, next guess = CLEAN.
