For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can give us information about multiple vowels and consonants. A good starting word should include frequently used letters without repeating any, to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Popular starting words include options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which can quickly reveal information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"", which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" this time as it covers more vowels early on.

All five letters in “AROSE” were marked ×, so none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of those letters.

For the next guess we need a word made solely from the remaining, unused letters.  
Looking at the remaining English alphabet without A, R, O, S, E, the most common still-available consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, B, H, etc., and the vowels left are I and U (since A, O, E are out).

A five-letter word that uses only letters from this restricted set and is still common is “UNTIL”.  
It contains two remaining vowels (U and I) plus three high-frequency unused consonants (N, T, L) and gives us a fresh spread of letters to test.

No letters in “UNTIL” overlap with the rejected set from the first guess.

From the first two guesses we can extract the following constraints:

1. Letters completely ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, N, T (because they appeared in guesses and were marked ×).
2. Letters we know are in the secret word:
   - L (✓ in position 5)
   - U (– indicates it is somewhere, just not in position 1)
   - I (– indicates it is somewhere, just not in position 4)
3. Positions so far:
   - _ _ _ _ L (last letter is L)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in L.
- Contains both U and I (each exactly once).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out: in other words, the alphabet without A, R, O, S, E, N, T.  
  Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels U, I, plus Y sometimes).

Let’s look for common English words that fit _ _ _ _ L with U and I somewhere.

Immediately, two common words come to mind:
- HUMID (H, U, M, I, D)
- BUILD (B, U, I, L, D) → but L is already fixed in position 5, so this would place L in both positions 4 and 5, impossible.

So “HUMID” is a valid candidate: letters are H, U, M, I, D (none ruled out), ends in L? No, ends in D.  
I misread: the word must end in L, so “HUMID” is out.

Try “CUPID” – ends in D, also out.

How about “BUILD” – ends in D.

Actually, we need a word that ends in L and contains U and I.  
Let’s list such five-letter words:

- HUMID → ends D ✗
- CIVIL → ends L ✓, but has V and I twice; we don’t know if double letters are allowed, and it’s not the most common.
- CIVIL is 5 letters, ends L, contains I (twice) and no U.
- QUILL → ends L, contains U and I. Letters Q, U, I, L, L – Q is still allowed, L can repeat (but feedback so far doesn’t rule it out).  
  It has L twice, but that may be acceptable if the secret word allows repeats.  
  However, we have no evidence the secret word has repeated letters.

- “CUBIL” – not an English word.
- “GUILD” – ends D.
- “BUILT” – ends T (ruled out).
- “FLUID” – ends D.
- “BLIMP” – ends P.
- “PLUMB” – ends B.

Wait, let’s systematically list 5-letter words ending in L that contain both U and I:

From a quick mental scan of common words:
- Until
- But we already tried UNTIL.

That’s the only common one, but we already used it.

So we need another:  
- “Civil” – ends L, but no U.
- “Quill” – ends L, has U and I.  
  Q, U, I, L, L – letters not ruled out: Q is unused, U and I must be present, L is confirmed.  
  There’s no prohibition on double L.

Therefore, “QUILL” seems the only remaining common candidate that fits all constraints.

Check:
Q – not previously guessed, not ruled out.  
U – required to appear (– from position 1).  
I – required to appear (– from position 4).  
L – confirmed in position 5 (✓).  
Second L is fine unless contradicted; feedback doesn’t say repeats are impossible.

Hence, I will guess “QUILL”.
