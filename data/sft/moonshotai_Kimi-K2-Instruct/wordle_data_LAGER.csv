For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters frequently found in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first guess often uses a mix of these. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E), covering many common vowels and consonants.
2. These letters are among the most frequently occurring in English 5-letter words.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, which maximizes the chance of getting clear feedback about each letter's presence and position.

1. We know from the feedback that none of A, R, O, S, E are in the word.

2. This means we should pick a first-guess word that avoids these letters entirely and instead employs the next most common letters. Remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

3. To maximize information, we should use a word that has five distinct letters from this pool.

So far we have ruled out every letter used in AROSE and UNTIL:  

A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I, L are all either confirmed absent (x) or present but in the wrong place (-) only for the letter L, which appeared at position 5 but is not actually in the word (it got a dash, so it’s in the word but not in the right place… wait, no – actually the feedback key says “-” means “the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position”.  For Guess 2 UNTIL → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(-) tells us:

- U, N, T, I are NOT in the word (x).
- L appears in the word “UNTIL” at position 5, and the feedback for that letter is “-”, which means L is indeed in the secret word but NOT in the 5th position.

Therefore we now know:
- Definitely absent letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I
- Present but wrongly-placed letter: L (somewhere in positions 1-4)

That leaves us with many consonants and a few vowels still available.  High-frequency remaining letters include: C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, J, Q plus the remaining vowels Y sometimes acting as a vowel.  We also want to cover additional common letters quickly.

A good choice is a word containing L plus four new, still-untested common letters.  Looking at the list, “CHYMP” is valid but rare; “GLYPH”, “FLUNK”, “CLAMP”, “BLOCK”, “FLICK”, “PLUMB”, etc.  Picking “BLOCK” covers B, L, O, C, K – but O is already ruled out.  How about “PLUMB”?  Uses P, L, U, M, B – but U is ruled out.  “FLICK”?  Uses F, L, I, C, K – but I is ruled out.  “GLYPH” uses G, L, Y, P, H – all still possible except that none of these letters have been used before.  It’s also a valid word.

There is no perfect single next guess, but “GLYPH” gives five fresh letters, includes L (which we know is in the word somewhere), and uses mostly high-frequency remaining consonants.  Let’s go with that.

(Actually double-checking: G, L, Y, P, H are all still allowed and have not been ruled out, and L is allowed in positions 1-4.)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LAGER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters frequently found in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good first guess often uses a mix of these. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E), covering many common vowels and consonants.
2. These letters are among the most frequently occurring in English 5-letter words.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, which maximizes the chance of getting clear feedback about each letter's presence and position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>1. We know from the feedback that none of A, R, O, S, E are in the word.

2. This means we should pick a first-guess word that avoids these letters entirely and instead employs the next most common letters. Remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

3. To maximize information, we should use a word that has five distinct letters from this pool.

4. A widely recommended fallback starting word when AROSE fails completely is “UNTIL” because it contains U, N, T, I, L – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

5. Therefore, “UNTIL” is the best new guess under these constraints.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have ruled out every letter used in AROSE and UNTIL:  

A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I, L are all either confirmed absent (x) or present but in the wrong place (-) only for the letter L, which appeared at position 5 but is not actually in the word (it got a dash, so it’s in the word but not in the right place… wait, no – actually the feedback key says “-” means “the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position”.  For Guess 2 UNTIL → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(-) tells us:

- U, N, T, I are NOT in the word (x).
- L appears in the word “UNTIL” at position 5, and the feedback for that letter is “-”, which means L is indeed in the secret word but NOT in the 5th position.

Therefore we now know:
- Definitely absent letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I
- Present but wrongly-placed letter: L (somewhere in positions 1-4)

That leaves us with many consonants and a few vowels still available.  High-frequency remaining letters include: C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, J, Q plus the remaining vowels Y sometimes acting as a vowel.  We also want to cover additional common letters quickly.

A good choice is a word containing L plus four new, still-untested common letters.  Looking at the list, “CHYMP” is valid but rare; “GLYPH”, “FLUNK”, “CLAMP”, “BLOCK”, “FLICK”, “PLUMB”, etc.  Picking “BLOCK” covers B, L, O, C, K – but O is already ruled out.  How about “PLUMB”?  Uses P, L, U, M, B – but U is ruled out.  “FLICK”?  Uses F, L, I, C, K – but I is ruled out.  “GLYPH” uses G, L, Y, P, H – all still possible except that none of these letters have been used before.  It’s also a valid word.

There is no perfect single next guess, but “GLYPH” gives five fresh letters, includes L (which we know is in the word somewhere), and uses mostly high-frequency remaining consonants.  Let’s go with that.

(Actually double-checking: G, L, Y, P, H are all still allowed and have not been ruled out, and L is allowed in positions 1-4.)

Uses P, L, U, M, B – but U is ruled out.  “FLICK”?  Uses F, L, I, C, K – but I is ruled out.  “GLYPH” uses G, L, Y, P, H – all still possible except that none of these letters have been used before.  It’s also a valid word.\n\nThere is no perfect single next guess, but “GLYPH” gives five fresh letters, includes L (which we know is in the word somewhere), and uses mostly high-frequency remaining consonants.  Let’s go with that.\n\n(Actually double-checking: G, L, Y, P, H are all still allowed and have not been ruled out, and L is allowed in positions 1-4.)\n\nSo the next guess is GLYPH.\n\n<guess>GLYPH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(-)\nGuess 3: GLYPH -> FEEDBACK: G(-) L(-) Y(x) P(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '1.

Now we have:

- L is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (-) → must be in 4 or 5.
- G is in the word but not in position 4 (-) → must be in 3 or 5.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-) → must be in 3 or 4.

So far known:
1: L
2: A
3: either G or E
4: either R or E (but E can’t be both 3 and 4)
5: empty (must hold whatever is not in 3 or 4)

Let’s list possible letters for each position:

Pos 3: must be E or G  
Pos 4: must be E or R (but E already placed if in 3)  
Pos 5: must be G or R (whichever still unused)

Case 1:  
Pos 3 = E → then E is used, so G must be in pos 5, R in pos 4.  
Word: L A E R G

Case 2:  
Pos 3 = G → then G is used, so E must be in pos 4, R in pos 5.  
Word: L A G E R

Both L A E R G and L A G E R are valid English 5-letter words.  
We need only one guess, so pick one.
