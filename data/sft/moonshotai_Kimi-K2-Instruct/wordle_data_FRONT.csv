For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good strategy for Wordle is to use a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE
- CRISP

I'm going to go with ""CRANE"" because it contains C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters (C, R, A, N, E are all in the top 10 most common letters). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

We now know  
- The 2nd letter is R  
- The 4th letter is N  
- The letters C, A, and E are **not** in the word at all.

That leaves positions 1, 3, and 5 to determine, using letters other than C, A, E.  
Common remaining consonants and vowels include T, I, O, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

I want a word that:
- Has R in position 2  
- Has N in position 4  
- Does **not** contain C, A, E  
- Uses other high-frequency letters to maximize information

A quick scan yields “BRING”:  
- B (new letter)  
- R in position 2 ✓  
- I (new letter)  
- N in position 4 ✓  
- G (new letter)  

No forbidden letters, and it introduces three fresh common consonants/vowels.
