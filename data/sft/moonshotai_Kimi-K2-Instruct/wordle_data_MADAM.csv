For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. However, another strong first guess is ""ARISE"" which covers all five major vowels (including Y as a vowel sound) and common consonants R and S. 

I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it tests all five vowels plus two very common consonants, which could quickly reveal if any vowels are in the word.

From the feedback on ARISE, we now know:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word does NOT contain R, I, S, E but DOES contain A somewhere (positions 2-5).

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Contains A in a new position (not first).
2. Uses other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet (like T, N, L, O, U).
3. Avoids R, I, S, E completely.

A good candidate is ""PLANT"":

   - P, L, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because the feedback was “-” at position 3).

So far we know:
- Must contain A, and A is NOT in positions 1 or 3.
- Must NOT contain R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Available consonants (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels (already know A is present, and E, I are out): O, U, and Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters NOT ruled out.
- Maximizes coverage of new letters.

A promising word is “ABACK”:
- A in position 1 is ruled out, but let’s check positions: A in 1 is invalid, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5. “ABACK” has A in 1 (invalid) and 4. Let’s see:

Actually, “ABACK” has A in positions 1 and 4: position 1 A is invalid, but position 4 A might be valid.

But “ABACK” uses B and C (new), K (new). K is allowed (not ruled out), B and C are allowed.

But we need a word where A is not in 1 or 3. “ABACK” has A in 1 (invalid) and 4 (possible). So the first A is definitely invalid, but the second A in position 4 might be valid. However, the feedback would mark the first A as wrong position.

Better to choose a word where A appears only in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Another candidate: “VOCAB” – but B is allowed, but O, C, A, V are allowed. However, A is in position 4 here.

But let’s think simpler: “MADAM” – but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but we’ve seen no info on M, D yet. But this has A in 2 and 4.

Better to choose a word where A appears only in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Another candidate: “VOCAB” – but B is allowed, but O, C, A, V are allowed. However, A is in position 4 here.

But let’s think simpler: “MADAM” – but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but we’ve seen no info on M, D yet. But this has A in 2 and 4.

2. A is NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from ARISE and PLANT) and IS in position 2 (from WACKY).
   ⇒ A must be in position 2.
3. So the word looks like _ A _ _ _
4. Letters ruled out so far:  
   R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, W, C, K, Y

5. We also know the remaining four letters must come from the “allowed” set and cannot be any of the already-eliminated ones.

We want a common word fitting _ A _ _ _.  
The most frequent remaining consonants in English are B, D, F, G, H, M.

Typical _ A _ _ _ words:
- “BADGE”, “BAGGY”, “BAMBO”, “BANJO”, “BARBS”, etc. – but many use eliminated letters (G, J, O, B, etc. might be fine; we haven’t ruled them out yet).

Among these, “BADGE” uses B, D, G, E – but E is eliminated.  
“BAGGY” uses G, Y – Y is eliminated.  
“BARBS” uses R, S – both eliminated.  
“FAVOR” uses R – eliminated.  
“VAPOR” uses P, R – both eliminated.

Looking at the still-allowed letters and commonness, “GAMMA” isn’t valid (M, A, but G, M are allowed).  
“HABIT” uses I, T – both eliminated.  
“HAMMO” uses M, O – both allowed.

A clean candidate is “HABIT” but I and T are out, so no.

Another simple one: “JUMBO” – J, U, M, B, O – all still allowed and none used in feedback yet. It fits _ A _ _ _? No, it doesn’t have A in position 2.

- “HAMMY” – M, Y; Y is out.  
- “MAFIA” – F, I; I is out.  
- “VACUA” – V, U, U; but U is allowed, V too.  

Of these, “GAMMA” and “VACUA” are valid given current constraints, but “GAMMA” repeats M and the final A is in position 5 which is fine (only position 2 A is fixed).

A promising word is “ABACK”:
- A in position 1 is ruled out, but let’s check positions: A in 1 is invalid, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5. “ABACK” has A in 1 (invalid) and 4. Let’s see:

Actually, “ABACK” has A in positions 1 and 4: position 1 A is invalid, but position 4 A might be valid.

From the latest feedback:

- JAMBO → J(x) A(✓) M(-) B(x) O(x)

We now know definitively:

1. A is in position 2 (from A(✓) in WACKY and JAMBO).
   So the word must be _ A _ _ _

2. Letters still allowed (never ruled out in any feedback):
   Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, X, Z
   Allowed vowels: A (position 2 fixed), and possibly O, U (since O was ruled out in JAMBO, and E, I are already out).
   From JAMBO, O is ruled out. So vowels left: U, and A is already fixed in position 2.

3. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, W, C, K, Y, J, B, O

4. So the remaining letters we can use are:
   D, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, X, Z

5. The word is _ A _ _ _ with A fixed in position 2, and the remaining 4 letters must come from the above allowed set.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with only those letters:
- DAFFY – Y is out, F is allowed but Y is out.
- DAGGA – G, A, G, G, A – but A is already fixed in position 2, and we’d have A again in position 5 which is allowed, but G is allowed. However, this is a very obscure word.
- GAMMA – M is allowed, G is allowed. A is fixed in position 2, so G, A, M, M, A – fits.
- HAMZA – M, Z, A – but H is allowed, A is correct, M is allowed (from M(-) we know M is in the word but not in position 3), Z is allowed.
- MAMBA – M, A, M, B, A – but B is ruled out.
- VACUA – C is out, U, A, U, A – C is out.
- HAFIZ – I, Z – I is out.
- HAKIM – K is out.
- MAFIA – I is out.
- HUMID – I, D – I is out.
- FUDGE – E is out.
- GAUZY – Z, Y – Y is out.

From this, the only common word that pops out is GAMMA:
- G, A, M, M, A – letters G, M, A are all allowed (M was (-) in JAMBO, so M is in the word but not in position 3; in GAMMA, M appears in positions 3 and 4 – but position 3 M was marked (-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 3. So GAMMA has M in positions 3 and 4. Position 3 M being (-) would conflict with GAMMA having M in position 3. So GAMMA is invalid because the M in position 3 would be (-) but the word requires M to be elsewhere.

Next option: HAMZA
- H, A, M, Z, A – positions:
  1: H (allowed)
  2: A (correct)
  3: M (from JAMBO, M is in word but not in position 3 – but HAMZA has M in position 3, which would be marked (-). So this is also invalid.)

Next: MAUVE
- M, A, U, V, E – E is out.

Next: MADAM
- M, A, D, A, M – positions:
  1: M
  2: A (correct)
  3: D
  4: A
  5: M

Letters M, A, D are all allowed. From JAMBO, M(-) means M is in word but not in position 3 – here M is in position 1 and 5, which is acceptable (not in position 3). So this fits.

Another: DAMAN – but N is out.

Thus, the best remaining common word fitting all constraints is MADAM.

</think>

The word must be _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2. From the latest feedback, M is in the word but not in position 3, and the only common word left that fits is “MADAM”.

<guess>MADAM</guess>",MADAM,"From the latest feedback:

- JAMBO → J(x) A(✓) M(-) B(x) O(x)

We now know definitively:

1. A is in position 2 (from A(✓) in WACKY and JAMBO).
   So the word must be _ A _ _ _

2. Letters still allowed (never ruled out in any feedback):
   Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, X, Z
   Allowed vowels: A (position 2 fixed), and possibly O, U (since O was ruled out in JAMBO, and E, I are already out).
   From JAMBO, O is ruled out. So vowels left: U, and A is already fixed in position 2.

3. Letters ruled out so far:
   R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, W, C, K, Y, J, B, O

4. So the remaining letters we can use are:
   D, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, X, Z

5. The word is _ A _ _ _ with A fixed in position 2, and the remaining 4 letters must come from the above allowed set.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with only those letters:
- DAFFY – Y is out, F is allowed but Y is out.
- DAGGA – G, A, G, G, A – but A is already fixed in position 2, and we’d have A again in position 5 which is allowed, but G is allowed. However, this is a very obscure word.
- GAMMA – M is allowed, G is allowed. A is fixed in position 2, so G, A, M, M, A – fits.
- HAMZA – M, Z, A – but H is allowed, A is correct, M is allowed (from M(-) we know M is in the word but not in position 3), Z is allowed.
- MAMBA – M, A, M, B, A – but B is ruled out.
- VACUA – C is out, U, A, U, A – C is out.
- HAFIZ – I, Z – I is out.
- HAKIM – K is out.
- MAFIA – I is out.
- HUMID – I, D – I is out.
- FUDGE – E is out.
- GAUZY – Z, Y – Y is out.

From this, the only common word that pops out is GAMMA:
- G, A, M, M, A – letters G, M, A are all allowed (M was (-) in JAMBO, so M is in the word but not in position 3; in GAMMA, M appears in positions 3 and 4 – but position 3 M was marked (-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 3. So GAMMA has M in positions 3 and 4. Position 3 M being (-) would conflict with GAMMA having M in position 3. So GAMMA is invalid because the M in position 3 would be (-) but the word requires M to be elsewhere.

Next option: HAMZA
- H, A, M, Z, A – positions:
  1: H (allowed)
  2: A (correct)
  3: M (from JAMBO, M is in word but not in position 3 – but HAMZA has M in position 3, which would be marked (-). So this is also invalid.)

Next: MAUVE
- M, A, U, V, E – E is out.

Next: MADAM
- M, A, D, A, M – positions:
  1: M
  2: A (correct)
  3: D
  4: A
  5: M

Letters M, A, D are all allowed. From JAMBO, M(-) means M is in word but not in position 3 – here M is in position 1 and 5, which is acceptable (not in position 3). So this fits.

Another: DAMAN – but N is out.

Thus, the best remaining common word fitting all constraints is MADAM.The word must be _ A _ _ _ with A in position 2. From the latest feedback, M is in the word but not in position 3, and the only common word left that fits is “MADAM”.",Guess 5: MADAM -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) D(✓) A(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
