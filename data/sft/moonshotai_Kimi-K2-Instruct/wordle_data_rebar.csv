For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word should ideally include frequently used letters like A, E, I, R, S, T, N, L, etc. One such word is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word early on.

Current confirmed information:

- Pos 2: E ✓

- Forbidden letters: I, S, C, T, N, L

So the pattern is: R E _ A _

Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""RE"", has ""A"" in the 4th position, and uses none of the forbidden letters.

Let’s try ""REGAL"":
- G is a common consonant.
- L is forbidden, so REGAL is invalid.

This fits all constraints:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The word should ideally include frequently used letters like A, E, I, R, S, T, N, L, etc. One such word is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word early on.

- R is in the correct 1st position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with R.
2. It contains A and E, but not where they were (A was 2nd, E was 5th).
3. It does NOT contain I or S.

Good letters left to test: T, N, L, O, U, etc.
Since A must be in 3rd, 4th, or 5th place and E must be in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place, let’s try a word that places E second (a common pattern) and A in 3rd or 4th.

Confirmed so far:
- Position 1: R ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 4: A ✓
So the pattern is R E _ A _

Letters already ruled out: I, S, C, T, N, L, D, Y, G, M

We still need consonants for positions 3 and 5 that have not been eliminated.  
Available consonants: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, etc.

The most common remaining consonants that fit are B and K.  
Let’s try REBAK:
- R(1) ✓
- E(2) ✓
- B(3) – new test
- A(4) ✓
- K(5) – new test
All letters are still allowed.
