Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. In Wordle strategy, the best first guesses typically contain common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I and avoid less common letters like Q, X, Z.

Looking at letter frequency analysis, some of the best starting words are:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

However, since I want to maximize coverage of common letters, I think CRANE is a particularly good choice because it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should provide good information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (✓)

So far we know:
- Word ends with E
- Contains N somewhere (not 4th position)
- Does NOT contain C, R, A

Good next guesses should:
1. Check common letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.)
2. Avoid C, R, A
3. Place N in possible positions (1, 2, 3, or 5 but 5 is E)
4. Include E in position 5

Possible words ending in E with N somewhere:
- SNIPE (but has P which is less common)
- STONE (has T, S, O - all good letters)
- SLIDE (has L, S, I, D)
- TONNE (but double N might be less likely)
- SPINE (has S, P, I)

STONE seems best as it tests S, T, O, N with N in position 2 (not previously tested) and E fixed at 5. This gives good coverage of common un-tested letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)  
STONE → S(-) T(x) O(-) N(-) E(✓)

Global facts:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains N (but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5).
3. It contains S (but not in position 1).
4. It contains O (but not in position 3).
5. It does NOT contain C, R, A, T.

Therefore:
- N must be in position 1 (only remaining slot).
- S and O must be in positions 2 or 4 (since they can’t be in 1,3,5).
- The still-empty slot is position 3, and available common letters not yet ruled out include D, L, I, M, etc.

Possible patterns:
N _ _ _ E  with S and O in 2 & 4.

Let’s test a word that satisfies all these constraints and uses common remaining letters:
N O S _ E → but O can’t be in 3 (already tried).
N S O _ E → O isn’t allowed in 4 (STONE feedback), but that is exactly position 4, so that’s fine.

The missing spot (position 3) can be a common letter like I, L, D, etc.  
Putting I there gives N S O I E → NSOIE (not a real word).

Switching S and O: N O S _ E → NOS _ E.  
A valid word with these constraints is NOISE.

Check:
N(1) O(2) S(4) I(3) E(5) → positions are valid (S in 4, O in 2).  
Letters fit all constraints.  
NOISE is a valid English word.

So I’ll guess NOISE.
