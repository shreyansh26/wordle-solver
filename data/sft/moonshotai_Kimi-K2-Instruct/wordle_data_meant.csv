For the first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain. Some good starting words include those with common vowels and consonants like 'SLATE', 'CRANE', or 'AUDIO'. 

I'll choose 'SLATE' because it contains:
- S, a common consonant
- L, another common consonant
- A, a common vowel
- T, a common consonant
- E, the most common vowel

This gives a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
- It includes the letters T and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 or 5 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain S or L.

Good consonants to check next (since we still have three unknown positions) would be R, N, C, or D, and the unused vowels O, I, U.

I want a word that:
- Places A in position 3 (already satisfied).
- Uses one or both of T and E, but not in their previous positions.
- Avoids S, L.

A good candidate is “CRATE”. It uses C and R (new consonants), keeps A in place, and moves E into position 2 (allowed) and T into position 5 (allowed, since T can’t be in position 4 but can be elsewhere). It also doesn’t repeat any letters we already ruled out.

We now have two clues:

1. A is definitely in position 3: _ _ A _ _
2. T and E both occur in the word, but:
   - In CRATE (C R A T E) the T was in position 4 and got “-” (wrong position), so T is not in position 4.
   - In CRATE the E was in position 5 and got “-”, so E is not in position 5.

Also, the letters S, L, C, and R are all absent.

So the mystery word:
- has A in position 3
- contains T somewhere among positions 1, 2, or 5 (T cannot be in 3 or 4)
- contains E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (E cannot be in 5)
- has no S, L, C, R

The remaining common consonants to explore are N, D, G, B, H, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels are I, O, U.

Good candidates for the unused positions 1, 2, 4, 5 must satisfy the above constraints.  
Let’s try to place the T and E.

Possible templates:
- T E A _ _  (E is allowed in position 2; T is allowed in position 1)
- T _ A E _  (E is allowed in position 4; T is allowed in position 1)
- _ T A E _  (E is allowed in position 4; T is allowed in position 2)
- _ _ A T E  (invalid: E is in position 5—ruled out)
- etc.

Let’s pick “TEACH”:
- T is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- C is already ruled out (got x in CRATE), so TEACH contains C which we know is absent—bad.

Next idea: “BEATS” contains S—out.  
“HEATH” has H twice and is redundant.

Try “MATEY”:
- M A T E Y: but A must be in position 3, so this would be _ A _ _ _ and we don’t have that.

Better template: _ _ A _ _ with A fixed in position 3.

Let’s try “GATED”:
- G A T E D:
  - A in position 2 is not allowed—must be position 3.

Try “PATEN”:
- P A T E N:
  - A must be in position 3, so this would be _ _ A _ _.

Re-order: we need the 3rd letter to be A.  

Good candidate: “P E A T _” is invalid (T would be in 4).  
“B E A T _” same issue.

Let’s list remaining letters and see a word:
Letters available: A (fixed), T, E, plus any of B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S, L, C, R).

A possible word that fits _ _ A _ _ and contains both T and E in allowed spots is “DEATH”:
- D E A T H:
  - A is in position 3 ✓
  - E is in position 2 (allowed)
  - T is in position 4, but previous feedback said T is not in position 4—invalid.

Next: “HEATH” – same T in position 4 issue.

Next: “FEAST” – S is out.

Next: “MEANT”:
- M E A N T:
  - A is in position 3 ✓
  - E is in position 2 (allowed)
  - T is in position 5 (allowed, since T only cannot be in 4)
  - M, E, N are new letters.

Looks good—let’s test:
- Contains A in 3 ✓
- Contains T in 5 (allowed)
- Contains E in 2 (allowed)
