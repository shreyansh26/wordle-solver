For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers different vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. A good starting word often includes common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and frequent consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Popular starting choices include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels but lacks common consonants)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

After considering these, I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because:
1. It has the common consonants C, R, N
2. It has the vowels A and E
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing coverage

The feedback from CRANE tells us:
- C is not in the word at all (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word must contain the letter R, but R cannot be in position 2. It also cannot contain C, A, N, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has the letter R (and not in position 2)
2. Does not contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining letters to try: S, T, O, I, U, D, L, etc.

A good next guess would try new common consonants and a different vowel. ""SPORT"" might work, but it has an 'O' which is common and 'S' and 'T' are frequent. Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" uses D, R, I, F, T - but F is less common.

""STORY"" seems good:
- S, T, O, R, Y
- Contains R (and R is now in position 4, which is a new position)
- Contains O which hasn't been tried yet
- Uses common consonants S, T

But wait, we want to avoid using positions we've eliminated. Since R can't be in position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of another word - ""BROTH"":
- B, R, O, T, H
- R is now in position 2 which we know is wrong (from CRANE feedback), so this is bad.

""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S

- Uses only letters that are not already ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We want common letters first to maximize information. Let’s look for words with R and O, and common remaining consonants like S, T, or P.

One candidate: “STORM”
- S, T, O, R, M – all allowed so far.
- R is in position 4 – allowed.

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining letters to try: S, T, O, I, U, D, L, etc.

A good next guess would try new common consonants and a different vowel. ""SPORT"" might work, but it has an 'O' which is common and 'S' and 'T' are frequent. Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" uses D, R, I, F, T - but F is less common.

""STORY"" seems good:
- S, T, O, R, Y
- Contains R (and R is now in position 4, which is a new position)
- Contains O which hasn't been tried yet
- Uses common consonants S, T

But wait, we want to avoid using positions we've eliminated. Since R can't be in position 2, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of another word - ""BROTH"":
- B, R, O, T, H
- R is now in position 2 which we know is wrong (from CRANE feedback), so this is bad.

""TRIPS"":
- T, R, I, P, S
- R is in position 2 again - same problem.

""FLIRT"":
- F, L, I, R, T
- R is in position 4 - new position
- F is less common, but this is okay.

""WORLD"":
- W, O, R, L, D
- R is in position 3 - new position
- Good consonants W, L, D and vowel O

""WORLD"" seems like a strong choice here.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: WORLD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(-) L(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. CRANE: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   – R is present but not in position 2.

2. WORLD: W(x) O(-) R(-) L(x) D(x)
   – O is present but not in position 2.
   – R is present but not in position 3.
   – W, L, D are not in the word at all.

Summarizing what we know:
- Letters that are definitely out: C, A, N, E, W, L, D
- Letters that are definitely in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): R and O
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- O cannot be in position 2.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and O.
- Places R in a position other than 2 or 3 (so positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Places O in a position other than 2 (so positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters that are not already ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We want common letters first to maximize information. Let’s look for words with R and O, and common remaining consonants like S, T, or P.

One candidate: “STORM”
- S, T, O, R, M – all allowed so far.
- R is in position 4 – allowed.
- O is in position 3 – allowed.

Another candidate: “FRONT”
- F, R, O, N, T – but N is already ruled out (x in CRANE), so this is invalid.

Another: “PROXY”
- P, R, O, X, Y – but X and Y are less common; we can do better.

Another: “SPORT”
- S, P, O, R, T – R is in position 4, O in position 3 – both allowed, and the letters are common.

Between “STORM” and “SPORT,” both are equally valid by the constraints. I’ll go with STORM because it’s slightly more common, but either would be fine.

I’ll choose STORM.

From the three pieces of feedback we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   – R is in the word, but not in position 2.

2. WORLD → W(x) O(-) R(-) L(x) D(x)

   – R is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. STORM → S(✓) T(-) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)

   – O is correct in position 3.  
   – R is correct in position 4.

So the known pattern so far is:
S _ O R _

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, W, L, D, M.

Letters we know are present: S, O, R, T (but T is not in position 2).

So T must appear somewhere in the remaining positions 2 or 5.

Candidate letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S, O, R, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has O in position 3 and R in position 4
- Uses T somewhere (must be position 2 or 5)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns:
- S T O R _  … but T would be in position 2, and feedback says T is not in position 2 (T(-) in STORM), so this is invalid.
- S _ O R T  … this satisfies all constraints. The blank (position 2) must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Common remaining letters for position 2: I, P, Y, H, etc.

Possible words:
- SPI RT  → not a valid word
- SHO RT  → SHORT  
   – H is still allowed.
   – SHORT: S(1)=✓, H(new), O(3)=✓, R(4)=✓, T(5)=new position for T, and no letters are ruled out.

SHORT fits all constraints perfectly.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" uses D, R, I, F, T - but F is less common.\n\n""STORY"" seems good:\n- S, T, O, R, Y\n- Contains R (and R is now in position 4, which is a new position)\n- Contains O which hasn\'t been tried yet\n- Uses common consonants S, T\n\nBut wait, we want to avoid using positions we\'ve eliminated.

Current knowledge:

Pattern locked so far: S _ O R T  
Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are correct (S, O, R, T).

Only position 2 remains unknown.

Letters already ruled out (from all x feedback):
C, A, N, E, W, L, D, M, H.

Hence position 2 must be an as-yet-unused consonant that yields a valid 5-letter word of the form S ? O R T.

Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, I, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for S _ O R T words:
- SPORT → P is still allowed and gives a valid word.

No other everyday candidate (SBORT, SGORT, etc.) exists.

Therefore the word must be SPORT.
