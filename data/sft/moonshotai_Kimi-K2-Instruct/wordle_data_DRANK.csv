For the first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique, common letters to test as many as possible. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters with good coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-)  → A exists but is not in position 2  
R(✓) → R is correct in position 2  
O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(x) → S is not in the word  
E(x) → E is not in the word  

So we know:  
- The word is R _ _ _ _  
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1  
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R, has an A somewhere after position 1, and avoids O, S, E.  
Possible words: RAGGY, RABID, RANKS, RAVEN, RATIO (but O is excluded), RAPID, RADIO (O excluded), etc.  

""RAPID"" fits all constraints: starts with R, contains A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2 from feedback (-)), so A must be elsewhere. Wait, no - the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 1 (since A(-) means wrong position for A). So A could be in positions 3,4,5.  

Let me re-evaluate:  
The word is: R _ _ _ _  
A must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5  
No O, S, E  

Better candidate: RANCH (R A N C H) – but C and H are less common/tested.  
Another: RABID (R A B I D) – B, I, D are decent letters to test.  
""RABID"" seems good: R(✓), test A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2, so this would give us info), test B, I, D.

Actually, since A(-) means A exists but is NOT in position 1, and position 1 is R, A could be in 3,4,5. So ""RANCH"" is valid (A in 2 is allowed because A(-) only ruled out position 1, not position 2). But the feedback (-) for A in AROSE means A was in wrong position for AROSE's structure (A in position 1), so A could be in 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.  

I think ""RANCH"" is a good next test: R is fixed, A is in a new position (2), and we test N, C, H.  

Wait, ""RANCH"" has C and H which are less common. A better word might be ""RAVEN"" but E is excluded. ""RABID"" is better: R A B I D. Tests B, I, D, and A in position 2 (which might be correct or not).

Let's carefully parse the new feedback.

Guess 2: R A B I D  
Feedback: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)

The symbols mean:
- R(-): the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- B(x): the letter B is NOT in the word at all.
- I(x): the letter I is NOT in the word at all.
- D(-): the letter D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From both guesses we now know:

1. The word contains { R, A, D } and does NOT contain { O, S, E, B, I }.
2. Position map so far:
   - Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), not R (from RABID feedback)
   - Position 2: not A (from RABID feedback), but R was correct there in AROSE (✓). Wait—this is contradictory! 
   - Correction: in AROSE, R got ✓ (correct spot), so R is fixed in position 2. In RABID, R in position 1 got (-), so that is consistent: R exists in the word and is in position 2.
   - Position 2: confirmed R (✓ from AROSE).
   - Position 5: not D (from RABID feedback).

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Letters in word: R, A, D  
Letters NOT in word: O, S, E, B, I

Thus the remaining letters must come from the rest of the alphabet, excluding the above.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ R A _ _ or _ R _ A _ or _ R _ _ A, with D somewhere among the blanks, and no other forbidden letters.

Possible structures:
- _ R A _ _ with D either in position 4 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D must be in 4): _ R A D _
- _ R _ A _ with D in 3 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D in 3): _ R D A _
- _ R _ _ A with D in 3 or 4 (but 5 is A, so D in 3 or 4): _ R D _ A or _ R _ D A

Let's list words that fit:
- _ R A D _: Could be GRADE, but E is forbidden. CRAD_? No common word. TRADE? E forbidden. FRADS? Not a word. DRAD_? Not a word. Looks like nothing here.
- _ R D A _: Could be URDAR? Not a word. ARDAL? Not 5 letters. This seems sparse.
- _ R _ D A: Could be URDDA? No. ARIDA? I is forbidden. CRUDA? U and D are allowed; let's check dictionary: ""CRUDA"" is not common. ""GRUDA""? Doesn't seem to exist.
- _ R D _ A: Could be URDAA? No. ARDIA? I forbidden. ARDUA? U allowed, ""ARDUA"" is plural of ""arduus"" but not common English. ""PRADA""? P, R, A, D, A: but A is in word, let's check: P R A D A. Does it fit letters? Contains P, R, A, D — all allowed. And structure: P R A D A. Check positions:
   - Position 1: P (allowed, not ruled out)
   - Position 2: R (correct per AROSE)
   - Position 3: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 3)
   - Position 4: D (allowed, not ruled out for position 4)
   - Position 5: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 5)
   - Contains no forbidden letters.

""PRADA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DRADA""? But position 1 cannot be D because D is in word but not in position 5 (from RABID), but position 1 is possible. However, D R A D A: D in position 1 is allowed, but we have two D's, which may not be efficient for info. Also, double D's uncommon.

""GRAND""? Contains N and G. Let's check:
- G R A N D:
  - G: allowed
  - R: correct position 2
  - A: allowed, not in position 2 (ok, it's in 3)
  - N: allowed
  - D: allowed, in position 5 — but D(-) from RABID means D is in word but not in position 5. Thus D in position 5 is forbidden. So GRAND is invalid.

""FRAND""? Not a word.

""TRAGA""? Not a word.

""PRADA"" seems the only plausible common word fitting constraints.

Therefore, next guess: PRADA.

- _ R A _ _ with D either in position 4 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D must be in 4): _ R A D _
- _ R _ A _ with D in 3 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D in 3): _ R D A _
- _ R _ _ A with D in 3 or 4 (but 5 is A, so D in 3 or 4): _ R D _ A or _ R _ D A

Let's list words that fit:
- _ R A D _: Could be GRADE, but E is forbidden. CRAD_? No common word. TRADE? E forbidden. FRADS? Not a word. DRAD_? Not a word. Looks like nothing here.
- _ R D A _: Could be URDAR? Not a word. ARDAL? Not 5 letters. This seems sparse.
- _ R _ D A: Could be URDDA? No. ARIDA? I is forbidden. CRUDA? U and D are allowed; let's check dictionary: ""CRUDA"" is not common. ""GRUDA""? Doesn't seem to exist.
- _ R D _ A: Could be URDAA? No. ARDIA? I forbidden. ARDUA? U allowed, ""ARDUA"" is plural of ""arduus"" but not common English. ""PRADA""? P, R, A, D, A: but A is in word, let's check: P R A D A. Does it fit letters? Contains P, R, A, D — all allowed. And structure: P R A D A. Check positions:
   - Position 1: P (allowed, not ruled out)
   - Position 2: R (correct per AROSE)
   - Position 3: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 3)
   - Position 4: D (allowed, not ruled out for position 4)
   - Position 5: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 5)
   - Contains no forbidden letters.

""PRADA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DRADA""? But position 1 cannot be D because D is in word but not in position 5 (from RABID), but position 1 is possible. However, D R A D A: D in position 1 is allowed, but we have two D's, which may not be efficient for info. Also, double D's uncommon.

""GRAND""? Contains N and G. Let's check:
- G R A N D:
  - G: allowed
  - R: correct position 2
  - A: allowed, not in position 2 (ok, it's in 3)
  - N: allowed
  - D: allowed, in position 5 — but D(-) from RABID means D is in word but not in position 5. Thus D in position 5 is forbidden. So GRAND is invalid.

""FRAND""? Not a word.

""TRAGA""? Not a word.

""PRADA"" seems the only plausible common word fitting constraints.

Therefore, next guess: PRADA.",Guess 3: PRADA -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,DRANK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique, common letters to test as many as possible. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters with good coverage.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-)  → A exists but is not in position 2  
R(✓) → R is correct in position 2  
O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(x) → S is not in the word  
E(x) → E is not in the word  

So we know:  
- The word is R _ _ _ _  
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1  
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R, has an A somewhere after position 1, and avoids O, S, E.  
Possible words: RAGGY, RABID, RANKS, RAVEN, RATIO (but O is excluded), RAPID, RADIO (O excluded), etc.  

""RAPID"" fits all constraints: starts with R, contains A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2 from feedback (-)), so A must be elsewhere. Wait, no - the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 1 (since A(-) means wrong position for A). So A could be in positions 3,4,5.  

Let me re-evaluate:  
The word is: R _ _ _ _  
A must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5  
No O, S, E  

Better candidate: RANCH (R A N C H) – but C and H are less common/tested.  
Another: RABID (R A B I D) – B, I, D are decent letters to test.  
""RABID"" seems good: R(✓), test A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2, so this would give us info), test B, I, D.

Actually, since A(-) means A exists but is NOT in position 1, and position 1 is R, A could be in 3,4,5. So ""RANCH"" is valid (A in 2 is allowed because A(-) only ruled out position 1, not position 2). But the feedback (-) for A in AROSE means A was in wrong position for AROSE's structure (A in position 1), so A could be in 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.  

I think ""RANCH"" is a good next test: R is fixed, A is in a new position (2), and we test N, C, H.  

Wait, ""RANCH"" has C and H which are less common. A better word might be ""RAVEN"" but E is excluded. ""RABID"" is better: R A B I D. Tests B, I, D, and A in position 2 (which might be correct or not).

I think ""RABID"" is the best next guess.

<guess>RABID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's carefully parse the new feedback.

Guess 2: R A B I D  
Feedback: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)

The symbols mean:
- R(-): the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- B(x): the letter B is NOT in the word at all.
- I(x): the letter I is NOT in the word at all.
- D(-): the letter D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From both guesses we now know:

1. The word contains { R, A, D } and does NOT contain { O, S, E, B, I }.
2. Position map so far:
   - Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), not R (from RABID feedback)
   - Position 2: not A (from RABID feedback), but R was correct there in AROSE (✓). Wait—this is contradictory! 
   - Correction: in AROSE, R got ✓ (correct spot), so R is fixed in position 2. In RABID, R in position 1 got (-), so that is consistent: R exists in the word and is in position 2.
   - Position 2: confirmed R (✓ from AROSE).
   - Position 5: not D (from RABID feedback).

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Letters in word: R, A, D  
Letters NOT in word: O, S, E, B, I

Thus the remaining letters must come from the rest of the alphabet, excluding the above.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ R A _ _ or _ R _ A _ or _ R _ _ A, with D somewhere among the blanks, and no other forbidden letters.

Possible structures:
- _ R A _ _ with D either in position 4 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D must be in 4): _ R A D _
- _ R _ A _ with D in 3 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D in 3): _ R D A _
- _ R _ _ A with D in 3 or 4 (but 5 is A, so D in 3 or 4): _ R D _ A or _ R _ D A

- _ R A D _: Could be GRADE, but E is forbidden. CRAD_? No common word. TRADE? E forbidden. FRADS? Not a word. DRAD_? Not a word. Looks like nothing here.
- _ R D A _: Could be URDAR? Not a word. ARDAL? Not 5 letters. This seems sparse.

- _ R D _ A: Could be URDAA? No. ARDIA? I forbidden. ARDUA? U allowed, ""ARDUA"" is plural of ""arduus"" but not common English. ""PRADA""? P, R, A, D, A: but A is in word, let's check: P R A D A. Does it fit letters? Contains P, R, A, D — all allowed. And structure: P R A D A. Check positions:
   - Position 1: P (allowed, not ruled out)
   - Position 2: R (correct per AROSE)
   - Position 3: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 3)
   - Position 4: D (allowed, not ruled out for position 4)
   - Position 5: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 5)
   - Contains no forbidden letters.

""PRADA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DRADA""? But position 1 cannot be D because D is in word but not in position 5 (from RABID), but position 1 is possible. However, D R A D A: D in position 1 is allowed, but we have two D's, which may not be efficient for info. Also, double D's uncommon.

  - R: correct position 2
  - A: allowed, not in position 2 (ok, it's in 3)

Let's break down all the information we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word  
- R – position 2 (✓ from AROSE and PRADA)  
- A – must appear somewhere (it was “-” in AROSE and PRADA, meaning “present but wrong place”)  
- D – must appear somewhere (it was “-” in RABID and PRADA, meaning “present but wrong place”)  

Letters known NOT to be in the word  
O, S, E, B, I, P

Forbidden positions  
- Position 1: P ruled out (PRADA feedback), nothing else yet.  
- Position 2: R (fixed).  
- Position 3: A is NOT here (PRADA gave A(✓) in position 3, so this is actually correct; ignore earlier misread). Wait—PRADA feedback was P(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-).  
   - R(✓) at 2 – confirmed.  
   - A(✓) at 3 – confirmed.  
   - D(-) at 4 – so D exists but is not at 4.  
   - The final A(-) at 5 – means the second A is present but not at 5.  
   - Therefore positions so far:  
        1 _  
        2 R  
        3 A  
        4 _ (but not D)  
        5 _ (and not A)  
   - We still need D somewhere; the only open legal spot is 1 or 5, but 5 cannot be A and we already have A at 3, so 5 could be D. However D(-) at 4 only tells us D isn’t at 4, so 5 is allowed.  
   - We have no constraints on position 1 other than it cannot be P (and cannot be any of O,S,E,B,I).  

So the pattern is: _ R A _ _  
with an additional D somewhere, and no second A required (because we only have one A confirmed at 3).  
The missing letters must come from the remaining alphabet excluding the banned set {O,S,E,B,I,P}.  
Available letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the needed D.

Possible words fitting _ R A _ _ with D somewhere:
- D R A _ _  – but position 1 can’t be D if we want D elsewhere; let’s see.  
- _ R A D _  – position 4 would be D, but PRADA said D(-) at 4, so D cannot be at 4.  
- _ R A _ D – position 5 can be D.  

So the only viable placement is _ R A _ D (D at 5).  
We need a letter for position 1 and 4 such that the whole word is valid and all letters are allowed.  
Let’s look for common English words matching: ? R A ? D and containing only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- G R A N D – but N is allowed, D at 5 is allowed. All letters {G,R,A,N,D} are allowed.  
  Checks:  
  – G: allowed  
  – R: fixed at 2  
  – A: fixed at 3  
  – N: allowed  
  – D: allowed at 5 (D(-) only forbade 4)  
- F R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A N D – not a word.  
- T R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A Z D – not a word.  
- G R A V D – not a word.  

The only common English word left fitting the constraints is GRAND.

Let me verify:  
GRAND: G R A N D  
- Letters: G, R, A, N, D – all allowed.  
- Positions:  
  1 G – allowed  
  2 R – correct  
  3 A – correct  
  4 N – allowed  
  5 D – allowed (only forbidden at 4)  

Looks perfect.

Let’s look for common English words matching: ? R A ? D and containing only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- G R A N D – but N is allowed, D at 5 is allowed. All letters {G,R,A,N,D} are allowed.  
  Checks:  
  – G: allowed  
  – R: fixed at 2  
  – A: fixed at 3  
  – N: allowed  
  – D: allowed at 5 (D(-) only forbade 4)  
- F R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A N D – not a word.  
- T R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A Z D – not a word.  
- G R A V D – not a word.  

The only common English word left fitting the constraints is GRAND.

Let me verify:  
GRAND: G R A N D  
- Letters: G, R, A, N, D – all allowed.  
- Positions:  
  1 G – allowed  
  2 R – correct  
  3 A – correct  
  4 N – allowed  
  5 D – allowed (only forbidden at 4)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,DRANK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique, common letters to test as many as possible. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters with good coverage.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-)  → A exists but is not in position 2  
R(✓) → R is correct in position 2  
O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(x) → S is not in the word  
E(x) → E is not in the word  

So we know:  
- The word is R _ _ _ _  
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1  
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R, has an A somewhere after position 1, and avoids O, S, E.  
Possible words: RAGGY, RABID, RANKS, RAVEN, RATIO (but O is excluded), RAPID, RADIO (O excluded), etc.  

""RAPID"" fits all constraints: starts with R, contains A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2 from feedback (-)), so A must be elsewhere. Wait, no - the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 1 (since A(-) means wrong position for A). So A could be in positions 3,4,5.  

Let me re-evaluate:  
The word is: R _ _ _ _  
A must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5  
No O, S, E  

Better candidate: RANCH (R A N C H) – but C and H are less common/tested.  
Another: RABID (R A B I D) – B, I, D are decent letters to test.  
""RABID"" seems good: R(✓), test A in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2, so this would give us info), test B, I, D.

Actually, since A(-) means A exists but is NOT in position 1, and position 1 is R, A could be in 3,4,5. So ""RANCH"" is valid (A in 2 is allowed because A(-) only ruled out position 1, not position 2). But the feedback (-) for A in AROSE means A was in wrong position for AROSE's structure (A in position 1), so A could be in 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.  

I think ""RANCH"" is a good next test: R is fixed, A is in a new position (2), and we test N, C, H.  

Wait, ""RANCH"" has C and H which are less common. A better word might be ""RAVEN"" but E is excluded. ""RABID"" is better: R A B I D. Tests B, I, D, and A in position 2 (which might be correct or not).

I think ""RABID"" is the best next guess.

<guess>RABID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's carefully parse the new feedback.

Guess 2: R A B I D  
Feedback: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)

The symbols mean:
- R(-): the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- B(x): the letter B is NOT in the word at all.
- I(x): the letter I is NOT in the word at all.
- D(-): the letter D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From both guesses we now know:

1. The word contains { R, A, D } and does NOT contain { O, S, E, B, I }.
2. Position map so far:
   - Position 1: not A (from AROSE feedback), not R (from RABID feedback)
   - Position 2: not A (from RABID feedback), but R was correct there in AROSE (✓). Wait—this is contradictory! 
   - Correction: in AROSE, R got ✓ (correct spot), so R is fixed in position 2. In RABID, R in position 1 got (-), so that is consistent: R exists in the word and is in position 2.
   - Position 2: confirmed R (✓ from AROSE).
   - Position 5: not D (from RABID feedback).

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Letters in word: R, A, D  
Letters NOT in word: O, S, E, B, I

Thus the remaining letters must come from the rest of the alphabet, excluding the above.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ R A _ _ or _ R _ A _ or _ R _ _ A, with D somewhere among the blanks, and no other forbidden letters.

Possible structures:
- _ R A _ _ with D either in position 4 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D must be in 4): _ R A D _
- _ R _ A _ with D in 3 or 5 (but 5 cannot be D, so D in 3): _ R D A _
- _ R _ _ A with D in 3 or 4 (but 5 is A, so D in 3 or 4): _ R D _ A or _ R _ D A

Let's list words that fit:
- _ R A D _: Could be GRADE, but E is forbidden. CRAD_? No common word. TRADE? E forbidden. FRADS? Not a word. DRAD_? Not a word. Looks like nothing here.
- _ R D A _: Could be URDAR? Not a word. ARDAL? Not 5 letters. This seems sparse.
- _ R _ D A: Could be URDDA? No. ARIDA? I is forbidden. CRUDA? U and D are allowed; let's check dictionary: ""CRUDA"" is not common. ""GRUDA""? Doesn't seem to exist.
- _ R D _ A: Could be URDAA? No. ARDIA? I forbidden. ARDUA? U allowed, ""ARDUA"" is plural of ""arduus"" but not common English. ""PRADA""? P, R, A, D, A: but A is in word, let's check: P R A D A. Does it fit letters? Contains P, R, A, D — all allowed. And structure: P R A D A. Check positions:
   - Position 1: P (allowed, not ruled out)
   - Position 2: R (correct per AROSE)
   - Position 3: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 3)
   - Position 4: D (allowed, not ruled out for position 4)
   - Position 5: A (allowed, not ruled out for position 5)
   - Contains no forbidden letters.

""PRADA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DRADA""? But position 1 cannot be D because D is in word but not in position 5 (from RABID), but position 1 is possible. However, D R A D A: D in position 1 is allowed, but we have two D's, which may not be efficient for info. Also, double D's uncommon.

""GRAND""? Contains N and G. Let's check:
- G R A N D:
  - G: allowed
  - R: correct position 2
  - A: allowed, not in position 2 (ok, it's in 3)
  - N: allowed
  - D: allowed, in position 5 — but D(-) from RABID means D is in word but not in position 5. Thus D in position 5 is forbidden. So GRAND is invalid.

""FRAND""? Not a word.

""TRAGA""? Not a word.

""PRADA"" seems the only plausible common word fitting constraints.

Therefore, next guess: PRADA.

<guess>PRADA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) B(x) I(x) D(-)
Guess 3: PRADA -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's break down all the information we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word  
- R – position 2 (✓ from AROSE and PRADA)  
- A – must appear somewhere (it was “-” in AROSE and PRADA, meaning “present but wrong place”)  
- D – must appear somewhere (it was “-” in RABID and PRADA, meaning “present but wrong place”)  

Letters known NOT to be in the word  
O, S, E, B, I, P

Forbidden positions  
- Position 1: P ruled out (PRADA feedback), nothing else yet.  
- Position 2: R (fixed).  
- Position 3: A is NOT here (PRADA gave A(✓) in position 3, so this is actually correct; ignore earlier misread). Wait—PRADA feedback was P(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-).  
   - R(✓) at 2 – confirmed.  
   - A(✓) at 3 – confirmed.  
   - D(-) at 4 – so D exists but is not at 4.  
   - The final A(-) at 5 – means the second A is present but not at 5.  
   - Therefore positions so far:  
        1 _  
        2 R  
        3 A  
        4 _ (but not D)  
        5 _ (and not A)  
   - We still need D somewhere; the only open legal spot is 1 or 5, but 5 cannot be A and we already have A at 3, so 5 could be D. However D(-) at 4 only tells us D isn’t at 4, so 5 is allowed.  
   - We have no constraints on position 1 other than it cannot be P (and cannot be any of O,S,E,B,I).  

So the pattern is: _ R A _ _  
with an additional D somewhere, and no second A required (because we only have one A confirmed at 3).  
The missing letters must come from the remaining alphabet excluding the banned set {O,S,E,B,I,P}.  
Available letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the needed D.

Possible words fitting _ R A _ _ with D somewhere:
- D R A _ _  – but position 1 can’t be D if we want D elsewhere; let’s see.  
- _ R A D _  – position 4 would be D, but PRADA said D(-) at 4, so D cannot be at 4.  
- _ R A _ D – position 5 can be D.  

So the only viable placement is _ R A _ D (D at 5).  
We need a letter for position 1 and 4 such that the whole word is valid and all letters are allowed.  
Let’s look for common English words matching: ? R A ? D and containing only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- G R A N D – but N is allowed, D at 5 is allowed. All letters {G,R,A,N,D} are allowed.  
  Checks:  
  – G: allowed  
  – R: fixed at 2  
  – A: fixed at 3  
  – N: allowed  
  – D: allowed at 5 (D(-) only forbade 4)  
- F R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A N D – not a word.  
- T R A N D – not a word.  
- C R A Z D – not a word.  
- G R A V D – not a word.  

The only common English word left fitting the constraints is GRAND.

Let me verify:  
GRAND: G R A N D  
- Letters: G, R, A, N, D – all allowed.  
- Positions:  
  1 G – allowed  
  2 R – correct  
  3 A – correct  
  4 N – allowed  
  5 D – allowed (only forbidden at 4)  

Looks perfect.

Let's re-assemble the current state.

Letters we **know** are in the word and their positions:
- R is fixed at position 2 (✓ from AROSE, PRADA, GRAND).
- A is fixed at position 3 (✓ from PRADA, GRAND).
- N is fixed at position 4 (✓ from GRAND).

Letters we **know** are in the word but **not yet placed**:
- D (D(-) in every place it has appeared so far: positions 4 in RABID, 4 in PRADA, 5 in GRAND — so D is NOT in 4 or 5, and must be in 1 or 3. But position 3 is already A, so D must be in position 1).

So the word is now fully determined: D R A N _

But wait, positions:
- 1: must be D (only remaining place for D)
- 2: R (fixed)
- 3: A (fixed)
- 4: N (fixed)
- 5: ?

But GRAND gave N(✓) at 4, so position 5 is still open. However, we have no more letters to place — all required letters are D,R,A,N — so position 5 must be one of these letters or a new letter. But we have no constraints forcing another letter, and the word must be 5 letters.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From GRAND feedback: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(-)

- R,A,N are correct in positions 2,3,4 respectively.
- D is in word but NOT in position 5 (D(-) at position 5).
- D has appeared at positions 4 (PRANDA - no, wait PRADA had D at 4 with D(-)), and position 5 now with D(-). So D cannot be at 4 or 5. Thus D must be at position 1 (only remaining spot).

So the word must be: D R A N _

Now, what is position 5? We have used D,R,A,N. We have no constraints on position 5 except:
- Cannot be any of O,S,E,B,I,P,G (from previous feedback)
- Cannot be D,R,A,N (already used)
- Must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

From remaining letters, common endings for DRAN_:
- DRANK - K is allowed
- DRANT - not a word
- DRANO - O is forbidden
- DRANE - E is forbidden
- DRANG - G is forbidden

Only ""DRANK"" is valid.

Check:
DRANK: D,R,A,N,K
- All letters allowed (K not previously excluded)
- Positions:
  1: D – allowed (only remaining spot for D)
  2: R – correct
  3: A – correct
  4: N – correct
  5: K – allowed

Thus, the only possible word left is ""DRANK"".
