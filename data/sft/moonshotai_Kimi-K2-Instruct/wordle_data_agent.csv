Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. My best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers different positions to maximize the information gained from the feedback. I'll use ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A (common vowel)
- N, E (other common letters)
This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback:

- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is in the word AND in the correct 4th position (✓)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ N _
- It contains A and E somewhere, but A is not in 3rd position and E is not in 5th position
- It does NOT contain C or R

Since we need to place A and E in different positions, and we know N is fixed in 4th, let's construct possible words:

A could be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
E could be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 5th)

Let's try a word that incorporates these constraints. ""LEANE"" would be invalid since E can't be in 5th. How about ""EAGAN""? Wait, that has two A's which might not be optimal.

A better approach is to choose a word that:
1. Has N in 4th position
2. Contains both A and E in new positions
3. Uses new consonants we haven't tested yet

""BEANS"" would have N in 4th, E in 2nd, A in 3rd - but A can't be in 3rd.

Updated constraints from both guesses:

1. Pattern: _ _ E N _  (E in 3rd, N in 4th, confirmed)
2. Letters in word but wrong positions:
   - A (must be in 1st or 2nd or 5th, but not 3rd)
   - E is already correctly placed in 3rd, so no additional E needed
3. Letters NOT in word: C, R, L  
4. Must place A once, and it must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th (not 3rd, already have E there)
5. Need two more distinct letters for remaining open slots.

Let’s list open positions: 1, 2, 5  
We know A must go into one of these.

Possible placements for A:
- A _ E N _
- _ A E N _
- _ _ E N A

We need to fill the other two slots with new consonants not yet used (avoiding C, R, L).

Good unused consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
- A S E N T  (A 1st, S 2nd, T 5th) – all letters new and valid  
- M A E N S  (M 1st, A 2nd, S 5th) – new letters  
- S A E N T  (S 1st, A 2nd, T 5th) – new letters  
- T A E N S  (T 1st, A 2nd, S 5th) – new letters  

Among these, ""ASENT"" is not valid English; ""MASEN"" not valid; ""SENTA"" no.  
""MEANT"" is valid English and fits: M 1st, E 3rd, A 2nd, N 4th, T 5th.  
Check constraints:
- A is in 2nd (allowed)  
- E in 3rd (correct)  
- N in 4th (correct)  
- New consonants: M, T  

So ""MEANT"" is a strong candidate.

Another valid word: ""BEANS"" – but N is 4th, E 3rd, A 2nd, B 1st, S 5th – also valid.  
But ""MEANT"" uses T which is common.

Let’s choose ""MEANT"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

My best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers different positions to maximize the information gained from the feedback. I'll use ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes:

- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ N _
- It contains A and E somewhere, but A is not in 3rd position and E is not in 5th position
- It does NOT contain C or R

Since we need to place A and E in different positions, and we know N is fixed in 4th, let's construct possible words:

A could be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
E could be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 5th)

Let's try a word that incorporates these constraints. ""LEANE"" would be invalid since E can't be in 5th. How about ""EAGAN""? Wait, that has two A's which might not be optimal.

A better approach is to choose a word that:
1. Has N in 4th position
2. Contains both A and E in new positions
3. Uses new consonants we haven't tested yet

""BEANS"" would have N in 4th, E in 2nd, A in 3rd - but A can't be in 3rd.

- _ _ E N A

We need to fill the other two slots with new consonants not yet used (avoiding C, R, L).

Good unused consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
- A S E N T  (A 1st, S 2nd, T 5th) – all letters new and valid  
- M A E N S  (M 1st, A 2nd, S 5th) – new letters  
- S A E N T  (S 1st, A 2nd, T 5th) – new letters  
- T A E N S  (T 1st, A 2nd, S 5th) – new letters  

Among these, ""ASENT"" is not valid English; ""MASEN"" not valid; ""SENTA"" no.  
""MEANT"" is valid English and fits: M 1st, E 3rd, A 2nd, N 4th, T 5th.  
Check constraints:
- A is in 2nd (allowed)  
- E in 3rd (correct)  
- N in 4th (correct)  
- New consonants: M, T  

So ""MEANT"" is a strong candidate.

Another valid word: ""BEANS"" – but N is 4th, E 3rd, A 2nd, B 1st, S 5th – also valid.  
But ""MEANT"" uses T which is common.

Let’s choose ""MEANT"".

Now we have three pieces of feedback to fold into the constraints.

1. From Guess 1 (CRANE):
   – C(x), R(x)  → never present  
   – A(-)        → A is in the word, but **not** in position 3  
   – N(✓)        → N is in position 4  
   – E(-)        → E is in the word, but **not** in position 5  

2. From Guess 2 (ELENA):
   – E(-)        → E is in the word, but **not** in position 1  
   – L(x)        → L never present  
   – E(✓)        → E is in position 3  
   – N(✓)        → confirms N in position 4  
   – A(-)        → A is in the word, but **not** in position 5  

3. From Guess 3 (MEANT):
   – M(x)        → M never present  
   – E(-)        → E is in the word, but **not** in position 2  
   – A(-)        → A is in the word, but **not** in position 3 (we already knew that)  
   – N(✓)        → still confirms N in 4  
   – T(✓)        → T is in position 5  

Putting it all together:

Positions: 1  2  3  4  5  
Known:    _  _  E  N  T  

Letters that must appear: A (somewhere in 1 or 2)  
Forbidden letters: C, R, L, M  
Additional letters needed: one more distinct consonant for either position 1 or 2 (whichever is not taken by A).

So the word looks like one of these two skeletons:

- A _ E N T   → need a consonant for position 2  
- _ A E N T   → need a consonant for position 1  

Common unused consonants to test next: B, D, F, G, H, K, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick the skeleton “A _ E N T” and try consonants for position 2.

Valid English candidates:
- AGENT – uses G  
- ASENT – invalid, not a word  
- AVENT – archaic/dialect, risky  
- AMENT – botanical term, obscure  

Among these, “AGENT” is the clearest valid word.  
Check constraints:
- A in 1 (allowed)  
- G new, unused, allowed  
- E in 3 (matches)  
- N in 4 (matches)  
- T in 5 (matches)  

No conflicts.  Therefore “AGENT” is the logical next guess.
