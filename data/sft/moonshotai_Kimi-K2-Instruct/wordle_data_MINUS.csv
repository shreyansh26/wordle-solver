For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the hidden word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the most common letters without repeats.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (all marked with x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (feedback shows N(-), so it’s not in the fourth position).

Key takeaways:
1. Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
3. We need a new word that does not use C, R, A, E and places N elsewhere.

Common letters left to test (excluding CRANE’s eliminated ones): S, T, I, L, O, D, U, M, P, B, H, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Since N is confirmed, I’ll construct a word that includes N but not in the 4th spot. A good approach is to test other common letters. Let’s try ""SNOUT"":
- S, N (not in 4th spot), O, U, T. None of these are eliminated, and N is in a new position (2nd).

Alternative checks:
- Does ""SNOUT"" avoid all eliminated letters? Yes (no C, R, A, E).
- Is N in a new position? Yes (2nd vs. original 4th).
- Does it use common remaining letters? Yes (S, N, O, U, T are all fairly common).

No conflicts, so this is a solid next guess.

Possible patterns:

2. _ U N _ S

Good candidates:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (all marked with x).

Key takeaways:
1. Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E
2. N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
3. We need a new word that does not use C, R, A, E and places N elsewhere.

Common letters left to test (excluding CRANE’s eliminated ones): S, T, I, L, O, D, U, M, P, B, H, G, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Since N is confirmed, I’ll construct a word that includes N but not in the 4th spot. A good approach is to test other common letters. Let’s try ""SNOUT"":
- S, N (not in 4th spot), O, U, T. None of these are eliminated, and N is in a new position (2nd).

Alternative checks:

- Is N in a new position? Yes (2nd vs. original 4th).
- Does it use common remaining letters? Yes (S, N, O, U, T are all fairly common).

Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, O, T  
Letter confirmed in word: U (and it’s in the 4th position)  
Letters “present but misplaced”: N, S (both marked “-”)

So:
- The word contains U as its 4th letter.
- It also contains N and S, but neither is currently in the right spot.
- Available (untested) common letters: D, I, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Test placements:
- N and S cannot go where we tried before (N was 2nd, S was 1st).
- Position 1: can’t be S (already tried); could be N, but then where does S go?
- Position 2: available.
- Position 3: available.
- Position 5: available.

Let’s build a word that fits:
- 4th letter = U
- Contains N and S, neither in prior positions
- Uses only still-allowed letters.

A good candidate: “LUNGS”
- L (new)
- U (position 4 ✓)
- N (new position 3)
- G (new)
