For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters in 5-letter words
- It has both vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S)
- It covers different positions of common letters
This will help eliminate or confirm a large number of possible letters in the secret word.

- Places A in none of its eliminated positions (it does not contain A, but that’s impossible).

Let's update our knowledge:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
R, I, S, E, C, H, N, T, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown):  
A, L, Y  (all three marked “-”, meaning present but wrong slot)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 2, not 3, not 1 (from AMPLY)
- L: not 4
- Y: not 5

So A must be in slot 4 or 5.  
L must be in slot 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Y must be in slot 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Available common letters not yet tried:  
B, D, F, G, K, O, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, L, Y  
2. Puts A in 4 or 5  
3. Puts L in 1/2/3/5  
4. Puts Y in 1/2/3/4  
5. Uses only letters from the “still-possible” list.

One such word is “LODAY” — but D isn’t guaranteed to be legal yet; also, we’d like to test multiple fresh consonants.

Another option: “GOALY” — uses G, O, plus A, L, Y and satisfies the placement constraints (A in 4, L in 3, Y in 5). However, Y can’t be in 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong first guess because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters in 5-letter words
- It has both vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S)
- It covers different positions of common letters
This will help eliminate or confirm a large number of possible letters in the secret word.

- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, or E
- The A is NOT in the 2nd position (from RAISE)

Since we know A is in the word but not 2nd position, we need a word that has A elsewhere and avoids R, I, S, E. Good consonants to try next would be T, N, L, C, D, etc. 

A strong next guess would be ""CHANT"":
- Contains A (in 3rd position)
- Uses new consonants C, H, N, T
- Avoids all eliminated letters (R, I, S, E)

Since A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5, and we want to test several new common consonants, a word like ""PLUMB"" fits those constraints:
- Uses P, L, U, M, B — all letters that have not been tested yet.
- Places A in none of its eliminated positions (it does not contain A, but that’s impossible).  
Oops, that guess cannot contain A at all. Let’s instead use a word that places A in a new position while also testing fresh consonants.

A good candidate: ""GLADY"" — wait, Y is uncommon and D is still okay, but let’s try a more common word.

Better: ""FOCAL"" — but C is already eliminated.

The latest feedback tells us:

- Position 3: L is now ✓ (locked in place)
- Position 4: A is still ✓ (already locked)
- Position 5: Y is still “-” — meaning Y is in the word but is NOT in the 5th position
- Positions 1 and 2: G and U are both x (not in the word)

So far we know the secret word has the pattern:

_ _ L A _

and must contain the letter Y somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

Letters already ruled out:  
R, I, S, E, C, H, N, T, M, P, O, G, U

Still-allowed common letters:  
B, D, F, K, V, W, Y

We need a word that:
- Has L in 3, A in 4
- Has Y in 1 or 2
- Uses only the allowed remaining letters for the unused slots

List possible candidates:

Y _ L A _  or  _ Y L A _

With remaining consonants:

- Y B L A _  → YBLAD (invalid, D is ok but must use only allowed letters)
- Y D L A _  → YDLA? (no 5-letter word)
- Y K L A _  → YKLA? (no)
- B Y L A _  → BYLAD (no)
- D Y L A _  → DYLAC (invalid)
- F Y L A _  → FYLA? (no)
- K Y L A _  → KYLAN (not a valid word)
- B Y L A B  → not valid
- D Y L A D → not valid
- F Y L A F → not valid
- W Y L A _ → WYLAM (no)

Valid English 5-letter words actually fitting the pattern:

- BYLAW (B, Y, L, A, W — all allowed, Y in 2)
- KYACK (invalid, C out)
- DYLAN (proper noun)
- WYLAM (proper noun)

Only common, valid word left is BYLAW.

Check:
B, Y, L, A, W — none are excluded.
Positions: B-1 ✔, Y-2 ✔, L-3 ✔, A-4 ✔, W-5 ✔.  
And Y is not in the 5th position (matches the feedback).

Therefore the only remaining possible word is BYLAW.
