Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, the best strategy is to choose a word with common English letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word contains vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc., are popular choices for first guesses because they cover many common letters.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letters are repeated, giving maximum coverage of different letters

This should provide good baseline information regardless of what the secret word is.

3. R and O are not in the word at all.
4. E is not in the word.

- Ends with S
- Contains A in position 2, 3, or 4
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- Uses new letters to gather more information

Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, D, C, etc. Considering the constraints, possible structures are:
- _ A _ _ S

- _ _ _ A S

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAILS"":

Combining both rounds of feedback:

1. From AROSE:  
   - S is in the word and is fixed in the 5th spot.  
   - A is present but not in the 1st or 2nd position, and not 5th (which is S). So A must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - E, R, O are absent.  
   - T, I, L are now also absent (from TAILS).  

2. From TAILS:  
   - S was marked “-”, which seems contradictory to the “✓” it received earlier.  
   Interpreting the second “-” as “correct letter but wrong position” is impossible because S was already confirmed at position 5.  
   The only consistent reading is that the second feedback simply re-uses “-” to mean “correct letter, already in the right position”; therefore S is still fixed at slot 5.  
   - A is again marked “-”, confirming it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
   - L is marked “-”, so L is present but not in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3.  
   - T and I are absent.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
- Letters known to be present: A (pos 3 or 4), L (pos 1, 2, or 3)  
- Letters ruled out: E, R, O, T, I  
- Need a new word that ends in S, uses A and L in allowable spots, and introduces fresh, still-possible consonants (N, D, G, C, etc.)

Possible templates:
1) L _ A _ S  
2) _ L A _ S  
3) L _ _ A S  
4) _ _ L A S  

Let’s pick a common word fitting one of these. Option 2: _ L A _ S  
Candidate: “CLANS” – uses C, N (new letters), keeps A in 3rd, L in 2nd, ends with S.  
But C is fine; check if any letters are already excluded: none of C, N, A, L, S are excluded.  

Another candidate: “GLANS” – but G is less common, and we want high-frequency letters to maximize information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word contains vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc., are popular choices for first guesses because they cover many common letters.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letters are repeated, giving maximum coverage of different letters

This should provide good baseline information regardless of what the secret word is.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with S in the 5th position.
2. A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is already S), so A is in positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. R and O are not in the word at all.
4. E is not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains A in position 2, 3, or 4
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- Uses new letters to gather more information

Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, D, C, etc. Considering the constraints, possible structures are:
- _ A _ _ S
- _ _ A _ S
- _ _ _ A S

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAILS"":
- Ends with S
- Contains A in the 3rd position
- Uses new consonants T, I, L
- Doesn't reuse R, O, E

C L A M S  
C L A P S  
C L A G S (rare)  
C L A B S (British slang)  

The two most frequent are CLADS and CLAMS. Between them, “CLAMS” uses the very common letter M, while “CLADS” is slightly less common.  
I’ll choose the higher-frequency one first.

So the only sensible remaining guess is “CLAMS”.",Guess 5: CLAMS -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x) S(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,CLASH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, the best strategy is to choose a word with common English letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word contains vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc., are popular choices for first guesses because they cover many common letters.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letters are repeated, giving maximum coverage of different letters

This should provide good baseline information regardless of what the secret word is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R and O are not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word ends with S in the 5th position.
2. A is somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is already S), so A is in positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. R and O are not in the word at all.
4. E is not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains A in position 2, 3, or 4
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- Uses new letters to gather more information

Good consonants to try next could be T, N, L, D, C, etc. Considering the constraints, possible structures are:
- _ A _ _ S
- _ _ A _ S
- _ _ _ A S

A strong next guess would be a word like ""TAILS"":
- Ends with S
- Contains A in the 3rd position
- Uses new consonants T, I, L
- Doesn't reuse R, O, E

Other options could be ""PAINS"", ""WAITS"", ""CAINS"", but ""TAILS"" seems good as it uses very common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TAILS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Combining both rounds of feedback:

1. From AROSE:  
   - S is in the word and is fixed in the 5th spot.  
   - A is present but not in the 1st or 2nd position, and not 5th (which is S). So A must be in position 3 or 4.  
   - E, R, O are absent.  
   - T, I, L are now also absent (from TAILS).  

2. From TAILS:  
   - S was marked “-”, which seems contradictory to the “✓” it received earlier.  
   Interpreting the second “-” as “correct letter but wrong position” is impossible because S was already confirmed at position 5.  
   The only consistent reading is that the second feedback simply re-uses “-” to mean “correct letter, already in the right position”; therefore S is still fixed at slot 5.  
   - A is again marked “-”, confirming it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
   - L is marked “-”, so L is present but not in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3.  
   - T and I are absent.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
- Letters known to be present: A (pos 3 or 4), L (pos 1, 2, or 3)  
- Letters ruled out: E, R, O, T, I  
- Need a new word that ends in S, uses A and L in allowable spots, and introduces fresh, still-possible consonants (N, D, G, C, etc.)

Possible templates:
1) L _ A _ S  
2) _ L A _ S  
3) L _ _ A S  
4) _ _ L A S  

Let’s pick a common word fitting one of these. Option 2: _ L A _ S  
Candidate: “CLANS” – uses C, N (new letters), keeps A in 3rd, L in 2nd, ends with S.  
But C is fine; check if any letters are already excluded: none of C, N, A, L, S are excluded.  

Another candidate: “GLANS” – but G is less common, and we want high-frequency letters to maximize information.  

Best choice right now: “CLANS”.

<guess>CLANS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TAILS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(-) S(-)
Guess 3: CLANS -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s unwrap the new feedback for CLANS:

- C(✓) – the letter C is in the word and is in the 1st position.
- L(✓) – the letter L is in the word and is in the 2nd position.
- A(✓) – the letter A is in the word and is in the 3rd position.
- N(x) – the letter N is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – once again the feedback marks “-” for S; as before, this simply re-confirms that S is already locked into the 5th position.

So the pattern is now completely fixed:

Position 1: C  
Position 2: L  
Position 3: A  
Position 4: ?  
Position 5: S  

We just need to find the single missing letter for position 4.

Letters already ruled out from earlier guesses: E, R, O, T, I, N.

Letters still allowed for position 4 (common consonants not yet used): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Scanning common English 5-letter words that start “CLA” and end “S”, the only frequent one is:

C L A S S – but S is already in position 5 and cannot repeat.

C L A W S – uses W, which hasn’t been excluded.

C L A P S – P hasn’t been excluded.

C L A G S – less common.

C L A N S – already tried (N was rejected).

C L A P S – plausible, but let’s check “CLAWS” first since it’s more common.

Therefore the most likely word is “CLAWS”.

(If the game disallows S twice, the next would be “CLAPS”, but S is already fixed at 5 so repetition is impossible.)

So the only 5-letter word fitting C L A _ S with allowed letters is “CLAWS”.

Only slot 4 is unknown.

Letters already ruled out: E, R, O, T, I, N, W
