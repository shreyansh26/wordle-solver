Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, etc.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and will help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

3. Avoid any of the letters we’ve ruled out: S, A, T, E.

So far we have:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
- Letter **in** the word, but we still don’t know where: L (and it is NOT in positions 2 or 3, since it got “-” there)

That leaves a limited set of still-possible letters: B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y plus the one known L.

Since L must appear somewhere and cannot be in positions 2 or 3, possible slots for L are 1, 4, or 5.

A smart next word would:
1. Place L in position 4 or 5 to test one of the remaining slots.
2. Use other common, still-valid consonants and a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out.

The vowels left are O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).  
Consonants left include R, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:
- L in position 5  
- two other consonants that are common but not yet tried: R, C  
- two vowels: O, U  

The word “CLOUD” comes to mind, but O and U are both vowels and we only see one vowel missing so far.  
Another option: “WORLD” — but D is fine, and W is still possible.  
However, W would be new, and we have O as the only vowel in the mix.

Let’s refine:  
We want one vowel and two new consonants plus L.  
A strong candidate is “BLOCK”:
- B (new), L (known), O (new vowel), C (new), K (new).  
But O is only one vowel.

Wait, we need to be sure we don’t repeat any ruled-out letters, and we want to place L in a new spot.  

Let me try “BURLY”:
- B, U, R, L (position 4), Y  
All letters are still possible, L is placed in position 4.  

This seems good: B, U, R, Y are all untested so far, and L in position 4 tests that slot.

But Y is sometimes a vowel. Maybe simpler: “BURLY” still fits.

Another check:  
Ruled out letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
So B, U, R, L, Y are all currently allowed.

Therefore I’ll go with “BURLY”.

- Letters **not** in the word at all: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
- Letter **in** the word, but we still don’t know where: L (and it is NOT in positions 2 or 3, since it got “-” there)

That leaves a limited set of still-possible letters: B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y plus the one known L.

Since L must appear somewhere and cannot be in positions 2 or 3, possible slots for L are 1, 4, or 5.

A smart next word would:
1. Place L in position 4 or 5 to test one of the remaining slots.
2. Use other common, still-valid consonants and a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out.

The vowels left are O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).  
Consonants left include R, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:
- L in position 5  
- two other consonants that are common but not yet tried: R, C  
- two vowels: O, U  

The word “CLOUD” comes to mind, but O and U are both vowels and we only see one vowel missing so far.  
Another option: “WORLD” — but D is fine, and W is still possible.  
However, W would be new, and we have O as the only vowel in the mix.

Let’s refine:  
We want one vowel and two new consonants plus L.  
A strong candidate is “BLOCK”:
- B (new), L (known), O (new vowel), C (new), K (new).  
But O is only one vowel.

Wait, we need to be sure we don’t repeat any ruled-out letters, and we want to place L in a new spot.  

Let me try “BURLY”:
- B, U, R, L (position 4), Y  
All letters are still possible, L is placed in position 4.  

This seems good: B, U, R, Y are all untested so far, and L in position 4 tests that slot.

But Y is sometimes a vowel. Maybe simpler: “BURLY” still fits.

Another check:  
Ruled out letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
So B, U, R, L, Y are all currently allowed.

Therefore I’ll go with “BURLY”.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, etc.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and will help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) – L is present somewhere but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L (but not in position 2)

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains L once or more, but not in the 2nd position.
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, or E.

Our next guess should:
1. Re-use L in a different position to confirm its placement.
2. Introduce other common letters that have not been ruled out (e.g., R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, P, B, etc.).
3. Avoid any of the letters we’ve ruled out: S, A, T, E.

A good candidate is ""FLING"":
- F – common consonant, not yet tested.
- L – known to be in the word (placed in position 2 this time to check if it’s correct there).
- I – common vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.
- N – common consonant.
- G – common consonant.

This guess tests F, I, N, G (all still possible) while moving L to a new spot.

That leaves a limited set of still-possible letters: B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y plus the one known L.

Since L must appear somewhere and cannot be in positions 2 or 3, possible slots for L are 1, 4, or 5.

A smart next word would:
1. Place L in position 4 or 5 to test one of the remaining slots.
2. Use other common, still-valid consonants and a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out.

The vowels left are O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).  
Consonants left include R, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:

But Y is sometimes a vowel. Maybe simpler: “BURLY” still fits.

Another check:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, etc.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and will help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) – L is present somewhere but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L (but not in position 2)

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains L once or more, but not in the 2nd position.
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, or E.

Our next guess should:
1. Re-use L in a different position to confirm its placement.
2. Introduce other common letters that have not been ruled out (e.g., R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, P, B, etc.).
3. Avoid any of the letters we’ve ruled out: S, A, T, E.

A good candidate is ""FLING"":
- F – common consonant, not yet tested.
- L – known to be in the word (placed in position 2 this time to check if it’s correct there).
- I – common vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.
- N – common consonant.
- G – common consonant.

This guess tests F, I, N, G (all still possible) while moving L to a new spot.

<guess>FLING</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FLING -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
- Letter **in** the word, but we still don’t know where: L (and it is NOT in positions 2 or 3, since it got “-” there)

That leaves a limited set of still-possible letters: B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y plus the one known L.

Since L must appear somewhere and cannot be in positions 2 or 3, possible slots for L are 1, 4, or 5.

A smart next word would:
1. Place L in position 4 or 5 to test one of the remaining slots.
2. Use other common, still-valid consonants and a vowel or two that haven’t been ruled out.

The vowels left are O, U, Y (and sometimes Y).  
Consonants left include R, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:
- L in position 5  
- two other consonants that are common but not yet tried: R, C  
- two vowels: O, U  

The word “CLOUD” comes to mind, but O and U are both vowels and we only see one vowel missing so far.  
Another option: “WORLD” — but D is fine, and W is still possible.  
However, W would be new, and we have O as the only vowel in the mix.

Let’s refine:  
We want one vowel and two new consonants plus L.  
A strong candidate is “BLOCK”:
- B (new), L (known), O (new vowel), C (new), K (new).  
But O is only one vowel.

Wait, we need to be sure we don’t repeat any ruled-out letters, and we want to place L in a new spot.  

Let me try “BURLY”:
- B, U, R, L (position 4), Y  
All letters are still possible, L is placed in position 4.  

This seems good: B, U, R, Y are all untested so far, and L in position 4 tests that slot.

But Y is sometimes a vowel. Maybe simpler: “BURLY” still fits.

Another check:  
Ruled out letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G  
So B, U, R, L, Y are all currently allowed.

Therefore I’ll go with “BURLY”.

<guess>BURLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

Letters **not** in the word:  
S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, B, U, R

Letters **confirmed** and their positions:
- Position 4: L (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ L Y

Letters still available (and not ruled out):  
C, D, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, plus any others not yet eliminated.

We need three more letters for positions 1, 2, 3, chosen only from the still-allowed set, and forming a valid English word ending in LY.

Common 5-letter words ending in “LY” that use only remaining letters:

- HOLLY (H, O, L, L, Y) – but L is already in position 4 and repeating it might be allowed, but we need to check letters: H, O are still possible, L is allowed, but double-L is acceptable.  
- MOLLY  
- KOLLY (not a word)  
- CULLY (C, U, L, L, Y) – U is ruled out.  
- DOLLY (D, O, L, L, Y) – D and O are allowed, L appears twice.  
- POLLY (P, O, L, L, Y) – P and O allowed.  

Among these, **DOLLY** or **HOLLY** or **MOLLY** fit.

Let’s pick **DOLLY** because D and O are common and still allowed.

Check letters:  
D (ok), O (ok), L (ok), L (ok), Y (ok).  
None of the banned letters appear.

So the next guess is DOLLY.

Confirmed positions after HOWLY:
Position 2: O
Position 3: W
Position 4: L
Position 5: Y

The remaining slot is position 1.  
Still-available letters (never ruled out): C, K, M, P, V (H, D, B, R, U, etc. are all out).

Only common 5-letter English word that fits the pattern ?OWLY is “COWLY” (a variant spelling of “coolly” or an archaic form), but it’s obscure. The only standard English word that fits is “JOWLY” – but J was never tested, and we have 6 tries total and this is the 6th.

However, from the still-allowed set (C, K, M, P, V), the sole actual word that works is:

C O W L Y → “cowly” (rare but listed in some dictionaries).

Since we’ve exhausted common letters, and this is our last guess, we go with it.
