3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that contains common letters in the English language and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. Words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU are popular starting guesses for this reason. 

I'll go with **CRANE** because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good feedback on several high-frequency letters.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word at all.  
Since all five letters are eliminated, I want a completely new set of letters that are still common in 5-letter English words.  
Good second-guess choices use fresh vowels and consonants.  
Options that avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E include:  
- S, T, O, I, L  
- S, T, O, I, U  
- S, T, O, U, L  

Let’s pick “STOIL” (valid per Wordle dictionary) because it contains:  
- S and T (two very common consonants)  
- O and I (common vowels)  
- L (another common consonant)  

None of these letters overlap with the previously ruled-out set.

So far we have eliminated:
Letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I  
Letters in the word but not yet placed: O, L  

We still have 12 other letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a word that:
- contains O and L (since they’re in the word)
- does **not** contain any of the already-eliminated letters
- ideally tests a few new consonants

A good candidate is “BLOWY” if we treat Y as a vowel here, but that introduces W and B and keeps O, L.  
Another candidate is “GLOOM” but it has two O’s and adds G, M.  
“FLOOM” isn’t valid, but “FLOOD” contains the O twice and adds D.  
“GLOUP” (slang for gloop) isn’t a standard word.  
“LOWLY” repeats L and uses W, Y.  
“POLYP” uses P, but has P, Y.  
“JOLLY” repeats L and adds J, Y.  

The most straightforward valid word that uses O, L and adds two new letters is “BLOWY” (B, L, O, W, Y).  
However, “BLOWY” is a bit obscure. A more common word is “LOWLY” (L, O, W, L, Y).  
It has two L’s, but we know L is in the word, so that’s acceptable. It also introduces W and Y.
