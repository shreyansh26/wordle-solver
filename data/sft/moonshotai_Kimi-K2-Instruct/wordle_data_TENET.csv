For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters. Some good starter words include CRANE, SLATE, or AUDIO. 

Let me choose CRANE as it includes:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel
This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N is in position 4, so N is not in position 4.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, E is in position 5, so E is not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- The word DOES contain N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids C, R, A, and has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively. We also want to introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Possible options:
- E is not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1-4.
- N is not in position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.

A good next guess would be something like ""STONE"":
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- N: known to be in the word (and here not in position 4)
- E: known to be in the word (and here not in position 5)

Possible remaining letters to try for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next approach is to test common consonants for positions 2 and 5. Let's try:
- Position 2: common consonants like H, L, M, B, G
- Position 5: common ending letters like H, K, L, M, Y

Let's pick a word that uses these constraints. For example:
- THINE: but I is new vowel, but we already have E in position 4
- TWINE: W is new
- THANE: but A is already excluded

TWINE looks valid:
- T (✓) in position 1
- W (new letter) in position 2
- N (✓) in position 3

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A common strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters. Some good starter words include CRANE, SLATE, or AUDIO. 

Let me choose CRANE as it includes:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel
This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N is in position 4, so N is not in position 4.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, E is in position 5, so E is not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- The word DOES contain N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids C, R, A, and has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively. We also want to introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Possible options:
- E is not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1-4.
- N is not in position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.

A good next guess would be something like ""STONE"":
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- N: known to be in the word (and here not in position 4)
- E: known to be in the word (and here not in position 5)

This gives us good coverage of new letters (S, T, O) while respecting the known constraints.

1. Contain N, E, T
2. Place them in positions that satisfy the constraints above

Current template: T _ N E _

Letters definitely absent: C, R, A, S, O, U, D, W, I

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 & 5:
B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, etc.

Common English endings for a T _ N E _ pattern often use H, K, L, M, Y.

Let’s try the most frequent ones:
- THENK – but E is already in position 4, so duplicate E would be allowed, but K is new.
- THEME – again E is duplicate but allowed; M and E are both valid.
- TYNED – already rejected.
- THYME – H and Y are new, M new, E duplicate but allowed.

THYME uses:
- T in 1 ✓
- H in 2 (new)
- N in 3 ✓
- E in 4 ✓
- Y and M are both new and consonants.

This tests H and M, plus Y at the end.",Guess 5: THYME -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters. Some good starter words include CRANE, SLATE, or AUDIO. 

Let me choose CRANE as it includes:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel
This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, N is in position 4, so N is not in position 4.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In CRANE, E is in position 5, so E is not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- The word DOES contain N (not in position 4) and E (not in position 5).

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids C, R, A, and has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively. We also want to introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Possible options:
- E is not in position 5, so it could be in positions 1-4.
- N is not in position 4, so it could be in positions 1-3 or 5.

A good next guess would be something like ""STONE"":
- S: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- N: known to be in the word (and here not in position 4)
- E: known to be in the word (and here not in position 5)

This gives us good coverage of new letters (S, T, O) while respecting the known constraints.

<guess>STONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STONE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  In STONE, T is in position 2 → T is not in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  In STONE, N is in position 4 → N is not in position 4.  (confirms earlier finding)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  In STONE, E is in position 5 → E is not in position 5.  (confirms earlier finding)

Combine with the previous CRANE feedback:
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, O
Letters we know ARE in the word: N, E, T

Known positional constraints:
- N ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5
- T ≠ 2

Next word should:
1. Contain N, E, T
2. Place them in positions that satisfy the constraints above
3. Introduce new common consonants/vowels (D, L, I, U, etc.)

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- TENTH → T in 1, E in 2, N in 3, but has H (new letter) and T again – not ideal
- TUNED → T in 1, U (new), N in 3, E in 4 → satisfies: N not in 4, E not in 5, T not in 2
- INLET → I (new), N in 2, L (new), E in 4, T in 5 → but E is in 4 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed)
- UNITE → U (new), N in 2, I (new), T in 4, E in 5 → E in 5 is NOT allowed (must not be 5)

TUNED looks good: T, U, N, E, D
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U new vowel
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- D new consonant

<guess>TUNED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 3: TUNED -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on TUNED:
- T is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is T
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is N
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is E
- U is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)

So far we know the word looks like: T _ N E _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, O, U, D
Letters we know are in the word and placed: T (pos 1), N (pos 3), E (pos 4)
Letters we still need to determine: positions 2 and 5

From earlier feedback, we also know that N was not in position 4 (but we've confirmed it's in position 3, so that's fine), and E was not in position 5 (but we've confirmed it's in position 4, so that's also fine).

Possible remaining letters to try for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next approach is to test common consonants for positions 2 and 5. Let's try:
- Position 2: common consonants like H, L, M, B, G
- Position 5: common ending letters like H, K, L, M, Y

Let's pick a word that uses these constraints. For example:
- THINE: but I is new vowel, but we already have E in position 4
- TWINE: W is new
- THANE: but A is already excluded
- TONNE: O is excluded
- TYNED: but D is excluded

TWINE looks valid:
- T (✓) in position 1
- W (new letter) in position 2
- N (✓) in position 3
- E (✓) in position 4
- I (new vowel) in position 5

This tests W in position 2 and I in position 5, both new letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract every fact we have so far.

1. From CRANE  
   C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   ⇒ still N ≠ 4, E ≠ 5.

3. From TUNED  
   T(✓), U(x), N(✓), E(✓), D(x)  
   ⇒ T is in position 1.  
   ⇒ N is in position 3.  
   ⇒ E is in position 4.  
   ⇒ word does not contain U, D.

4. From TWINE  
   T(✓), W(x), I(x), N(-), E(-)  
   ⇒ word does not contain W, I.  
   ⇒ N is NOT in position 4 (we already know it’s in 3, so this is consistent).  
   ⇒ E is NOT in position 5 (we already know it’s in 4, so this is consistent).

Letters definitely absent: C, R, A, S, O, U, D, W, I

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 & 5:
B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, etc.

Common English endings for a T _ N E _ pattern often use H, K, L, M, Y.

- THEME – again E is duplicate but allowed; M and E are both valid.

THYME uses:

- Y and M are both new and consonants.

This tests H and M, plus Y at the end.

Current template: T _ N E _

Letters already ruled out (x in at least one guess):
C, R, A, S, O, U, D, W, I, H, Y, M

Remaining candidate letters for positions 2 and 5:  
B, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, etc.

We need two distinct letters from that set.  
Among them, L and K are both common and have not been tried.

Try:
- T in 1 (fixed)
- L in 2
- N in 3 (fixed)
- E in 4 (fixed)
- K in 5

That forms T L N E K → but that is not a valid English word.

Reverse: T K N E L – also invalid.

Instead, test the sequence T _ N E _ with the next two best choices:
G and K → T G N E K – invalid  
P and K → T P N E K – invalid  
B and K → T B N E K – invalid  
F and K → T F N E K – invalid  

Only single-letter slot remains position 2 and 5 – the only valid English word that fits is T E N E T – but E is already in position 4 and a duplicate E would be allowed, yet we know E is in 4, not in 5, so 5 must be a consonant.

Actually, simpler: pick the most straightforward remaining consonants: B and K  
→ T B N E K – invalid  
→ T G N E K – invalid  

Let’s re-examine: the only remaining valid English word that matches the pattern T _ N E _ and uses only the still-allowed letters is:

T U N E S – but S is ruled out.  
T E N E T – E in 5 is not allowed.  
T I N E A – I and A ruled out.  

Going back to the allowed consonants: B, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V.

Scanning mental dictionary for T _ N E _:

- T B N E _ – nothing  
- T F N E _ – nothing  
- T G N E _ – nothing  
- T K N E _ – nothing  
- T L N E _ – nothing  
- T P N E _ – nothing  
- T V N E _ – nothing  

Wait – the pattern T _ N E _ is actually quite restrictive. The only common valid word fitting is:

T I N E Y – but I and Y are out.  
T U N E D – U and D are out.  
T O N E R – O and R are out.  
T A N E K – A out.  

Actually, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is:

T E N E T – but E is in position 4, and we can’t put another E in 2 or 5 without violating earlier info.

Recheck the dictionary: the word T I N E A – invalid letters.

Wait, let’s list the exact pattern: T _ N E _ and the only valid English word remaining is T E N E T – but E is in 4 and can’t be in 5. So 5 must be a consonant.

The only valid word left is T E N E T – but that has E in 2 and 5, and 5 is not allowed.

Let me check again: T _ N E _ with remaining letters.

Actually, there’s one valid word: T E N E T – but E can’t be in 5.

Wait, the correct pattern is T _ N E _ with E fixed at 4.

Thus, the only valid word left is T E N E T – but E can’t be in 5.

But we know E is in 4, not 5, so:

T E N E _ – but that’s T E N E T or T E N E S – S out.

Actually, the only valid word remaining is T E N E T – but E in 2 is allowed as long as not in 5.

But T E N E T fits:  
T(1) ✓  
E(2) – allowed  
N(3) ✓  
E(4) ✓  
T(5) – but T is already in 1, and we haven’t ruled out duplicates. However, we have no evidence against T appearing twice.

But let’s check if TEN E T is the word: TEN E T is spelled TENET.

T E N E T – let’s verify:

- T in 1 ✓  
- E in 2 – no prior constraint except E not in 5 (ok)  
- N in 3 ✓  
- E in 4 ✓  
- T in 5 – no constraint against T again  

All letters used are still allowed, and it’s a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess is TENET.

B, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, etc.

We need two distinct letters from that set.  
Among them, L and K are both common and have not been tried.

Try:
- T in 1 (fixed)
- L in 2
- N in 3 (fixed)
- E in 4 (fixed)
- K in 5

That forms T L N E K → but that is not a valid English word.

Reverse: T K N E L – also invalid.

Instead, test the sequence T _ N E _ with the next two best choices:
G and K → T G N E K – invalid  
P and K → T P N E K – invalid  
B and K → T B N E K – invalid  
F and K → T F N E K – invalid  

Only single-letter slot remains position 2 and 5 – the only valid English word that fits is T E N E T – but E is already in position 4 and a duplicate E would be allowed, yet we know E is in 4, not in 5, so 5 must be a consonant.

Actually, simpler: pick the most straightforward remaining consonants: B and K  
→ T B N E K – invalid  
→ T G N E K – invalid  

Let’s re-examine: the only remaining valid English word that matches the pattern T _ N E _ and uses only the still-allowed letters is:

T U N E S – but S is ruled out.  
T E N E T – E in 5 is not allowed.  
T I N E A – I and A ruled out.  

Going back to the allowed consonants: B, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V.

Scanning mental dictionary for T _ N E _:

- T B N E _ – nothing  
- T F N E _ – nothing  
- T G N E _ – nothing  
- T K N E _ – nothing  
- T L N E _ – nothing  
- T P N E _ – nothing  
- T V N E _ – nothing  

Wait – the pattern T _ N E _ is actually quite restrictive. The only common valid word fitting is:

T I N E Y – but I and Y are out.  
T U N E D – U and D are out.  
T O N E R – O and R are out.  
T A N E K – A out.  

Actually, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is:

T E N E T – but E is in position 4, and we can’t put another E in 2 or 5 without violating earlier info.

Recheck the dictionary: the word T I N E A – invalid letters.

Wait, let’s list the exact pattern: T _ N E _ and the only valid English word remaining is T E N E T – but E is in 4 and can’t be in 5. So 5 must be a consonant.

The only valid word left is T E N E T – but that has E in 2 and 5, and 5 is not allowed.

Let me check again: T _ N E _ with remaining letters.

Actually, there’s one valid word: T E N E T – but E can’t be in 5.

Wait, the correct pattern is T _ N E _ with E fixed at 4.

Thus, the only valid word left is T E N E T – but E can’t be in 5.

But we know E is in 4, not 5, so:

T E N E _ – but that’s T E N E T or T E N E S – S out.

Actually, the only valid word remaining is T E N E T – but E in 2 is allowed as long as not in 5.

But T E N E T fits:  
T(1) ✓  
E(2) – allowed  
N(3) ✓  
E(4) ✓  
T(5) – but T is already in 1, and we haven’t ruled out duplicates. However, we have no evidence against T appearing twice.

But let’s check if TEN E T is the word: TEN E T is spelled TENET.

T E N E T – let’s verify:

- T in 1 ✓  
- E in 2 – no prior constraint except E not in 5 (ok)  
- N in 3 ✓  
- E in 4 ✓  
- T in 5 – no constraint against T again  

All letters used are still allowed, and it’s a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess is TENET.",Guess 6: TENET -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(✓) N(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
