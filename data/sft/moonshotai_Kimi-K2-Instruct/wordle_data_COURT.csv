For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use as many of these letters as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- ALIEN (uses A, L, I, E, N)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Step-by-step deduction:

1. Letters NOT in the word (crossed out so far):  
   A, S, E, N, D, F, L

2. Letters that ARE in the word (still to place correctly):  
   O, U, R

3. Positional constraints after all feedback:
   - O was in position 2 in ROUND and was marked ✓, but in FLOUR it was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
     Therefore O must be in position 2, nowhere else.
   - U must appear somewhere, but not in position 3 (from ROUND) and not in position 4 (from FLOUR).  
     So U can be 1 or 5.
   - R must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 (from AROSE), 3 (from ROUND), or 5 (from FLOUR).  
     So R can only be 4.

4. Current pattern:  
   _ O _ R _

5. The remaining two letters must be chosen from the still-unused set  
   {B, C, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z}  
   and must fit letters 1 and 5 while satisfying the U placement.

   Since U must be at 1 or 5, and we need to fill the other spot with one of those unused consonants, we can try both possibilities quickly.

   Possibility 1: U at 1  
   Pattern becomes U O _ R _  
   Last letter: any unused consonant.  
   Possible word: U O _ R _  → UORCH, UORCH invalid.  
   UORCH isn’t a word.  
   UORCH → no.  
   Try UORCH → no.  
   Try UORCH → no.  
   Better: U O C R Y → UOCRY (not a word).  
   U O M R K → UOMRK (invalid).  
   U O B R T → UOBRT (invalid).  
   None look like common words.  

   Possibility 2: U at 5  
   Pattern becomes _ O _ R U  
   First letter: any unused consonant.  
   Looking for common 5-letter words ending in RU:  
   - “VORRU” – invalid.  
   - “CORRU” – invalid.  
   - “TORRU” – invalid.  
   Wait, let me list real words that fit _ O _ R U.  
   Actual valid word: “PORCH” ends in CH, not RU.  
   “BOGRU” – invalid.  
   “WORRU” – invalid.  
   “MORRU” – invalid.  

   Hmm.  
   Re-examine: maybe U is at 1 and we choose a valid word.  
   U O _ R _  
   Only common word fitting is: “VORRU” – invalid.  
   Let me list real words that fit _ O _ R U:  
   - “JOKRU” – invalid.  
   - “COBRA” – not ending in RU.  
   - “FORUM” – no.  
   - “MOTOR” – no.  
   - “COLOR” – no.  

   Wait, let me check:  
   Pattern _ O _ R U  
   Real word ending in RU:  
   - “FORUM” – ends in UM.  
   - “CORNU” – exists! CORNU (a horn-shaped anatomical structure).

   CORNU fits:
   - C (unused)  
   - O (fixed at 2)  
   - R (fixed at 4)  
   - N (but N was already ruled out in ROUND – N(x)).  
   So CORNU is invalid.

   Next try: “BOGRU” – invalid.  
   “WORRU” – invalid.  
   “MORRU” – invalid.  

   Let me try a different consonant at position 5.  
   U at 5 forces last letter to be U, so only valid English word I can think of ending in …ORU is “KORUN” – invalid.  

   Therefore U must be at 1.  
   Pattern: U O _ R _  
   Need a valid word.  
   U O _ R _  
   Valid word: UORCH – invalid.  
   U O B R A – A ruled out.  
   U O C R Y – invalid.  
   U O G R Y – invalid.  
   U O M R Y – invalid.  
   U O T R Y – invalid.  

   Actually, let me list all remaining consonants:  
   {B, C, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
   I need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ O _ R _.  
   But U must be either 1 or 5.  

   Wait, I missed: U could be at 1, giving U O _ R _.  
   Valid word: U O C R Y – invalid.  
   U O B R T – invalid.  

   Actually, let me re-examine pattern:  
   We know O must be at 2, R must be at 4, and U must appear somewhere.  
   So positions:  
   1: ?  
   2: O  
   3: ?  
   4: R  
   5: ?  
   and U must be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3 [from FLOUR] and not 5 [from FLOUR] – wait, FLOUR had U at 4 and got “-”, so U can’t be at 4.  
   ROUND had U at 3 and got “✓”, then FLOUR had U at 4 and got “-”.

   Let me re-map positions:

   - O is fixed at 2.  
   - U must be at 1, 3, or 5 (positions not yet locked out).  
   - R must be at 3 or 4 (positions not yet locked out).  
   But from FLOUR, R was at 5 and got “-”, so R can’t be at 5.  
   From ROUND, R was at 1 and got “-”, so R can’t be at 1.  
   From AROSE, R was at 2 and got “-”, so R can’t be at 2.  
   Therefore R can only be at 3 or 4.  

   And O is fixed at 2.  

   So possible patterns:
   1. U at 1: U O R _ _ or U O _ R _  
   2. U at 3: _ O U R _  
   3. U at 5: _ O _ R U  

   Let’s explore each:

   1. U O R _ _  
      Need two more letters from unused set.  
      Possible valid word: U O R C H – invalid.  
      U O R G Y – invalid.  
      U O R T H – invalid.  
      U O R M Y – invalid.  

   2. _ O U R _  
      First letter and last letter from unused set.  
      Possible word: C O U R T – “court” is valid.  
      Check constraints:  
      - C unused (ok)  
      - O at 2 (ok)  
      - U at 3 (allowed)  
      - R at 4 (allowed)  
      - T unused (ok)  
      So “COURT” fits.

   3. _ O _ R U  
      First and third letters from unused set.  
      Possible word: C O B R U – invalid.  
      C O P R U – invalid.  
      C O T R U – invalid.  
      T O C R U – invalid.  

   The only valid English word fitting any of these patterns seems to be “COURT”.  
   Check if any letters are ruled out:  
   - C – not ruled out  
   - O – ok  
   - U – ok  
   - R – ok  
   - T – not ruled out  

   Therefore, next guess: COURT.

   Wait, I already used “ROUND” in Guess 2, and COURT was not used yet.

   So let’s go with COURT.

Current constraints:
- O is definitely in position 2.
- R must be somewhere (positions 3 or 4 allowed).
- U must be somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5 allowed).
- Cannot use letters already ruled out: A, S, E, N, D, F, L.

The only common word that satisfies _ O U R _ is “COURT”.
