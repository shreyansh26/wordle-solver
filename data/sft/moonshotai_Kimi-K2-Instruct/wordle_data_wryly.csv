For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. 

A good starting word should include a mix of vowels and consonants, preferably with high-frequency letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are often recommended as they contain many common letters.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so NOT first).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves these confirmed-out letters:
A, I, S, E – cannot appear anywhere.

Remaining high-frequency consonants not yet tested:
T, N, L, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, J, Q (though many are low-frequency).

Remaining high-frequency vowels:
O, U (since A, I, E are out).

We still know the word has an R somewhere (positions 2-5) and none of A, I, S, E.

A good next guess should:
1. Test new common letters.
2. Place the known “R” in new positions to locate it.
3. Check new vowels O and U.

Candidate words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – tests O, U, N, D and moves R.
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) – tests F, O, N, T and keeps R second.
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – tests C, O, N, Y and keeps R second.

ROUND is attractive because it tests two new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (N, D).

However, the R is in position 1 again, and we know R isn’t in position 1. So ROUND’s R is in position 1 (already ruled out).

FRONT keeps R in position 2 (new position) and tests F, O, N, T.

CRONY keeps R in position 2 but introduces C, O, N, Y – C and Y are less common than F and T.

FRONT seems optimal.

Let’s try FRONT.

- Forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, E, F, O, N, T
- Allowed letters: all remaining consonants and the vowels U, Y (since A, I, E, O are out).

We still need three more letters. To maximize information, we should test high-frequency remaining consonants and the remaining vowels.

High-frequency remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, K, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel), and the vowel U.

A good third guess would use three new letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, while keeping R fixed in position 2.

Candidate words with _ R _ _ _ and no forbidden letters:
- DRUMS → uses D, R, U, M, S (but S is forbidden from round 1).
- DRUBS → B and S: S forbidden.
- CRUMP → C, R, U, M, P (C, U, M, P are all allowed and high-frequency).
- GRUMP → G, R, U, M, P.
- CRUMB → C, R, U, M, B.

CRUMB looks good: uses C, U, M, B – all allowed and relatively common, and R is confirmed in position 2.

Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – A, I, S, E are NOT in the word anywhere.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) T(x)
   – R is now in the CORRECT position (position 2).
   – F, O, N, T are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, E, F, O, N, T
- Allowed letters: all remaining consonants and the vowels U, Y (since A, I, E, O are out).

We still need three more letters. To maximize information, we should test high-frequency remaining consonants and the remaining vowels.

High-frequency remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, K, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel), and the vowel U.

A good third guess would use three new letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, while keeping R fixed in position 2.

Candidate words with _ R _ _ _ and no forbidden letters:
- DRUMS → uses D, R, U, M, S (but S is forbidden from round 1).
- DRUBS → B and S: S forbidden.
- CRUMP → C, R, U, M, P (C, U, M, P are all allowed and high-frequency).
- GRUMP → G, R, U, M, P.
- CRUMB → C, R, U, M, B.

CRUMB looks good: uses C, U, M, B – all allowed and relatively common, and R is confirmed in position 2.

Let's check:
- C (consonant, not yet tested)
- R (fixed in position 2, correct)
- U (vowel, not yet tested)
- M (consonant, not yet tested)
- B (consonant, not yet tested)

No forbidden letters appear. This is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. 

A good starting word should include a mix of vowels and consonants, preferably with high-frequency letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are often recommended as they contain many common letters.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so NOT first).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves these confirmed-out letters:
A, I, S, E – cannot appear anywhere.

Remaining high-frequency consonants not yet tested:
T, N, L, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, J, Q (though many are low-frequency).

Remaining high-frequency vowels:
O, U (since A, I, E are out).

We still know the word has an R somewhere (positions 2-5) and none of A, I, S, E.

A good next guess should:
1. Test new common letters.
2. Place the known “R” in new positions to locate it.
3. Check new vowels O and U.

Candidate words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – tests O, U, N, D and moves R.
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) – tests F, O, N, T and keeps R second.
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – tests C, O, N, Y and keeps R second.

ROUND is attractive because it tests two new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (N, D).

However, the R is in position 1 again, and we know R isn’t in position 1. So ROUND’s R is in position 1 (already ruled out).

FRONT keeps R in position 2 (new position) and tests F, O, N, T.

CRONY keeps R in position 2 but introduces C, O, N, Y – C and Y are less common than F and T.

FRONT seems optimal.

Let’s try FRONT.

   – R is now in the CORRECT position (position 2).
   – F, O, N, T are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, E, F, O, N, T
- Allowed letters: all remaining consonants and the vowels U, Y (since A, I, E, O are out).

We still need three more letters. To maximize information, we should test high-frequency remaining consonants and the remaining vowels.

High-frequency remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, K, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel), and the vowel U.

A good third guess would use three new letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, while keeping R fixed in position 2.

Candidate words with _ R _ _ _ and no forbidden letters:
- DRUMS → uses D, R, U, M, S (but S is forbidden from round 1).
- DRUBS → B and S: S forbidden.
- CRUMP → C, R, U, M, P (C, U, M, P are all allowed and high-frequency).
- GRUMP → G, R, U, M, P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. 

A good starting word should include a mix of vowels and consonants, preferably with high-frequency letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are often recommended as they contain many common letters.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so NOT first).
- A, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves these confirmed-out letters:
A, I, S, E – cannot appear anywhere.

Remaining high-frequency consonants not yet tested:
T, N, L, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, J, Q (though many are low-frequency).

Remaining high-frequency vowels:
O, U (since A, I, E are out).

We still know the word has an R somewhere (positions 2-5) and none of A, I, S, E.

A good next guess should:
1. Test new common letters.
2. Place the known “R” in new positions to locate it.
3. Check new vowels O and U.

Candidate words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – tests O, U, N, D and moves R.
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) – tests F, O, N, T and keeps R second.
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – tests C, O, N, Y and keeps R second.

ROUND is attractive because it tests two new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (N, D).

However, the R is in position 1 again, and we know R isn’t in position 1. So ROUND’s R is in position 1 (already ruled out).

FRONT keeps R in position 2 (new position) and tests F, O, N, T.

CRONY keeps R in position 2 but introduces C, O, N, Y – C and Y are less common than F and T.

FRONT seems optimal.

Let’s try FRONT.

<guess>FRONT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FRONT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   – R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – A, I, S, E are NOT in the word anywhere.

2. FRONT → F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(x) T(x)
   – R is now in the CORRECT position (position 2).
   – F, O, N, T are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, E, F, O, N, T
- Allowed letters: all remaining consonants and the vowels U, Y (since A, I, E, O are out).

We still need three more letters. To maximize information, we should test high-frequency remaining consonants and the remaining vowels.

High-frequency remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, K, Y (Y is sometimes a vowel), and the vowel U.

A good third guess would use three new letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, while keeping R fixed in position 2.

Candidate words with _ R _ _ _ and no forbidden letters:
- DRUMS → uses D, R, U, M, S (but S is forbidden from round 1).
- DRUBS → B and S: S forbidden.
- CRUMP → C, R, U, M, P (C, U, M, P are all allowed and high-frequency).
- GRUMP → G, R, U, M, P.
- CRUMB → C, R, U, M, B.

CRUMB looks good: uses C, U, M, B – all allowed and relatively common, and R is confirmed in position 2.

Let's check:
- C (consonant, not yet tested)
- R (fixed in position 2, correct)
- U (vowel, not yet tested)
- M (consonant, not yet tested)
- B (consonant, not yet tested)

No forbidden letters appear. This is a strong next guess.

3. Remaining letters that may appear (positions 1, 3, 4, 5):
   D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   plus the vowel Y (since A, I, E, O, U are out).

Still-common letters in that set: D, G, H, L, P, K, Y (Y acts as vowel).

We need a word that:
- Is 5 letters, R in slot 2.
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Preferably tests several new common letters.

Scanning the dictionary under _ R _ _ _ with no forbidden letters, good candidates are:
- DR?LK, GR?LY, etc.

Concrete words that fit:
- DRILY  (D, R, I, L, Y) – but I is forbidden.
- GRUEL – U is forbidden.
- GRIPY – P, I, Y – I forbidden.
- DRYPE – E forbidden.
- GRYKE – K, Y, E (E forbidden).
- PRYER – E forbidden.
- DRYLY – D, R, Y, L, Y → all allowed!  (Y is allowed, L is allowed)

DRYLY uses:
D (new), Y (new vowel), L (new), and double Y for extra info.
No forbidden letters appear.

   G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  (plus any others not yet ruled out, but L is already in slot 4 feedback so it can’t appear again).

From Guess 4 (DRYLY) we received:
- Position 3: Y ✓
- Position 5: Y ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 2: R ✓
- Position 1: D x → so D is forbidden.

Therefore positions are:
1: any letter not yet forbidden, excluding D
2: R (fixed)
3: Y (fixed)
4: L (fixed)
5: Y (fixed)

So the word must be: ? R Y L Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a letter not in the forbidden set and matches the pattern R Y L Y.

Looking at the remaining candidates, let’s pick a valid letter for position 1 from the unforbidden consonants. The most common remaining are G, H, K, P, etc.
