For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, and ideally includes vowels since every English word has at least one. 

Common letters in 5-letter words include: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. The word ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these highly common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers all major vowels except U. This will help me quickly narrow down which vowels and common consonants are in the secret word, regardless of their positions.

Other good first guesses might include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" provides a nice balance of vowels and consonants while using very frequent letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), E(x) – none of these four letters appear in the secret word.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but not in the 5th (last) position.

So the secret word:
- Definitely contains S, but not as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Letters still available include most consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). To maximize information I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps S in a different position (to confirm where S is).
- Introduces new common letters that remain possible (e.g., T, N, L, I, U, C, etc.).

A strong second guess is “UNTIL”:
- It places U and I (new vowels), N and T (common consonants), and moves S to the 2nd position to test if S belongs there instead.
- None of the already-eliminated letters (A, R, O, E) are reused.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N.
- Letters in the word but whose positions are still being pinned down:
   – S (somewhere, but NOT position 5)
   – T (somewhere, but NOT position 3)
   – I (somewhere, but NOT position 4)
- Letter in the word and already locked in place:
   – L in position 5.

We still need to place S, T, and I, and we can introduce one more new letter (since the word is 5 letters).

A good strategy is to:
1. Keep L fixed in position 5.
2. Put S in position 1 (a common place for S).
3. Put T in position 2 (since position 3 is ruled out for T).
4. Put I in position 3 (since position 4 is ruled out for I).
5. Pick a new consonant for position 4 that hasn’t been tested yet and is common; C is a good choice (common and not eliminated).

That gives us “STICL” – but that’s not a valid 5-letter word.

A valid English word that satisfies these constraints is “STILL”:
- S in position 1 (new placement for S).
- T in position 2 (new placement for T, and position 3 is ruled out for T).
- I in position 3 (new placement for I, and position 4 is ruled out for I).
- Another L in position 4 (allowed even though we already know L is in position 5; the word can have two L’s).
- L locked in position 5.

“STILL” is a valid word and uses all known constraints:
- Uses S, T, I, and places L at the end.
- Doesn’t use any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E, U, N).
