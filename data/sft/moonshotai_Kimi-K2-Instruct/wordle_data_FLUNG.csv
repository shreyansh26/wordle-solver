Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should ideally include a mix of vowels and consonants. 

Common strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a popular starting word that includes very common letters and two vowels (A, E), which can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is in the word and in the correct (second) position.  
- S, A, T, and E are not in the word at all.

Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E.

We now need a word with:
- L in position 2  
- None of S, A, T, E  
- Still cover other frequent consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, C, H, U, M, D, B, G.

A few candidate patterns:
- BL… (B, L, …)  
- CL… (C, L, …)  
- FL… (F, L, …)  
- GL… (G, L, …)

Let’s pick “CLIMB”:
- Uses C, L, I, M, B  
- L stays in place  
- Includes two new vowels (I and no A/E), plus three new consonants (C, M, B)  
- None of the letters are among the already-excluded set (S, A, T, E).

If we get feedback on CLIMB, we’ll have tested five fresh letters while keeping L fixed.

From the feedback so far:

1. Position 2 is L (locked).
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, C, I, M, B, O, R.
3. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but position unknown): F and U.
4. So the pattern is: F L _ _ _  or  _ L F _ _  or  _ L _ F _  or  _ L _ _ F  
   and somewhere we must also place U.

Valid letters left (not yet eliminated): D, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Common ones: D, G, H, K, N, P, W.

We need a real 5-letter English word that:
- Has L in position 2,  
- Contains both F and U,  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible fits:
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) – all letters still allowed  
- FLUMP (but P and M: M already ruled out) – invalid  
- FLONG (no U) – invalid  
- FLUYD – not a standard word  
- FLUNG (F, L, U, N, G) – all letters still allowed

Between FLUNK and FLUNG, both test fresh consonants. FLUNK tests K; FLUNG tests G. Either is fine.

I’ll pick FLUNG.
