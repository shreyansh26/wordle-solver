For the first guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.
2. Avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

The classic first guess ""SLATE"" is good, but ""CRANE"" is also highly recommended as it covers very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has no repeats. Another strong contender is ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for elimination.

From the feedback:

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word (from guess 1 & 2): C, R, A, E, S, O  
Letters known to be in the word but positions still unknown: N, U  
Letter known to be in the word and in the exact 5th position: D

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ D  
and the remaining letters include N and U somewhere in positions 1-4.

We have used up 10 distinct letters already. To maximize information in the next guess, we should pick a word that:
- Contains N and U (but not in their previously guessed positions, 3 and 4 respectively)
- Contains new letters we have not yet tried
- Ends in D

Let’s list the unused common consonants and vowels:
Unused consonants: T, L, H, M, B, G, F, etc.  
Unused vowels: I (only vowel left)

A good candidate is “HUMID”:
- H, U, M, I, D
- Contains U (will test it in position 2), N is still missing here, but I’ll deliberately leave N out for now to check more new letters (H, M, I).
- Ends in D, satisfying the known last-letter constraint.
- Introduces three new letters (H, M, I).

While leaving N out risks a miss, it gives maximum information on the remaining frequent letters.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, O, H, M  
Letters known to be in the word:  
- I in position 4 (✓)  
- D in position 5 (✓)  
- U (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 3)  
- N (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4)

So the word has the pattern: _ _ _ I D  
and must contain both U and N somewhere in positions 1-3.

Possible slotting of U and N into the first three positions:

1. U N _ I D  
2. U _ N I D  
3. N U _ I D  
4. N _ U I D  
5. _ N U I D  
6. _ U N I D

Let’s test candidate words:

1. UN_I D  → missing 3rd letter must be valid. UNBID, UNLID, UNKID?

2. U_N_I D → U N _ I D already covered above.

5. _ N U I D → F N U I D? Invalid. T N U I D? Invalid.

6. _ U N I D → B U N I D? Invalid. T U N I D? Invalid.

The only valid word fitting the patterns above is UNBID.

It satisfies:
- U N _ I D  
- Contains U and N  
- Uses only allowed letters B, I, D, U, N  
- I and D are in the correct positions as per feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.
2. Avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

The classic first guess ""SLATE"" is good, but ""CRANE"" is also highly recommended as it covers very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has no repeats. Another strong contender is ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage for elimination.

3. Uses fresh letters to gain more information.

Letter known to be in the word and in the exact 5th position: D

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ D  
and the remaining letters include N and U somewhere in positions 1-4.

We have used up 10 distinct letters already. To maximize information in the next guess, we should pick a word that:
- Contains N and U (but not in their previously guessed positions, 3 and 4 respectively)
- Contains new letters we have not yet tried
- Ends in D

Let’s list the unused common consonants and vowels:
Unused consonants: T, L, H, M, B, G, F, etc.  
Unused vowels: I (only vowel left)

A good candidate is “HUMID”:
- H, U, M, I, D
- Contains U (will test it in position 2), N is still missing here, but I’ll deliberately leave N out for now to check more new letters (H, M, I).
- Ends in D, satisfying the known last-letter constraint.
- Introduces three new letters (H, M, I).

While leaving N out risks a miss, it gives maximum information on the remaining frequent letters.

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(x) U(-) N(-) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word (from guess 1 & 2): C, R, A, E, S, O  
Letters known to be in the word but positions still unknown: N, U  
Letter known to be in the word and in the exact 5th position: D

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ D  
and the remaining letters include N and U somewhere in positions 1-4.

We have used up 10 distinct letters already. To maximize information in the next guess, we should pick a word that:
- Contains N and U (but not in their previously guessed positions, 3 and 4 respectively)
- Contains new letters we have not yet tried
- Ends in D

Let’s list the unused common consonants and vowels:
Unused consonants: T, L, H, M, B, G, F, etc.  
Unused vowels: I (only vowel left)

A good candidate is “HUMID”:
- H, U, M, I, D
- Contains U (will test it in position 2), N is still missing here, but I’ll deliberately leave N out for now to check more new letters (H, M, I).
- Ends in D, satisfying the known last-letter constraint.
- Introduces three new letters (H, M, I).

While leaving N out risks a miss, it gives maximum information on the remaining frequent letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, O, H, M  
Letters known to be in the word:  
- I in position 4 (✓)  
- D in position 5 (✓)  
- U (must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 3)  
- N (must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4)

So the word has the pattern: _ _ _ I D  
and must contain both U and N somewhere in positions 1-3.

Possible slotting of U and N into the first three positions:

1. U N _ I D  
2. U _ N I D  
3. N U _ I D  
4. N _ U I D  
5. _ N U I D  
6. _ U N I D  

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns and uses only letters we have not ruled out.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, I, K, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, D (but I, N, U, D already placed).

Let’s test candidate words:

1. UN_I D  → missing 3rd letter must be valid. UNBID, UNLID, UNKID?  
   - UNBID is a valid word (meaning to retract a bid).

2. U_N_I D → U N _ I D already covered above.  
   - Other placements must fit.

3. NU_I D  → N U _ I D → NUBID? Not a word. NUPID? No. NUGID? No.  
   NULID? Not a word.

4. N_U_I D → N _ U I D → N T U I D? Invalid. N P U I D? Invalid.

5. _ N U I D → F N U I D? Invalid. T N U I D? Invalid.

6. _ U N I D → B U N I D? Invalid. T U N I D? Invalid.

The only valid word fitting the patterns above is UNBID.

It satisfies:
- U N _ I D  
- Contains U and N  
- Uses only allowed letters B, I, D, U, N  
- I and D are in the correct positions as per feedback.

Therefore, the next logical guess is UNBID.

- N is in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- B is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the correct 4th position (✓)
- D is in the correct 5th position (✓)

So the pattern is already fully determined: U N _ I D, and the 3rd letter is the only unknown. The letters already confirmed are U, N, I, D. The 3rd letter must be one we have not eliminated yet.

Letters eliminated so far include: C, R, A, E, S, O, H, M, B.

Remaining unused common letters: F, G, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern U N _ I D and uses one of these remaining letters.

Let's check possible choices:

- U N F I D → valid word? No such word in English.
- U N G I D → valid word? No.
- U N K I D → valid word? No.
- U N L I D → valid word? Yes, ""UNLID"" is a valid word meaning to remove the lid.
- U N P I D → no.
- U N T I D → no.
- U N V I D → no.
- U N W I D → no.
- U N Y I D → no.

The only valid word left that fits is UNLID.
