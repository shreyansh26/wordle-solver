1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This word will help me quickly determine which of these frequently used letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

- O is somewhere in the word (but not position 3).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Common remaining letters to try: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good first follow-up guess would use common consonants plus the known O, while avoiding the eliminated letters. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T – none of the eliminated letters, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is present but NOT in position 3.  
   – A, R, S, E are completely absent.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(✓)  
   – P is in the correct position (position 1).  
   – T is in the correct position (position 5).  
   – O is present but NOT in position 2.  
   – I is present but NOT in position 3.  
   – N is absent.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: P _ _ _ T  
- Must contain O and I (but O and I must appear in the remaining open positions, 2 or 4).  
- Cannot contain A, R, S, E, N.

We need five-letter words that:
- Start with P, end with T.  
- Contain both O and I somewhere in the middle three positions (positions 2, 3, 4).  
- Do not use A, R, S, E, N.

Let’s list possible middle letters that are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but realistically only common ones).

Possible combinations:
- P I O _ T → PIOLT (invalid)  
- P O I _ T → POI_T (need a letter) → POILT (invalid)  
- P _ I O T → P I O T… but position 3 I is ruled out from POINT feedback.  
- P _ O I T → P O I T… position 2 O is ruled out from POINT feedback.

Wait, we know:
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3 (it was position 2 in POINT and got “-”, and it was position 3 in AROSE and got “-”).  
  Therefore, O must be in position 4!  
- Similarly, I cannot be in position 3, so I must be in position 2.

So the pattern is: P I _ O T, with position 3 still unknown.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form P I _ O T.

Looking up, the only common word that fits PI_OT is:
