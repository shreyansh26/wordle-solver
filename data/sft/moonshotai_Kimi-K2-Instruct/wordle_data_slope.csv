For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. After analyzing letter frequencies, I've determined that the most common letters in English (in order) are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first guess should include as many of these high-frequency letters as possible while avoiding duplicate letters to maximize coverage. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as an excellent first guess because it includes 5 of the top 7 most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has no repeating letters. Other good options would be ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" gives us a great balance of vowels and consonants.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess to efficiently narrow down the possible word pool.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word
- A: x → not in the word
- I: x → not in the word
- S: - → in the word but wrong position (cannot be in position 4)
- E: ✓ → in the word and in position 5 (last letter)

So the secret word ends in E, contains S somewhere other than position 4, and does **not** contain R, A, or I.

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, O, D, U, Y, H, M, etc.

To cover new high-frequency letters and confirm positions, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps E fixed in position 5,
- puts S in a different place (ideally 1, 2, or 3),
- uses new common consonants and vowels,
- avoids R, A, I.

The word **STONE** fits:
- S (moved to 1),
- T, O, N new,
- E locked in 5,
- no R/A/I.

We now know:
- Letters fixed in the correct spots: S _ O _ E
- Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, T, N
- Remaining letters we should test: common consonants like D, L, C, M, P, Y, H, etc.

The blanks are at positions 2 and 4.  
We need two new letters that:
– have not been ruled out yet,  
– fit together in a plausible 5-letter word of the form S _ O _ E.

Try every common consonant in position 2 and 4:

Possible middle consonants: P, L, D, C, M, Y, H, etc.

Quick mental check:
- SPORE – good use of P and R, but R is already excluded.
- SLOPE – uses L and P; both letters are still allowed.
- SCOPE – uses C and P; both allowed.
- SMOTE – uses M and T, but T is excluded.
- SHONE – uses H and N, but N is excluded.

Among these, “SLOPE” seems clean and common, and it introduces two new letters (L and P) we haven’t tested.
