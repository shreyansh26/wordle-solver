This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, N, L. A good first guess should use a mix of these to cover as much ground as possible. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives a high chance of at least one letter being correct or present in the word.

All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked with an ""x"", which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates those five common letters and shrinks the remaining alphabet considerably.  
For the next guess we should therefore use letters that are still possible.  
Good consonants left include: T, N, L, C, B, M, P, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y.  
Good vowels left include: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).  

A balanced word that uses several of the still-available high-frequency letters is ""UNTIL"":  
- U and I are the two remaining common vowels.  
- N, T, L are frequent consonants.  
This gives us fresh coverage across the board without repeating any of the already-eliminated letters.

Current constraints from all feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, D, G, Y  
2. Letters known to be in the word (positions unknown): U, N  
3. Confirmed positions: none yet.

So the secret word must contain both U and N, and consist only of the still-allowed letters:  
B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus U and N.

We need a 5-letter word that uses U and N (not yet in their final positions) and fresh remaining letters.  
Looking at common patterns, possible consonant clusters with these letters could be:  
""CH"", ""CK"", ""MP"", ""NK"", ""UM"", ""UN"", ""UB"", ""UC"", etc.

A balanced candidate that repositions U and N and introduces two new consonants that haven’t been ruled out is “HUNKY”:

- H: still allowed  
- U: move U to position 2 (it was position 2 in DUNGY, so try position 3 or 4 now) – wait: in DUNGY U was position 2 and was correct, so U must be position 2.  
- N: move N away from position 3 (it was position 3 in DUNGY and correct) – so N must be position 3.  
But that would duplicate positions. Let me reread:

Feedback for DUNGY:  
D(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(x)

This means:  
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- D, G, Y are not in the word at all.

Therefore the pattern is _ U N _ _ with letters only from the still-allowed set.

Still-allowed letters (excluding the 11 eliminated letters):  
B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.

Common endings or starts:  
- CHUNK (but C, H allowed)  
- BUNKO – but O is out  
- BUNKS – S is out  
- FUNKS – S, F allowed, but S out  
- HUNKY – but Y is out  
- MUNCH – C, H allowed  
- PUNCH – C, H allowed

The word must be _ U N _ _ with letters only from the allowed set.

Candidate words:  
- B U N K _ – BUNK? (4 letters)  
- B U N K + one more letter: BUNKY (Y out), BUNKS (S out) – no.  
- C H U N K – but U must be position 2, so C H U N K doesn’t fit _ U N _ _.  
- F U N K – (4 letters)  
- H U N K – (4 letters)  
- M U N C H – but that’s M U N C H, positions 1-5, with U in 2 and N in 3 – correct. All letters allowed: M, U, N, C, H are all still possible.  
- P U N C H – P, U, N, C, H all allowed.

Between MUNCH and PUNCH both fit perfectly.  
Both are common English words. MUNCH seems slightly more distinctive; let’s choose MUNCH.

Check positions:
M (position 1) – not yet ruled out.  
U is fixed at position 2 (correct from feedback).  
N is fixed at position 3 (correct from feedback).  
C (position 4) – not ruled out.  
H (position 5) – not ruled out.

So MUNCH fits all constraints.
