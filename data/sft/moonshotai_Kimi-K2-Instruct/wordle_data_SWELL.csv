For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me information about common letters and positions. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting something in the secret word
2. Include vowels to test common vowel positions
3. Have distinct letters to avoid duplicate confusion

Popular good starting words include:
- CRANE (common consonants, 3 vowels)
- SLATE (similar reasoning)
- ADIEU (many vowels)
- RAISE (common letters)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R (common consonants)

- N (another common letter)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, B, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but in wrong positions so far: E, L, W

Positions of E so far:
- Guess 1 (CRANE) – E in position 5 → wrong spot  
- Guess 2 (ELBOW) – E in position 1 → wrong spot  

Therefore E can only sit in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Positions of L so far:
- Guess 2 – L in position 2 → wrong spot

Positions of W so far:
- Guess 2 – W in position 5 → wrong spot

Next word must:
- Include E, L, W  
- Place each of them in still-open positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, N, B, O)

Available consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: I, U (since A, O are out)

To fit E, L, W into a fresh arrangement, one simple pattern is to anchor E in position 3 and build around it.

Try: D _ E _ _  
We need L and W in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding their previously shown spots.

Option: L in 1, W in 4 → L _ E W _  
Need a legal consonant for position 2.  H, S, T are common.

Word “LTEWK” – invalid.

Try another arrangement: W in 1, E in 3, L in 4 → W _ E L _

Testing: WHEEL has W in 1 (new), E in 3 (new), E in 4 (new), L in 4 clashes; also L needs to be not in 2.

Better: W in 2, E in 3, L in 4 → _ W E L _

S in 1, D in 5 → SWELD – not a word.  
P in 1, K in 5 → PWELK – invalid.  
D in 1, S in 5 → DWELS – “dwell” is a word but needs two L’s, so skip.

- S (common)
- T (common)
- O (vowel)
- I (vowel)
- C (but C is out, so skip)

""LODGE"" uses:
- L
- O
- D
- G
- E (in position 5, but E can't be in position 5, so skip)

""THOSE"" uses:
- T
- H
- O
- S
- E (position 5, same problem)

""BEIGE"" uses B, E, I, G, E – but has two E's and R is out.

""EDICT"" has C and T, but C is out.

""ELBOW"" has B, but no C, R, A, N – and E in position 1.

""ELBOW"" looks good:
- E in position 1
- L, B, O, W are new letters
- No excluded letters

Let's go with ELBOW.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ELBOW -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, B, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but in wrong positions so far: E, L, W

Positions of E so far:
- Guess 1 (CRANE) – E in position 5 → wrong spot  
- Guess 2 (ELBOW) – E in position 1 → wrong spot  

Therefore E can only sit in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Positions of L so far:
- Guess 2 – L in position 2 → wrong spot

Positions of W so far:
- Guess 2 – W in position 5 → wrong spot

Next word must:
- Include E, L, W  
- Place each of them in still-open positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, N, B, O)

Available consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: I, U (since A, O are out)

To fit E, L, W into a fresh arrangement, one simple pattern is to anchor E in position 3 and build around it.

Try: D _ E _ _  
We need L and W in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding their previously shown spots.

Option: L in 1, W in 4 → L _ E W _  
Need a legal consonant for position 2.  H, S, T are common.

Word “LHEWK” – invalid.  
Word “LSEWK” – invalid.  
Word “LTEWK” – invalid.

Try another arrangement: W in 1, E in 3, L in 4 → W _ E L _  
Fill with legal consonant: WHEEL – contains E twice, but we do not yet know if duplicates are allowed.  
Testing: WHEEL has W in 1 (new), E in 3 (new), E in 4 (new), L in 4 clashes; also L needs to be not in 2.

Better: W in 2, E in 3, L in 4 → _ W E L _  
Insert a legal consonant at 1 and 5.

S in 1, D in 5 → SWELD – not a word.  
P in 1, K in 5 → PWELK – invalid.  
D in 1, S in 5 → DWELS – “dwell” is a word but needs two L’s, so skip.

Try W in 4, E in 3, L in 1 → L _ E W _  
Again: LVEWK – invalid.

Another pattern: place E in 2, L in 4, W in 3 → _ E W L _  
Insert legal letters: M E W L S – “MEWLS” is valid.  Let’s use that.

From the three guesses so far we have:

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, O, M, S  
Included letters (but in wrong positions): E, W, L  
Included letter (and in correct position): L in position 4

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L _

Positions already ruled out:
- E: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 4, but position 4 is L → contradiction?
Wait, let's list where each confirmed letter has been tried:

E:
- CRANE: position 5 → wrong
- ELBOW: position 1 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 2 → wrong
So E must be in position 3 or 4. But position 4 is L (confirmed), so E must be in position 3.

W:
- ELBOW: position 5 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 3 → wrong
So W must be in position 1, 2 or 4. Position 4 is L, so W is in 1 or 2.

L:
- ELBOW: position 2 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 4 → correct (✓)
So L is fixed in position 4.

Current known structure:
Positions: 1   2   3   4   5
Letters:   ?   ?   E   L   ?

But we saw W must be in position 1 or 2, and we need one more letter (position 5) that hasn't been excluded.

Available letters: all except C,R,A,N,B,O,M,S and duplicates of E,W,L (but we don't know about duplicates yet)

Let's try placing W in position 2:
? W E L ?

For position 1 and 5, we need letters from remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
And we need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ W E L _

Looking at common words: ""DWELL"" - but L is already in position 4, can't have two L's unless duplicates allowed, but position 3 is E, so D-W-E-L-L would have L in 4 and 5. ""DWELT"" - T is available. ""SWELL"" - S excluded. ""TWELP"" - not a word. ""GWELP"" - no. ""FWELK"" - no.

Try W in position 1: W _ E L _

Then positions 2 and 5 need letters: W H E L P (""WHELP"") is a valid word.

Let's check:
- Letters: W, H, E, L, P
- H and P are new and not excluded
- Positions:
  - W: position 1 (new spot, allowed)
  - E: position 3 (must be here)
  - L: position 4 (confirmed)
This satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting something in the secret word
2. Include vowels to test common vowel positions

- RAISE (common letters)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R (common consonants)

- N (another common letter)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

5. E – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:

- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely
- Use other common consonants and vowels

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

I'll try a word that moves E to position 3 and introduces new common letters:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SWELL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me information about common letters and positions. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting something in the secret word
2. Include vowels to test common vowel positions
3. Have distinct letters to avoid duplicate confusion

Popular good starting words include:
- CRANE (common consonants, 3 vowels)
- SLATE (similar reasoning)
- ADIEU (many vowels)
- RAISE (common letters)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (another common letter)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (CRANE) we learned:

1. C – not in the word (x)
2. R – not in the word (x)
3. A – not in the word (x)
4. N – not in the word (x)
5. E – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N
- DOES contain E, but not in position 5

Next guess should:
- Include E in a different position
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely
- Use other common consonants and vowels

Good remaining consonants: T, S, L, D, B, G, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

I'll try a word that moves E to position 3 and introduces new common letters:
- S, T, O, I, D, etc.

""STOIC"" uses:
- S (common)
- T (common)
- O (vowel)
- I (vowel)
- C (but C is out, so skip)

""LODGE"" uses:
- L
- O
- D
- G
- E (in position 5, but E can't be in position 5, so skip)

""THOSE"" uses:
- T
- H
- O
- S
- E (position 5, same problem)

""BEIGE"" uses B, E, I, G, E – but has two E's and R is out.

""EDICT"" has C and T, but C is out.

""ELBOW"" has B, but no C, R, A, N – and E in position 1.

""ELBOW"" looks good:
- E in position 1
- L, B, O, W are new letters
- No excluded letters

Let's go with ELBOW.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, B, O  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but in wrong positions so far: E, L, W

Positions of E so far:
- Guess 1 (CRANE) – E in position 5 → wrong spot  
- Guess 2 (ELBOW) – E in position 1 → wrong spot  

Therefore E can only sit in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Positions of L so far:
- Guess 2 – L in position 2 → wrong spot

Positions of W so far:
- Guess 2 – W in position 5 → wrong spot

Next word must:
- Include E, L, W  
- Place each of them in still-open positions  
- Use only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, N, B, O)

Available consonants: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: I, U (since A, O are out)

To fit E, L, W into a fresh arrangement, one simple pattern is to anchor E in position 3 and build around it.

Try: D _ E _ _  
We need L and W in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding their previously shown spots.

Option: L in 1, W in 4 → L _ E W _  
Need a legal consonant for position 2.  H, S, T are common.

Word “LHEWK” – invalid.  
Word “LSEWK” – invalid.  
Word “LTEWK” – invalid.

Try another arrangement: W in 1, E in 3, L in 4 → W _ E L _  
Fill with legal consonant: WHEEL – contains E twice, but we do not yet know if duplicates are allowed.  
Testing: WHEEL has W in 1 (new), E in 3 (new), E in 4 (new), L in 4 clashes; also L needs to be not in 2.

Better: W in 2, E in 3, L in 4 → _ W E L _  
Insert a legal consonant at 1 and 5.

S in 1, D in 5 → SWELD – not a word.  
P in 1, K in 5 → PWELK – invalid.  
D in 1, S in 5 → DWELS – “dwell” is a word but needs two L’s, so skip.

Try W in 4, E in 3, L in 1 → L _ E W _  
Again: LVEWK – invalid.

Another pattern: place E in 2, L in 4, W in 3 → _ E W L _  
Insert legal letters: M E W L S – “MEWLS” is valid.  Let’s use that.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses so far we have:

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, O, M, S  
Included letters (but in wrong positions): E, W, L  
Included letter (and in correct position): L in position 4

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L _

Positions already ruled out:
- E: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → must be in position 4, but position 4 is L → contradiction?
Wait, let's list where each confirmed letter has been tried:

E:
- CRANE: position 5 → wrong
- ELBOW: position 1 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 2 → wrong
So E must be in position 3 or 4. But position 4 is L (confirmed), so E must be in position 3.

W:
- ELBOW: position 5 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 3 → wrong
So W must be in position 1, 2 or 4. Position 4 is L, so W is in 1 or 2.

L:
- ELBOW: position 2 → wrong
- MEWLS: position 4 → correct (✓)
So L is fixed in position 4.

Current known structure:
Positions: 1   2   3   4   5
Letters:   ?   ?   E   L   ?

But we saw W must be in position 1 or 2, and we need one more letter (position 5) that hasn't been excluded.

Available letters: all except C,R,A,N,B,O,M,S and duplicates of E,W,L (but we don't know about duplicates yet)

Let's try placing W in position 2:
? W E L ?

For position 1 and 5, we need letters from remaining pool: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
And we need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ W E L _

Looking at common words: ""DWELL"" - but L is already in position 4, can't have two L's unless duplicates allowed, but position 3 is E, so D-W-E-L-L would have L in 4 and 5. ""DWELT"" - T is available. ""SWELL"" - S excluded. ""TWELP"" - not a word. ""GWELP"" - no. ""FWELK"" - no.

Try W in position 1: W _ E L _

Then positions 2 and 5 need letters: W H E L P (""WHELP"") is a valid word.

Let's check:
- Letters: W, H, E, L, P
- H and P are new and not excluded
- Positions:
  - W: position 1 (new spot, allowed)
  - E: position 3 (must be here)
  - L: position 4 (confirmed)
This satisfies all constraints.

1. Locked letters so far:

2. Eliminated letters (x or ✓ elsewhere):

3. Confirmed present but still misplaced: W
   - Has appeared in positions 1, 3, 5 and always “-”.  
   - Allowed positions left for W: 2 (only remaining slot).

4. Therefore the word must be:
   _ W E L _

5. Allowed remaining letters for positions 1 & 5:  
   From the alphabet minus the eliminated set:  
   F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

6. Scan common English words fitting “? W E L ?”:
   - T W E L ?  → “TWELP” – invalid  
   - F W E L ?  → “FWELK” – invalid  
   - G W E L ?  → “GWELK” – invalid  
   - K W E L ?  → “KWELT” – invalid

   Only real candidate: “T W E L T”  → “TWELT” not standard  
   Wait—there is a common word “DWELT” but D is excluded.  
   Rechecking remaining consonants:

   F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z  
   None form a valid 5-letter English word with “WEL” in the middle.

   However, “KVELL” is a recognized English word meaning “to feel happy and proud” and fits the pattern K W E L L.  
   But L is already fixed in position 4, so duplicate L would have to be allowed; we don’t have evidence against duplicates yet.

   Another look: the only plausible candidate fitting the pattern with remaining letters is “KVELL”.  
   Let’s verify:  
   positions: K(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) L(5)  
   - K and the second L are new letters not yet excluded.  
   - It satisfies all constraints.
