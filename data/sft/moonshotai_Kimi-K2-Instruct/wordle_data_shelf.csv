For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A strategic first guess would include a good mix of vowels and common consonants. Good candidates include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, AROSE covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), making it an excellent first guess to quickly identify which letters are or aren't in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the hidden word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S and E (and possibly other letters) while avoiding A, R, O.  
Since S’s position was 4 and E’s was 5, I’ll put them elsewhere.

Trying a word that reuses S and E in new spots and adds common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out:  
- D, I, N, T, L, U, C, etc. are still possible.

A good candidate:  
STEIN – but T is common and it uses S and E in new positions (S-1, T-2, E-3, I-4, N-5).  

But wait, STEIN has S in position 1 and E in position 3, which are different from the original feedback (S was position 4, E was position 5). This respects the “wrong position” clue.

Another check: no A, R, O in STEIN – good.

Confirmed positions:
- S is fixed at position 1.

Eliminated letters (so far):
A, R, O, T, I, N, P, C, K

Still-allowed letters (common ones first):
B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need two more letters to fill S _ E _ _ from the allowed set, without repeating any used letters.

Possible patterns:
S _ E _ _

Possible second letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y  
Possible fourth letters: same list, excluding the one used in position 2.

Let’s list a few valid words:
- S H E L F – but F is allowed.
- S M E L T – T is eliminated.
- S W E L L – L repeats, but is allowed as long as the word itself is valid.
- S L E D S – S repeats, but is allowed.
- S H E L F – valid, letters H, L, F not eliminated.
- S M E L T – T eliminated.
- S G E T S – G, E, T, S but T is eliminated.
- S W E E T – T eliminated and E repeats.
- S L E E K – K eliminated.
- S L E P T – P and T eliminated.

Next valid word: S H E L F – all letters allowed and fit the pattern.

But let’s look for a word that fills the two blanks without using any eliminated letters: S _ E _ _

Another candidate: S U E D E – E repeats, D is allowed.
But we want to test new letters efficiently.

Another candidate: S W E E T – T eliminated.
Another: S M E L T – T eliminated.

Another: S U E D E – D and E, but E is already confirmed.

Another: S U E G E – not a valid word.

Valid word: S U E D E – but has two E’s and D is allowed.

But we want to test new letters in positions 2 and 4.

Valid words fitting S _ E _ _:
- S H E L F
- S U E D E
- S W E L L
- S M E L T (invalid, T eliminated)
- S G E L T (invalid)
- S B E L T (invalid)
- S F E L T (invalid)

The best candidate seems S H E L F – uses H, L, F (all new, not ruled out).

Let me check:
S H E L F – letters: S, H, E, L, F
- S and E already confirmed correct positions.
- H, L, F have not been tested yet and are not ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess is SHELF.
