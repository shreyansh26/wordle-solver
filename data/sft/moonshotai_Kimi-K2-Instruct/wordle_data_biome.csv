For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly gather information about which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended for this purpose as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good initial feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E  (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as O and E)
- Already-eliminated letters: A, R, S, C, H, K
- We need two new consonants or vowels to fill positions 1 and 4
- Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Good next candidates should use fresh letters, especially ones that appear frequently in 5-letter words. A high-value set is {D, I, N, T}. I’ll choose the word “PHONE”:
- P – new
- H – already ruled out (from CHOKE), so this is bad.  
Let me pick something else.

Next candidate: “DOWNE”
- D – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- N – new
- E – locked  
But this uses W, which is less common. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P – new
- O – locked
- I – new
- N – new
- T – new  
And it keeps O in position 3 while we still need position 5 to be E, so T can’t go there. 

A better choice respecting the pattern _ _ O _ E:
“DONKE” – but K is out.
“MOUSE” – S is out.
“TONNE” – N repeated, T new.
“VOICE” – C is out.
“BOONE” – B new, O locked, O repeated, N new, E locked. Two O’s are allowed if it’s the secret word (e.g., “BOOZE”), but we don’t know. Let’s go with “BOONE.”

But “BOONE” has two O’s, and we only know one O is confirmed in position 3. Let’s try “MONEY.”
- M – new
- O – locked
- N – new
- E – locked, must be in position 5
- Y – new
Pattern: M O N E Y → but that would put E in position 4, which violates the known position.  

Revise: positions 3 and 5 must be O and E respectively, so we need _ _ O _ E. A good word is “BLOKE” (but K is out). How about “TOWER”?
- T – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- E – locked must be in 5, but here it’s in 4 – not matching.  

Correct pattern: _ _ O _ E. Let me choose “DONNE” (but N repeated). “FOGLE” – G and L new. Wait, “FOGLE” ends with E in 5, has O in 3, and F/G/L are new.  

I’ll go with “FOGLE.”
But “FOGLE” doesn’t fit pattern _ _ O _ E. Let me list a few valid words that match _ _ O _ E and use only allowed letters:

- DOWNE – W not great

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ _ _ O _ E  (positions 3 and 5 fixed)

2. CHOKE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ confirms positions 3 & 5, eliminates C, H, K

3. BOOZE → B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)
   - B(✓) means B is correct at position 1: B _ O _ E
   - O(-) for the second O means that second O is in the word but in the wrong position; however position 3 already has O, so the word must contain an additional O somewhere else.
   - Z(x) ⇒ no Z
   - Letters we know so far: B, O, E
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, S, C, H, K, Z

Thus the pattern must be:
B _ O _ E  (with a second O somewhere in positions 2 or 4)

Possible second-O placements:
- B O O _ E  → positions 2 and 3
- B _ O O E  → positions 3 and 4

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that fit either:
- B O O _ E  → “BOOKE” (invalid, K out), “BOOGE” (invalid), “BOOLE” (name), “BOONE” (name, N allowed)
- B _ O O E  → “BROOE” (no), “BLOOE” (no), “BHOOE” (no) – none seem valid.

Only plausible dictionary word is “BOONE” (though it’s a proper noun it’s accepted in Wordle lists). But we already used BOOZE, so let’s check:

Letters to test: D, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Looking for B _ O _ E with an extra O:
B O O N E – “BOONE”
B O O S E – S out
B O O T E – “BOOTE” uncommon
B O O P E – invalid
B L O O E – invalid
B N O O E – invalid

“BOONE” is the only candidate, but we need to make sure N and the second O are fresh. N is fresh (never used). So “BOONE” fits perfectly with the pattern and feedback.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,biome,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – in the word and in the right spot (position 3)
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – in the word and in the right spot (position 5)

So the secret word has:
- _ _ O _ E
- Cannot contain A, R, S
- Contains O in position 3 and E in position 5

Next, I should pick a word that keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5, and introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Good letters to try next: T, N, L, D, I, U, M, etc.

A word that fits this pattern and introduces several new letters is “CHOKE.”
- C(edges out) – new
- H – new
- O – in position 3 (✓)
- K – new
- E – in position 5 (✓)

Let’s try CHOKE.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E  (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as O and E)
- Already-eliminated letters: A, R, S, C, H, K
- We need two new consonants or vowels to fill positions 1 and 4
- Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Good next candidates should use fresh letters, especially ones that appear frequently in 5-letter words. A high-value set is {D, I, N, T}. I’ll choose the word “PHONE”:
- P – new
- H – already ruled out (from CHOKE), so this is bad.  
Let me pick something else.

Next candidate: “DOWNE”
- D – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- N – new
- E – locked  
But this uses W, which is less common. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P – new
- O – locked
- I – new
- N – new
- T – new  
And it keeps O in position 3 while we still need position 5 to be E, so T can’t go there. 

A better choice respecting the pattern _ _ O _ E:
“DONKE” – but K is out.
“MOUSE” – S is out.
“TONNE” – N repeated, T new.
“VOICE” – C is out.
“BOONE” – B new, O locked, O repeated, N new, E locked. Two O’s are allowed if it’s the secret word (e.g., “BOOZE”), but we don’t know. Let’s go with “BOONE.”

But “BOONE” has two O’s, and we only know one O is confirmed in position 3. Let’s try “MONEY.”
- M – new
- O – locked
- N – new
- E – locked, must be in position 5
- Y – new
Pattern: M O N E Y → but that would put E in position 4, which violates the known position.  

Revise: positions 3 and 5 must be O and E respectively, so we need _ _ O _ E. A good word is “BLOKE” (but K is out). How about “TOWER”?
- T – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- E – locked must be in 5, but here it’s in 4 – not matching.  

Correct pattern: _ _ O _ E. Let me choose “DONNE” (but N repeated). “FOGLE” – G and L new. Wait, “FOGLE” ends with E in 5, has O in 3, and F/G/L are new.  

I’ll go with “FOGLE.”
But “FOGLE” doesn’t fit pattern _ _ O _ E. Let me list a few valid words that match _ _ O _ E and use only allowed letters:

- DOWNE – W not great
- GONNE – G new, N new, G/N allowed
- TONNE – T new, N new
- VOGUE – V new, G new, U new
- LOOSE – S is out
- POOLE – P new, L new
- MOOSE – S out
- GOOSE – S out
- HOOVE – H out
- BOOZE – Z new, B new

3. BOOZE → B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)
   - B(✓) means B is correct at position 1: B _ O _ E
   - O(-) for the second O means that second O is in the word but in the wrong position; however position 3 already has O, so the word must contain an additional O somewhere else.
   - Z(x) ⇒ no Z
   - Letters we know so far: B, O, E
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, S, C, H, K, Z

Thus the pattern must be:
B _ O _ E  (with a second O somewhere in positions 2 or 4)

Possible second-O placements:
- B O O _ E  → positions 2 and 3
- B _ O O E  → positions 3 and 4

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that fit either:

B O O T E – “BOOTE” uncommon
B O O P E – invalid

So far we have:

Pattern: B _ O _ E  (B at position 1, O at 3, E at 5)  
Known letters: B, O, E  
Eliminated letters: A, R, S, C, H, K, Z, N  

The second O (from BOOZE and BOONE) must appear somewhere other than position 3, so it must be in position 2 or 4.

Two possible patterns:
1. B O O _ E  (positions 2 and 3 both O)
2. B _ O O E  (positions 3 and 4 both O)

Let’s look for valid 5-letter English words meeting either pattern, using only allowed letters (not A, R, S, C, H, K, Z, N).

Pattern 1: B O O _ E  
Possible endings: F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  
Checking: BOOGE (no), BOOLE (name), BOOME (no), BOOPE (no), BOOTE (uncommon), BOOVE (no) – nothing standard.

Pattern 2: B _ O O E  
Possible second letters: D, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  
Valid words: B L O O E (no), B D O O E (no), B F O O E (no), B G O O E (no), B I O O E (no), B M O O E (no), B P O O E (no), B T O O E (no), B U O O E (no), B V O O E (no), B W O O E (no), B Y O O E (no) – none valid.

Wait, let’s re-examine: is there any standard word fitting B _ O _ E with an extra O elsewhere? The only standard word that fits B _ O _ E and contains a second O is actually “BOOGE” (slang), but G is allowed. However, English 5-letter word “BOOGE” is not standard.

Realizing: the word must be “BOOZE” but Z is out. So let me reconsider: maybe the extra O is in position 2, giving B O O _ E. The only common word fitting is “BOOGE” but let’s try “BOOGE”.

But we need a fresh guess. The only remaining possible word seems “BOOGE” or perhaps we missed something. Actually, checking word lists, a valid word is “BOOGE” but another possibility is “BOOPE” (no). Realizing we might have missed “BOOUE” or similar, but none standard.

Wait – let me step back: the word must be B _ O _ E with an extra O. The only remaining possibility is the word “BOOGE” but this is not ideal. Alternatively, perhaps “BOOKE” but K is out.

Realizing our earlier assumption might be flawed: maybe the word has only one O but the feedback was misinterpreted. Re-examining:

Guess 3: BOOZE → B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)  
- First O at position 2: (-) means O is in word but not position 2  
- Second O at position 3: (✓) means O is correctly there  
Thus the word has exactly one O at position 3, and no other O’s. The (-) for position 2 O simply means the letter O is not at position 2, but is at position 3 (already confirmed). So no second O exists.

Thus the pattern is strictly: B _ O _ E with no second O, and we need a valid letter for position 2 and 4 from remaining pool: D, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,biome,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly gather information about which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended for this purpose as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good initial feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (✓) – in the word and in the right spot (position 3)
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – in the word and in the right spot (position 5)

So the secret word has:
- _ _ O _ E
- Cannot contain A, R, S
- Contains O in position 3 and E in position 5

Next, I should pick a word that keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5, and introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Good letters to try next: T, N, L, D, I, U, M, etc.

A word that fits this pattern and introduces several new letters is “CHOKE.”
- C(edges out) – new
- H – new
- O – in position 3 (✓)
- K – new
- E – in position 5 (✓)

Let’s try CHOKE.

<guess>CHOKE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CHOKE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E  (positions 3 and 5 are fixed as O and E)
- Already-eliminated letters: A, R, S, C, H, K
- We need two new consonants or vowels to fill positions 1 and 4
- Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Good next candidates should use fresh letters, especially ones that appear frequently in 5-letter words. A high-value set is {D, I, N, T}. I’ll choose the word “PHONE”:
- P – new
- H – already ruled out (from CHOKE), so this is bad.  
Let me pick something else.

Next candidate: “DOWNE”
- D – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- N – new
- E – locked  
But this uses W, which is less common. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P – new
- O – locked
- I – new
- N – new
- T – new  
And it keeps O in position 3 while we still need position 5 to be E, so T can’t go there. 

A better choice respecting the pattern _ _ O _ E:
“DONKE” – but K is out.
“MOUSE” – S is out.
“TONNE” – N repeated, T new.
“VOICE” – C is out.
“BOONE” – B new, O locked, O repeated, N new, E locked. Two O’s are allowed if it’s the secret word (e.g., “BOOZE”), but we don’t know. Let’s go with “BOONE.”

But “BOONE” has two O’s, and we only know one O is confirmed in position 3. Let’s try “MONEY.”
- M – new
- O – locked
- N – new
- E – locked, must be in position 5
- Y – new
Pattern: M O N E Y → but that would put E in position 4, which violates the known position.  

Revise: positions 3 and 5 must be O and E respectively, so we need _ _ O _ E. A good word is “BLOKE” (but K is out). How about “TOWER”?
- T – new
- O – locked
- W – new
- E – locked must be in 5, but here it’s in 4 – not matching.  

Correct pattern: _ _ O _ E. Let me choose “DONNE” (but N repeated). “FOGLE” – G and L new. Wait, “FOGLE” ends with E in 5, has O in 3, and F/G/L are new.  

I’ll go with “FOGLE.”
But “FOGLE” doesn’t fit pattern _ _ O _ E. Let me list a few valid words that match _ _ O _ E and use only allowed letters:

- DOWNE – W not great
- GONNE – G new, N new, G/N allowed
- TONNE – T new, N new
- VOGUE – V new, G new, U new
- LOOSE – S is out
- POOLE – P new, L new
- MOOSE – S out
- GOOSE – S out
- HOOVE – H out
- BOOZE – Z new, B new
- NOOSE – S out
- WOOKE – K out

Best remaining with fresh letters: “BOOZE” (B, Z new). Let’s try “BOOZE.”

<guess>BOOZE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CHOKE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: BOOZE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ _ _ O _ E  (positions 3 and 5 fixed)

2. CHOKE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)
   ⇒ confirms positions 3 & 5, eliminates C, H, K

3. BOOZE → B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)
   - B(✓) means B is correct at position 1: B _ O _ E
   - O(-) for the second O means that second O is in the word but in the wrong position; however position 3 already has O, so the word must contain an additional O somewhere else.
   - Z(x) ⇒ no Z
   - Letters we know so far: B, O, E
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, S, C, H, K, Z

Thus the pattern must be:
B _ O _ E  (with a second O somewhere in positions 2 or 4)

Possible second-O placements:
- B O O _ E  → positions 2 and 3
- B _ O O E  → positions 3 and 4

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words that fit either:
- B O O _ E  → “BOOKE” (invalid, K out), “BOOGE” (invalid), “BOOLE” (name), “BOONE” (name, N allowed)
- B _ O O E  → “BROOE” (no), “BLOOE” (no), “BHOOE” (no) – none seem valid.

Only plausible dictionary word is “BOONE” (though it’s a proper noun it’s accepted in Wordle lists). But we already used BOOZE, so let’s check:

Letters to test: D, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Looking for B _ O _ E with an extra O:
B O O N E – “BOONE”
B O O S E – S out
B O O T E – “BOOTE” uncommon
B O O P E – invalid
B L O O E – invalid
B N O O E – invalid

“BOONE” is the only candidate, but we need to make sure N and the second O are fresh. N is fresh (never used). So “BOONE” fits perfectly with the pattern and feedback.

Let’s lock it in.

B O O _ E  (positions 2 and 3 both O)\n2. B _ O O E  (positions 3 and 4 both O)\n\nLet’s look for valid 5-letter English words meeting either pattern, using only allowed letters (not A, R, S, C, H, K, Z, N).\n\nPattern 1: B O O _ E  \nPossible endings: F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  \nChecking: BOOGE (no), BOOLE (name), BOOME (no), BOOPE (no), BOOTE (uncommon), BOOVE (no) – nothing standard.\n\nPattern 2: B _ O O E  \nPossible second letters: D, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  \nValid words: B L O O E (no), B D O O E (no), B F O O E (no), B G O O E (no), B I O O E (no), B M O O E (no), B P O O E (no), B T O O E (no), B U O O E (no), B V O O E (no), B W O O E (no), B Y O O E (no) – none valid.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine: is there any standard word fitting B _ O _ E with an extra O elsewhere? The only standard word that fits B _ O _ E and contains a second O is actually “BOOGE” (slang), but G is allowed. However, English 5-letter word “BOOGE” is not standard.\n\nRealizing: the word must be “BOOZE” but Z is out. So let me reconsider: maybe the extra O is in position 2, giving B O O _ E. The only common word fitting is “BOOGE” but let’s try “BOOGE”.\n\nBut we need a fresh guess. The only remaining possible word seems “BOOGE” or perhaps we missed something. Actually, checking word lists, a valid word is “BOOGE” but another possibility is “BOOPE” (no). Realizing we might have missed “BOOUE” or similar, but none standard.\n\nWait – let me step back: the word must be B _ O _ E with an extra O. The only remaining possibility is the word “BOOGE” but this is not ideal. Alternatively, perhaps “BOOKE” but K is out.\n\nRealizing our earlier assumption might be flawed: maybe the word has only one O but the feedback was misinterpreted. Re-examining:\n\nGuess 3: BOOZE → B(✓) O(-) O(✓) Z(x) E(✓)  \n- First O at position 2: (-) means O is in word but not position 2  \n- Second O at position 3: (✓) means O is correctly there  \nThus the word has exactly one O at position 3, and no other O’s. The (-) for position 2 O simply means the letter O is not at position 2, but is at position 3 (already confirmed). So no second O exists.\n\nThus the pattern is strictly: B _ O _ E with no second O, and we need a valid letter for position 2 and 4 from remaining pool: D, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nLooking for valid words:\nB D O G E → B DOGE (valid)\nB L O W E → BLOWE (no)\nB L O V E → BLOVE (no)\nB L O D E → BLODE (no)\nB L O P E → BLOPE (no)\nB L O T E → BLOTE (no)\nB F O G E → BFOGE (no)\nB P O K E → P invalid (K out)\nB P O L E → BPOLE (no)\nB T O M E → BTOME (no)\nB T O W E → BTOWE (no)\nB V O W E → BVOWE (no)\nB D O M E → B DOME (valid)\nB D O P E → B DOPE (valid)\nB G O L E → BGOLE (no)\nB G O D E → BGODE (no)\nB G O V E → BGOVE (no)\nB M O L E → B MOLE (valid)\nB M O P E → B MOPE (valid)\nB P O L E → B POLE (valid)\nB L O G E → BLOGE (no)\nB L O S E → S out\nB F O L E → BFOLE (no)\nB F O D E → BFODE (no)\nB F O G E → BFOGE (no)\nB F O M E → BFOME (no)\nB F O P E → BFOPE (no)\nB F O T E → BFOTE (no)\nB F O V E → BFOVE (no)\nB F O W E → BFOWE (no)\n\nValid candidates: B DOME, B DOPE, B MOLE, B MOPE, B POLE\n\nBest to pick one with new common letters to maximize info.
