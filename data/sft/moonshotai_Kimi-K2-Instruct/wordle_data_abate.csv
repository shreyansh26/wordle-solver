For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good starting word typically includes letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc.

After considering options like ""ARISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,abate,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. A good starting word typically includes letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc.

After considering options like ""ARISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers most common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- E(✓) → E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word (they all got an x).

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ E, and the remaining letters cannot include R, O, or S.

Next, I should guess a word that:
- Keeps A in position 1 and E in position 5.
- Avoids R, O, S.
- Uses common letters to test new positions.

Good candidate letters for the middle positions: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, I, U, etc.  
Let me pick a word that introduces several of these: A N G L E.  
- Uses N, G, L (none are R, O, S).  
- Keeps A and E in place.  

If any letters in ANGLE get ✓ or -, I’ll know if they’re in the word or not.

Remaining common consonants to test: T, D, B, C, M, P, H, etc.
Remaining vowels to test for positions 2-4: I, U (since A & E are already fixed)

A good tactic is to test two new consonants plus two new vowels in one guess, while keeping the A-E frame.

Candidate letters to test: T, I, D, U, B, C, M, P, H…

A clean 5-letter word that fits:
- A _ _ _ E
- Uses only fresh letters
- Common letters: A B I D E

Let’s try ABIDE:
A ✓ B ? I ? D ? E ✓
Letters tested: B, I, D  
These haven’t been used yet and are common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- Word shape: A B _ _ E
- Eliminated middle letters: I, D, N, G, L, R, O, S
- Remaining common consonants to test for positions 3 & 4: T, C, M, P, H, Y, K, etc.
- Remaining vowels to test: U (only one left that hasn’t been tried)

A natural next step is to test the letter U (the only unused common vowel) plus two fresh consonants in the third and fourth positions.  
Candidate consonants: T, C, M, P—none have been ruled out.

Among the possible combinations, ABUTE is a valid 5-letter word that satisfies:
- Keeps A (1) B (2) E (5) fixed.
- Introduces U in position 3 to test placement.
- Introduces T in position 4, a very common letter.

Thus, ABUTE gives maximal information.

Current confirmed positions:
- Position 1: A

Remaining common letters to test for position 3: C, M, P, H, Y, K, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching A B _ T E:
- ABATE (but A is already used in position 1)
- ABBOT (but O is eliminated)
- ABDET (invalid)
- ABET (too short)
- ABLATE (too long)
- ABRIDGE (too long)
- ABSTER (invalid)
- ABYSS (invalid)
- ABLET (invalid)
- ABMOT (invalid)

Looking at valid words: The only common word fitting is ABATE (but A is already confirmed in position 1, and this would duplicate A). However, we need to check if there's any other valid word.

Actually, checking dictionary: ABYTE is invalid, ABITE is invalid, ABOTE is invalid (O is eliminated), ABCTE is invalid.

The most likely candidate is actually ABATE, even though it repeats the A. But since we know position 1 is A and position 5 is E, and position 4 is T, position 2 is B, the only letter left is position 3.

Looking at remaining unused common letters: C, M, P, H, Y, K...

The valid word that fits is:
- A B A T E → ABATE

But we already have A confirmed in position 1 and E in position 5. The feedback says A(✓) in position 1 is correct, but doesn't preclude A from appearing again. However, ABATE has A in position 3 which hasn't been tested yet.

But looking at the pattern: A B _ T E, and we haven't tried A in position 3.

So the logical next guess is ABATE to test if A appears again in position 3.
