For my first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that contains common letters used in English words to maximize the information I get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first word should ideally contain several of these common letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible. Popular starting choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear frequently in English words. This should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word contains the letters A and E, but not R, O, or S. A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

To maximize new information, I want a word that uses common letters that weren’t in AROSE. The unused common letters include T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc. Since A and E are known to be present, I’ll try to place A and E in new spots while introducing fresh letters.

Candidate structure:
- A should be in positions 2-5.
- E should be in positions 1-4.

Let’s avoid R, O, S.

A good next word could be ""LATED"":
- Uses new letters L, T, D.
- Places E in position 4 (new spot).
- Places A in position 2 (new spot).
- Keeps the word valid and common.

We now know:

Letters that are in the word: A (fixed in position 2), E (fixed in position 4).  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, D.  
Letter T is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ E _

Positions still unknown: 1, 3, 5.

Available letters to try (excluding R,O,S,L,D,T) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know T must appear somewhere, and it can go in positions 1, 2 (but A is already there), 4 (E is already there), or 5.

Let’s construct a word that:
- keeps A in position 2 and E in position 4,
- places T in one of the remaining valid positions (1 or 5),
- uses two new consonants in the remaining open spots.

One simple candidate is “CATER”:
- C in position 1, A in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.
But R is already known NOT to be in the word, so skip.

Try “T” in position 1 and pick two new consonants for positions 3 and 5 that haven’t been ruled out:
- T in 1, A in 2, _ in 3, E in 4, _ in 5.

Good consonants to test: C, N, H, M, P, G, B, etc.

A word that fits: “TANCE” – but “tance” is not a valid English word.

Try “TABLE” – but D is already ruled out (no, D is ruled out, but B is okay). However E is in position 4, so TABLE has E in 4 – that’s fine, but we already know B hasn’t been tested.

Wait – TABLE:
T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), B in 3, L ruled out, E in 4 (correct). But L is ruled out, so that’s out.

Let’s instead use T in position 5.

Then pattern becomes: _ A _ E T.

Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 3.

Valid words: “PANEL” – L ruled out.  
“CABER” – R ruled out.  
“HAVEN” – N not ruled out yet, but V and H are new.  
“CAVET” – not a word.  
“MANTE” – not a word.  
“GAMET” – not a word.  
“PANET” – not a word.  
“PAVET” – not a word.  
“CAMET” – not a word.  
“BANET” – not a word.

Actually, “CAVET” isn’t valid. Let’s try “C” in 1 and “N” in 3: C A N E T → “CANET” – not valid.  
“W” in 1: W A _ E T → “WAXET” – no.  
“H” in 1: H A _ E T → “HAVET” – not valid.  
“G” in 1: G A _ E T → “GAVET” – no.  
“M” in 1: M A _ E T → “MAVEN” – N at end, but E is in 4, so M A V E N – that’s valid.

MAVEN:
M (new), A (correct spot), V (new), E (correct spot), N (new).
This uses only letters not yet ruled out and tests V and N while keeping A and E fixed.

So I’ll guess “MAVEN”.

Good consonants to test: C, N, H, M, P, G, B, etc.

A word that fits: “TANCE” – but “tance” is not a valid English word.

Try “TABLE” – but D is already ruled out (no, D is ruled out, but B is okay). However E is in position 4, so TABLE has E in 4 – that’s fine, but we already know B hasn’t been tested.

Wait – TABLE:
T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), B in 3, L ruled out, E in 4 (correct). But L is ruled out, so that’s out.

Let’s instead use T in position 5.

Then pattern becomes: _ A _ E T.

Need two new consonants for positions 1 and 3.

Valid words: “PANEL” – L ruled out.  
“CABER” – R ruled out.  
“HAVEN” – N not ruled out yet, but V and H are new.  
“CAVET” – not a word.  
“MANTE” – not a word.  
“GAMET” – not a word.  
“PANET” – not a word.  
“PAVET” – not a word.  
“CAMET” – not a word.  
“BANET” – not a word.

Actually, “CAVET” isn’t valid. Let’s try “C” in 1 and “N” in 3: C A N E T → “CANET” – not valid.  
“W” in 1: W A _ E T → “WAXET” – no.  
“H” in 1: H A _ E T → “HAVET” – not valid.  
“G” in 1: G A _ E T → “GAVET” – no.  
“M” in 1: M A _ E T → “MAVEN” – N at end, but E is in 4, so M A V E N – that’s valid.

MAVEN:
M (new), A (correct spot), V (new), E (correct spot), N (new).
This uses only letters not yet ruled out and tests V and N while keeping A and E fixed.

So I’ll guess “MAVEN”.

We now know the word looks like:

_ A _ E N   (positions 2 = A, 4 = E, 5 = N)

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, D, M, V  
Letters we still need to place: T (must appear somewhere) plus two additional letters from the remaining unused consonants (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.).

T is confirmed present but cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
So T must go in position 1 or 3.  
Position 3 is open: _ A _ E N.  
But position 3 can’t be T (because T is in the word but not in position 3). Therefore T must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:

T A _ E N

Only position 3 is unknown.  
Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting T A _ E N.

Possible letters for position 3: consonants that make a real word.

Check common options:
- T A B E N → “taben” – not valid.
- T A C E N → “tacen” – not valid.
- T A G E N → “tagen” – not valid.
- T A P E N → “tapen” – not valid.
- T A H E N → “tahen” – not valid.
- T A K E N → “taken” – VALID word.

So the only common word fitting the pattern is “TAKEN”.
