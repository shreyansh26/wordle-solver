For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and frequently used consonants.

Looking at common English letters, the top ones are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starter word should cover multiple of these.

Possible good starter words: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
1. Contains S (very common starting letter)
2. Contains L, T (common consonants)
3. Contains A, E (the two most common vowels)
4. Covers 5 distinct letters

From the feedback on SLATE:

1. S ✗  – not in the word at all  
2. L ✗  – not in the word at all  
3. A ✗  – not in the word at all  
4. T –  – T is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4)  
5. E –  – E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5)

So we know:
- No S, L, A
- T and E are both present, but not in their original places (positions 4 and 5)

The remaining letters (from alphabet, ignoring S, L, A) plus known T, E must be arranged in positions where T and E are not in 4th or 5th slots respectively.

A common next move is to test a word with fresh letters to gather more information. Good consonants yet to test: R, N, C, H, D, M, etc. Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Choosing ""TREND"":
- Uses T (known to be in word) but shifts it to position 1 instead of 4.
- Uses E (known to be in word) but shifts it to position 3 instead of 5.
- Introduces R, N, D – which are common consonants not yet tested.
- No S, L, A.

This gives us coverage of 5 new letters (if we treat T and E as already known) and good spread.

Current information:
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 (from TREND)

- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, R, N, D
- Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
- Vowels still possible: E, I, O, U (since A is out)

We have T _ _ _ _ and need to place E in position 2 or 5.  
Let’s try E in position 2 (TE _ _ _), which gives a strong “TE” start, then test fresh consonants.

- Valid 5-letter words starting with TE: TECUM (not common), TEMPO, TEPID, TERRY (R ruled out), TESLA (S, L ruled out), etc.

- Uses E in position 2 (new position for E)
- Introduces P, I, D (but D was already ruled out in TREND) – oops!

“TEPID” uses D which is already ruled out.
