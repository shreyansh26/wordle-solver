For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will give me good information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses because they cover many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

Let’s parse the new feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Guess 2: MUTES → M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)

What we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1), but in Guess 2 S was marked (-) in position 5 … which is impossible if it’s actually in the correct position.  
   This contradiction means the feedback must be interpreted strictly position-by-position:

   - Guess 2 feedback for position 5: S(-) simply tells us that in position 5 the letter S is marked as “in the word but wrong position.”  
   - But we already know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. The only way both clues are consistent is if the Guess 2 feedback is read strictly:  
     – Position 1: M(x) → no M  
     – Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
     – Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
     – Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
     – Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … yet we know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. This is impossible.

   The only logical resolution is that the feedback for Guess 2 should be read as:

   Position 1: M(x) → no M  
   Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
   Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
   Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
   Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … which contradicts Guess 1.

   Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted the same way as Wordle: the (-) only tells us “elsewhere in the word,” not necessarily “not in this position.”  
   So after two guesses we have:

   Letters we know:
   - S is in position 5 (from Guess 1)  
   - U is in position 2 (from Guess 2)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 1)  
   - T is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M  
   - No info yet about positions 1 and 3 except that they are not the letters above.

   Word pattern so far: _ U _ _ S  
   The word must contain E and T somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is S, position 2 is U).

   Possible placements:
   - E could be 1 or 3  
   - T could be 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)

   Let’s list candidates:

   1. E U T _ S → needs consonant in 4, common letters left: D, N, L, C, etc.
      – E U T N S → “EUTNS” (not a word)  
      – E U T L S (invalid)  
   2. T U E _ S → only position 4 left, needs consonant:  
      – T U E D S (invalid)  
      – T U E N S (invalid)  
   3. _ U E T S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U E T S (invalid)  
      – C U E T S (invalid)  
      – D U E T S (invalid)  
      – L U E T S (invalid)  
      – N U E T S (invalid)  
      – P U E T S (invalid)  
   4. _ U T E S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U T E S (invalid)  
      – C U T E S (invalid)  
      – D U T E S (invalid)  
      – L U T E S (invalid)  
      – N U T E S (invalid)  
      – P U T E S (invalid)  
   5. T U _ E S → position 3: must be a consonant not forbidden and not T or S (already used)  
      – T U B E S (invalid)  
      – T U C E S (invalid)  
      – T U D E S (invalid)  
      – T U G E S (invalid)  
      – T U N E S (valid word: TUNES)  
      – T U P E S (invalid)

   Only one valid common word emerges: T U N E S.
</think>

We know:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓)
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 4
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M
- No repeats

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Guess 2: MUTES → M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)

What we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1), but in Guess 2 S was marked (-) in position 5 … which is impossible if it’s actually in the correct position.  
   This contradiction means the feedback must be interpreted strictly position-by-position:

     – Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
     – Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
     – Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … yet we know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. This is impossible.

   The only logical resolution is that the feedback for Guess 2 should be read as:

   Position 1: M(x) → no M  
   Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
   Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
   Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
   Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … which contradicts Guess 1.

   Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted the same way as Wordle: the (-) only tells us “elsewhere in the word,” not necessarily “not in this position.”  
   So after two guesses we have:

   Letters we know:
   - S is in position 5 (from Guess 1)

   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 1)

   - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M  
   - No info yet about positions 1 and 3 except that they are not the letters above.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will give me good information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses because they cover many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x): A is not in the secret word
- R(x): R is not in the secret word
- O(x): O is not in the secret word
- S(✓): S is in the correct position (5th letter)
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4)

So we know:
- The word ends with S
- It contains E but E is not in position 4
- None of A, R, O are in the word

I need a word that:
1. Ends with S
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. Does not contain A, R, O

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B
Good vowel to use: E (must be there), plus maybe I or U

Since position 5 is S, and E must appear earlier, I'll try a word with E in position 2. Let me think of words like ""TENTS"" but T is repeated, or ""LENDS"" but R is out, so maybe ""LENDS"" without R... wait R is out. Let me try ""MUTES"" - it has:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- No A, R, O
- Uses common letters M, U, T

This should test M, U, T, E in new positions while confirming S is fixed at the end.

<guess>MUTES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: MUTES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s parse the new feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Guess 2: MUTES → M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)

What we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1), but in Guess 2 S was marked (-) in position 5 … which is impossible if it’s actually in the correct position.  
   This contradiction means the feedback must be interpreted strictly position-by-position:

   - Guess 2 feedback for position 5: S(-) simply tells us that in position 5 the letter S is marked as “in the word but wrong position.”  
   - But we already know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. The only way both clues are consistent is if the Guess 2 feedback is read strictly:  
     – Position 1: M(x) → no M  
     – Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
     – Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
     – Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
     – Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … yet we know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. This is impossible.

   The only logical resolution is that the feedback for Guess 2 should be read as:

   Position 1: M(x) → no M  
   Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
   Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
   Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
   Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … which contradicts Guess 1.

   Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted the same way as Wordle: the (-) only tells us “elsewhere in the word,” not necessarily “not in this position.”  
   So after two guesses we have:

   Letters we know:
   - S is in position 5 (from Guess 1)  
   - U is in position 2 (from Guess 2)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 1)  
   - T is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M  
   - No info yet about positions 1 and 3 except that they are not the letters above.

   Word pattern so far: _ U _ _ S  
   The word must contain E and T somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is S, position 2 is U).

   Possible placements:
   - E could be 1 or 3  
   - T could be 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)

   Let’s list candidates:

   1. E U T _ S → needs consonant in 4, common letters left: D, N, L, C, etc.
      – E U T N S → “EUTNS” (not a word)  
      – E U T L S (invalid)  
   2. T U E _ S → only position 4 left, needs consonant:  
      – T U E D S (invalid)  
      – T U E N S (invalid)  
   3. _ U E T S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U E T S (invalid)  
      – C U E T S (invalid)  
      – D U E T S (invalid)  
      – L U E T S (invalid)  
      – N U E T S (invalid)  
      – P U E T S (invalid)  
   4. _ U T E S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U T E S (invalid)  
      – C U T E S (invalid)  
      – D U T E S (invalid)  
      – L U T E S (invalid)  
      – N U T E S (invalid)  
      – P U T E S (invalid)  
   5. T U _ E S → position 3: must be a consonant not forbidden and not T or S (already used)  
      – T U B E S (invalid)  
      – T U C E S (invalid)  
      – T U D E S (invalid)  
      – T U G E S (invalid)  
      – T U N E S (valid word: TUNES)  
      – T U P E S (invalid)

   Only one valid common word emerges: T U N E S.We know:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓)
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 4
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M
- No repeats

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ U _ _ S with U in position 2, S in position 5, plus both E and T is T U N E S.

Let’s tabulate what each position and letter tells us.

1. Positions we know:
   - Position 2: U is fixed (✓).
   - Position 5: S is fixed (✓).

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but not yet placed):
   - E (from Guess 1) – not in position 4.
   - T (from Guess 2) – not in position 3.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - A, R, O, M, N (from Guesses 1–3).

4. Word pattern so far:
   _ U _ _ S

5. Remaining unused, common letters:
   Vowels: I
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but sticking to common ones).

6. Where can E and T go?
   - E must occupy position 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 and 5 is S).
   - T must occupy position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

7. Let’s enumerate possibilities:

   Case A: T goes in position 1 → T U _ _ S  
   – Need E in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is open for E.  
     – T U B E S → uses B (valid 5-letter word).  
     – T U C E S → uses C (valid).  
     – T U D E S → uses D (valid).  
     – T U F E S → uses F (valid).  
     – T U G E S → uses G (valid).  
     – T U K E S → uses K (valid).  
     – T U L E S → uses L (valid).  
     – T U P E S → uses P (valid).  
   All these fit and haven’t been ruled out.

   Case B: T goes in position 4 → _ U _ T S  
   – E must then go in position 1 or 3.  
     – B U E T S (invalid word).

     – V U E T S (invalid).  
     – W U E T S (invalid).

Therefore, the only plausible candidates are those in Case A: T U _ E S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses because they cover many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

- O(x): O is not in the secret word
- S(✓): S is in the correct position (5th letter)
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4)

So we know:
- The word ends with S
- It contains E but E is not in position 4
- None of A, R, O are in the word

I need a word that:
1. Ends with S
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. Does not contain A, R, O

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B
Good vowel to use: E (must be there), plus maybe I or U

Since position 5 is S, and E must appear earlier, I'll try a word with E in position 2. Let me think of words like ""TENTS"" but T is repeated, or ""LENDS"" but R is out, so maybe ""LENDS"" without R... wait R is out. Let me try ""MUTES"" - it has:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- No A, R, O
- Uses common letters M, U, T

This should test M, U, T, E in new positions while confirming S is fixed at the end.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: MUTES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s parse the new feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Guess 2: MUTES → M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)

What we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1), but in Guess 2 S was marked (-) in position 5 … which is impossible if it’s actually in the correct position.  
   This contradiction means the feedback must be interpreted strictly position-by-position:

   - Guess 2 feedback for position 5: S(-) simply tells us that in position 5 the letter S is marked as “in the word but wrong position.”  
   - But we already know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. The only way both clues are consistent is if the Guess 2 feedback is read strictly:  
     – Position 1: M(x) → no M  
     – Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
     – Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
     – Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
     – Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … yet we know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. This is impossible.

   The only logical resolution is that the feedback for Guess 2 should be read as:

   Position 1: M(x) → no M  
   Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
   Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
   Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
   Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … which contradicts Guess 1.

   Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted the same way as Wordle: the (-) only tells us “elsewhere in the word,” not necessarily “not in this position.”  
   So after two guesses we have:

   Letters we know:
   - S is in position 5 (from Guess 1)  
   - U is in position 2 (from Guess 2)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 1)  
   - T is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M  
   - No info yet about positions 1 and 3 except that they are not the letters above.

   Word pattern so far: _ U _ _ S  
   The word must contain E and T somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is S, position 2 is U).

   Possible placements:
   - E could be 1 or 3  
   - T could be 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)

   Let’s list candidates:

   1. E U T _ S → needs consonant in 4, common letters left: D, N, L, C, etc.
      – E U T N S → “EUTNS” (not a word)  
      – E U T L S (invalid)  
   2. T U E _ S → only position 4 left, needs consonant:  
      – T U E D S (invalid)  
      – T U E N S (invalid)  
   3. _ U E T S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U E T S (invalid)  
      – C U E T S (invalid)  
      – D U E T S (invalid)  
      – L U E T S (invalid)  
      – N U E T S (invalid)  
      – P U E T S (invalid)  
   4. _ U T E S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U T E S (invalid)  
      – C U T E S (invalid)  
      – D U T E S (invalid)  
      – L U T E S (invalid)  
      – N U T E S (invalid)  
      – P U T E S (invalid)  
   5. T U _ E S → position 3: must be a consonant not forbidden and not T or S (already used)  
      – T U B E S (invalid)  
      – T U C E S (invalid)  
      – T U D E S (invalid)  
      – T U G E S (invalid)  
      – T U N E S (valid word: TUNES)  
      – T U P E S (invalid)

   Only one valid common word emerges: T U N E S.We know:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓)
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 4
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M
- No repeats

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ U _ _ S with U in position 2, S in position 5, plus both E and T is T U N E S.

Guess 3: TUNES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) N(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate what each position and letter tells us.

1. Positions we know:
   - Position 2: U is fixed (✓).
   - Position 5: S is fixed (✓).

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but not yet placed):
   - E (from Guess 1) – not in position 4.
   - T (from Guess 2) – not in position 3.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - A, R, O, M, N (from Guesses 1–3).

4. Word pattern so far:
   _ U _ _ S

5. Remaining unused, common letters:
   Vowels: I
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but sticking to common ones).

6. Where can E and T go?
   - E must occupy position 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 and 5 is S).
   - T must occupy position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

7. Let’s enumerate possibilities:

   Case A: T goes in position 1 → T U _ _ S  
   – Need E in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is open for E.  
     – T U B E S → uses B (valid 5-letter word).  
     – T U C E S → uses C (valid).  
     – T U D E S → uses D (valid).  
     – T U F E S → uses F (valid).  
     – T U G E S → uses G (valid).  
     – T U K E S → uses K (valid).  
     – T U L E S → uses L (valid).  
     – T U P E S → uses P (valid).  
   All these fit and haven’t been ruled out.

   Case B: T goes in position 4 → _ U _ T S  
   – E must then go in position 1 or 3.  
     – B U E T S (invalid word).  
     – C U E T S (invalid).  
     – D U E T S (invalid).  
     – F U E T S (invalid).  
     – G U E T S (invalid).  
     – H U E T S (invalid).  
     – K U E T S (invalid).  
     – L U E T S (invalid).  
     – P U E T S (invalid).  
     – V U E T S (invalid).  
     – W U E T S (invalid).  
     – Y U E T S (invalid).  
   None of these are real words.

Therefore, the only plausible candidates are those in Case A: T U _ E S.

Among them, “TUBES” is a common, high-frequency word that tests two additional new consonants (T, B) and keeps E in the only spot still possible (position 4). It satisfies all constraints:
- T in 1, U in 2, E in 4, S in 5.
- Doesn’t reuse any forbidden or already-eliminated letters.

- T (cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5, so must be in 4)

Letters ruled out (x): A, R, O, M, N, B

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Since T must now be in position 4 (the only slot left), the template becomes:
_  U  _  T  S

E must fit in either position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- E U _ T S → invalid (no standard word)
- _ U E T S → invalid (no standard word)
- But we also have to place E somewhere inside. The only remaining place for E is position 3, because position 1 is a consonant and position 4 is T.

So the word must be:  Consonant  U  E  T  S.

Common 5-letter words that fit C U E T S, D U E T S, etc. do not exist.  
However, there is one well-known word:  D U E T S → plural of duet, which is valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B
Good vowel to use: E (must be there), plus maybe I or U

Since position 5 is S, and E must appear earlier, I'll try a word with E in position 2. Let me think of words like ""TENTS"" but T is repeated, or ""LENDS"" but R is out, so maybe ""LENDS"" without R... wait R is out. Let me try ""MUTES"" - it has:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- No A, R, O
- Uses common letters M, U, T

This should test M, U, T, E in new positions while confirming S is fixed at the end.

<guess>MUTES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: MUTES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s parse the new feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Guess 2: MUTES → M(x) U(✓) T(-) E(-) S(-)

What we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1), but in Guess 2 S was marked (-) in position 5 … which is impossible if it’s actually in the correct position.  
   This contradiction means the feedback must be interpreted strictly position-by-position:

   - Guess 2 feedback for position 5: S(-) simply tells us that in position 5 the letter S is marked as “in the word but wrong position.”  
   - But we already know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. The only way both clues are consistent is if the Guess 2 feedback is read strictly:  
     – Position 1: M(x) → no M  
     – Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
     – Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
     – Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
     – Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … yet we know from Guess 1 that S is in position 5. This is impossible.

   The only logical resolution is that the feedback for Guess 2 should be read as:

   Position 1: M(x) → no M  
   Position 2: U(✓) → U is correct in position 2  
   Position 3: T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 3  
   Position 4: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4  
   Position 5: S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 … which contradicts Guess 1.

   Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted the same way as Wordle: the (-) only tells us “elsewhere in the word,” not necessarily “not in this position.”  
   So after two guesses we have:

   Letters we know:
   - S is in position 5 (from Guess 1)  
   - U is in position 2 (from Guess 2)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 1)  
   - T is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2)  
   - Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M  
   - No info yet about positions 1 and 3 except that they are not the letters above.

   Word pattern so far: _ U _ _ S  
   The word must contain E and T somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is S, position 2 is U).

   Possible placements:
   - E could be 1 or 3  
   - T could be 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)

   Let’s list candidates:

   1. E U T _ S → needs consonant in 4, common letters left: D, N, L, C, etc.
      – E U T N S → “EUTNS” (not a word)  
      – E U T L S (invalid)  
   2. T U E _ S → only position 4 left, needs consonant:  
      – T U E D S (invalid)  
      – T U E N S (invalid)  
   3. _ U E T S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U E T S (invalid)  
      – C U E T S (invalid)  
      – D U E T S (invalid)  
      – L U E T S (invalid)  
      – N U E T S (invalid)  
      – P U E T S (invalid)  
   4. _ U T E S → position 1: any consonant not forbidden, not already used  
      – B U T E S (invalid)  
      – C U T E S (invalid)  
      – D U T E S (invalid)  
      – L U T E S (invalid)  
      – N U T E S (invalid)  
      – P U T E S (invalid)  
   5. T U _ E S → position 3: must be a consonant not forbidden and not T or S (already used)  
      – T U B E S (invalid)  
      – T U C E S (invalid)  
      – T U D E S (invalid)  
      – T U G E S (invalid)  
      – T U N E S (valid word: TUNES)  
      – T U P E S (invalid)

   Only one valid common word emerges: T U N E S.We know:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓)
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 4
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, M
- No repeats

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ U _ _ S with U in position 2, S in position 5, plus both E and T is T U N E S.

1. Positions we know:
   - Position 2: U is fixed (✓).
   - Position 5: S is fixed (✓).

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but not yet placed):
   - E (from Guess 1) – not in position 4.
   - T (from Guess 2) – not in position 3.

3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - A, R, O, M, N (from Guesses 1–3).

4. Word pattern so far:
   _ U _ _ S

5. Remaining unused, common letters:
   Vowels: I
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but sticking to common ones).

6. Where can E and T go?
   - E must occupy position 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 and 5 is S).
   - T must occupy position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

7. Let’s enumerate possibilities:

   Case A: T goes in position 1 → T U _ _ S  
   – Need E in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is open for E.  
     – T U B E S → uses B (valid 5-letter word).  
     – T U C E S → uses C (valid).  
     – T U D E S → uses D (valid).  
     – T U F E S → uses F (valid).  
     – T U G E S → uses G (valid).  
     – T U K E S → uses K (valid).  
     – T U L E S → uses L (valid).  
     – T U P E S → uses P (valid).  
   All these fit and haven’t been ruled out.

   Case B: T goes in position 4 → _ U _ T S  
   – E must then go in position 1 or 3.  
     – B U E T S (invalid word).  
     – C U E T S (invalid).  
     – D U E T S (invalid).  
     – F U E T S (invalid).  
     – G U E T S (invalid).  
     – H U E T S (invalid).  
     – K U E T S (invalid).  
     – L U E T S (invalid).  
     – P U E T S (invalid).  
     – V U E T S (invalid).  
     – W U E T S (invalid).  
     – Y U E T S (invalid).  
   None of these are real words.

Therefore, the only plausible candidates are those in Case A: T U _ E S.

Among them, “TUBES” is a common, high-frequency word that tests two additional new consonants (T, B) and keeps E in the only spot still possible (position 4). It satisfies all constraints:
- T in 1, U in 2, E in 4, S in 5.
- Doesn’t reuse any forbidden or already-eliminated letters.

Fixed positions:
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Word template:  _  U  _  _  S

Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed:
- E (cannot be in position 4, so must be in 1 or 3)
- T (cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5, so must be in 4)

Letters ruled out (x): A, R, O, M, N, B

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Since T must now be in position 4 (the only slot left), the template becomes:
_  U  _  T  S

E must fit in either position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- E U _ T S → invalid (no standard word)
- _ U E T S → invalid (no standard word)
- But we also have to place E somewhere inside. The only remaining place for E is position 3, because position 1 is a consonant and position 4 is T.

So the word must be:  Consonant  U  E  T  S.

Common 5-letter words that fit C U E T S, D U E T S, etc. do not exist.  
However, there is one well-known word:  D U E T S → plural of duet, which is valid.

Other possibilities:
- G U E T S → invalid
- H U E T S → invalid
- P U E T S → invalid
- V U E T S → invalid
- W U E T S → invalid
- Y U E T S → invalid

The only valid word left fitting all constraints is D U E T S.

7. Checking valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
   - C U E T S → invalid
   - F U E T S → invalid
   - G U E T S → invalid
   - H U E T S → invalid
   - K U E T S → invalid
   - L U E T S → invalid
   - P U E T S → invalid
   - V U E T S → invalid
   - W U E T S → invalid
   - Y U E T S → invalid

However, there is one valid word: Q U E T S (plural of ""quet"", though rare). But ""quet"" is not common.

Wait, let me think again. The only common word that fits is actually G U E S T → but T is not in position 4 there. 

Actually, looking at the pattern strictly: _ U E T S. The only valid word is G U E S T reversed, which doesn't fit. 

But looking carefully, the correct pattern is:
1: ?
2: U
3: E
4: T
5: S

So the word is: [C] U E T S. The only valid word is G U E S T doesn't fit. 

Wait, let's list all 5-letter words ending in UETS. 

Checking the dictionary, the only valid word is:
G U E S T → but this would have T in position 5, but we know S is in position 5. 

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the feedback says:
- Position 1: D(x) → no D
- Position 2: U(✓) → fixed
- Position 3: E(✓) → fixed
- Position 4: T(-) → T is in word but not in position 4
- Position 5: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5

This contradicts our earlier assumption that S is in position 5. The feedback for DUETS shows S(-) in position 5, meaning S is in the word but NOT in position 5. This overturns our previous understanding.

Reconstructing:

1. S is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (from DUETS feedback)
2. U is in position 2 (✓ from MUTES and DUETS)
3. E is in position 3 (✓ from DUETS)
4. T is in the word but not in position 4 (from DUETS)
5. Positions ruled out letters:
   - 1: not A, R, O, M, D
   - 2: U is fixed
   - 3: E is fixed
   - 4: not T
   - 5: not S

6. Current pattern: _ U E _ _
   - Position 5 cannot be S, so S must be in position 1 or 4
   - T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2 is U, 3 is E)
     - So T must be in 1 or 5
   - Combining with S:
     - If S is in 1: S U E _ _ then T must be in 5: S U E _ T
     - If S is in 4: _ U E S _ then T must be in 1: T U E S _

7. Checking valid words:
   - S U E _ T → no common words
   - T U E S _ → only T U E S T (but that's 6 letters)
   - Actually, 5-letter words:
     - S U E E T (invalid)
     - S U E P T (invalid)
     - T U E S T is 5 letters? No, T U E S T is 5 letters but not a word
     - Looking again, the valid word is G U E S S (but S repeats)
     - Actually, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ U E _ _ with S and T is G U E S T, but S is in position 4 and T in 5: G U E S T.

8. Checking if G is allowed: G hasn't been ruled out yet (only A, R, O, M, N, B, D are out).

Thus, the only candidate is G U E S T.

But wait: in GUEST:
- Position 1: G (ok)
- Position 2: U (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 4: S (ok, since S is allowed in 4)
- Position 5: T (ok, since T is allowed in 5)
- Also, all ruled out letters are avoided.

Therefore, the correct guess is G U E S T.

<guess>GUEST</guess>",GUEST,"Summary of the clues so far:

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 2: U (✓)
   - Position 5: S (✓)

2. Word pattern: _ U _ _ S

3. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - E (now known to be in position 3, thanks to DUETS feedback: E(✓))
   - T (still somewhere in the word but not yet placed; must be in position 4 because positions 1, 3, 5 are taken or ruled out)

4. Letters ruled out (x): A, R, O, M, N, B, D

5. Remaining consonants to test for position 1: C, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

6. Since T must now be in position 4 (only remaining spot), and E is in position 3, the word must be:
   [Consonant] U E T S
