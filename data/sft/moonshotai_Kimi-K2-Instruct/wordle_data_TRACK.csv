For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequent vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to see which letters might be in the word.

From the new feedback on “train”:

- T is in the correct first position: T _ _ _ _
- R is confirmed again in position 2: T R _ _ _
- A is now in the correct third position: T R A _ _

So the pattern is T R A _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, N.

We still need two more letters. Common remaining consonants include L, G, C, D, M, B, etc. The only vowel we haven’t ruled out yet is U (since A is already placed). Let’s try adding L and M to test new letters and create a valid word.

A good candidate following this pattern is “traml”.
But that’s not a valid English word.

Next candidate: “trash” – but S has already been ruled out.

Next: “trawl” – uses W and L; W hasn’t been tested yet.

That seems viable: T R A W L.

Let’s check dictionary validity: “trawl” is indeed a valid 5-letter English word (a fishing net or verb).
