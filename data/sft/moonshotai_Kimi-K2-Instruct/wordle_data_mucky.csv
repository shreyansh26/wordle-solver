For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to gather maximum information. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I'll choose a word that includes several of these letters. ""ARISE"" is an excellent choice as it contains A, R, I, S, E - all very common letters, and it's a valid 5-letter word.

All five letters from ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) have been ruled out.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.

Let’s pick a new 5-letter word built from the remaining high-frequency letters, avoiding A, R, I, S, E.  
Top remaining consonants: N, T, L, D, C, M, P, H, K, B  
Top remaining vowel: O, U

A balanced combination:  
- O and U as vowels  
- N, T, L as consonants  

“UNTO” is only four letters, so we need one more consonant.  
“UNTOL” isn’t valid.  
Try “UNLIT” – but I is excluded.  
Try “UNLET” – E is excluded.  
Try “UNCOB” – B is low frequency.  

A better blend: O, U, N, T, L → “UNLOT” – not a valid word.  
Swap to “CLOUT” – contains C, L, O, U, T, all allowed.

“CLOUT” is valid and uses fresh high-frequency letters.

From the two guesses we know:

1. None of A, R, I, S, E, L, O, T appear in the final word at all (all received x).
2. Letters C and U are in the word but in the wrong positions in CLOUT:
   - C was in position 1 (wrong)
   - U was in position 4 (wrong)

Allowed letters so far: basically the rest of the alphabet excluding the eight already eliminated.  
Key high-frequency remaining letters: N, D, P, H, G, B, K, M, Y, F, W, V, plus C and U must appear.

We also know:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- U cannot be in position 4.

Let’s build a word that uses C and U plus other allowed letters and avoids the forbidden positions.

Good candidates: C _ _ _ _, _ C _ _ _, etc. and U not in slot 4.

Example: N, C, H, U, K → but “NCHUK” not valid.  
Try “CHUNK”: positions C(1) is invalid, U(4) is invalid. No good.  
Try “UNCUT”: U in slot 1 is new, but T is banned.  
Try “CUPID”: I and D are allowed, but I is banned.  
Try “CYMUL”: not valid.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x):  
A, R, I, S, E, L, O, T, N, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):  
M (✓, so it is in the correct position 1)  
U (-, so it is in the word but currently in wrong position 2)  
C (-, so it is in the word but currently in wrong position 5)

So we know:  
- 1st letter is M.  
- The remaining letters must contain both U and C somewhere, but not where they have already appeared:  
  – U cannot be in position 2 (from CLOUT and MUNCH) and also not in position 4 (from CLOUT).  
  – C cannot be in position 1 (from CLOUT) and cannot be in position 5 (from MUNCH).

Therefore possible positions:
U can be in 3 or 5.  
C can be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 3 could clash with U).

Available remaining letters (not yet eliminated):  
D, F, G, K, P, W, Y, B, V, etc. (basically any letter not on the x-list).

We need three more letters for positions 2, 3, 4 (or 2, 4, 5 etc. depending on where we place U and C).

Let’s try placing U in position 3 and C in position 2:  
M C U _ _

We need two more letters from the allowed set for positions 4 and 5.  
Try M C U P D → “MCUPD” – invalid.  
Try M C U P Y – invalid.  
Try M C U B Y – invalid.

Instead, place U in position 5 and C in position 2:  
M C _ _ U  
Need 3 letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Try M C K P U – invalid.  
Try M C D Y U – invalid.  
Try M C P K U – invalid.

Try U in position 3 and C in position 4:  
M _ U C _  
Need 2 more letters for positions 2 and 5.  
Try M B U C K – “MBUCK” – invalid.  
Try M D U C K – “MDUCK” – invalid (word exists but is 5 letters).  
“MUCKY” – Y is allowed, but is “MUCKY” a word? Yes, it is.  
Check constraints:  
M(1) ✓, U(3) – allowed (new position), C(4) – allowed (new position), K(5), Y(2) – both allowed and not yet used.

Looks good.
