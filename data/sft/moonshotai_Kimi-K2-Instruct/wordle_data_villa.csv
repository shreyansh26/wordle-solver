For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are common consonants)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - very common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, N (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels), giving good coverage to potentially identify multiple letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- All letters except A are not in the word (C, R, N, E are marked x).
- A appears in the word but is in the wrong position (currently 3rd position).

So the secret word contains A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position. The other letters C,R,N,E are excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (since it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Doesn't use C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining consonants to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.
Vowels to try (besides A): O, I, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- SALTY (but contains S, A, L, T, Y - S and T are good consonants)
- PATIO (but P is less common)
- BLOAT (but contains O and T)
- STAMP (but contains S, T, M, P)

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3.
3. L is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ in SALTY).

So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _  with A somewhere other than position 2 or 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, I, U (since A is already known to be in the word).
Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (minus the excluded ones).

We need to pick a word that:
- Has length 5.
- Has L in position 3.
- Contains A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not excluded so far.

Possible words:
- BALMY: uses B, A, L, M, Y – but Y is excluded.
- FABLE: uses F, A, B, L, E – but E is excluded.
- VALOR: uses V, A, L, O, R – but R is excluded.
- GALAX: uses G, A, L, A, X – but X is acceptable.
- HALLO: uses H, A, L, L, O – double L is possible but not optimal.
- LAGOO: doesn’t fit the L in position 3.
- MANGO: doesn’t fit.
- PALSY: uses P, A, L, S, Y – but S and Y are excluded.

A better candidate: ""MADLY"" but D is allowed, M is allowed, A is allowed, L is in 3, Y is excluded. Doesn't work.
Another: ""GALOP"" but P is allowed, O is allowed, but G is allowed. Wait, it’s G A L O P – but L needs to be in position 3, so _ _ L _ _. ""GALOP"" has L in 3, uses G, A, L, O, P – none are excluded except we need to check if O and P are allowed. They are not yet excluded.

Another candidate: ""HALON"" – but N is excluded.
""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""CALIX"" – C is excluded.
""VALET"" – E, T excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y excluded.
""LAPSE"" – E, S excluded.

A good candidate: ""GALAX"" – G, A, L, A, X.
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in positions 2 and 4 (positions 2 or 4 are allowed since 3 is taken by L and we know A isn't in position 2 from SALTY – wait, in SALTY A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A can't be in position 2. So in GALAX, A is in positions 2 and 4, but position 2 is invalid. So GALAX is invalid because A is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y is excluded.
""VALOR"" – R is excluded.
""FABLE"" – E is excluded.

Let's think differently: _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using remaining letters.

Possible words:
- A L _ _ _: but L is in position 3, not 2.
- _ _ L A _: e.g., ""FLACK"" – C is excluded.
- _ _ L _ A: e.g., ""PLAZA"" – Z is allowed but P, L, A, Z, A. L is in 3, A in 4 and 5. But Z is allowed, but P is allowed. But we have double A.

Better approach: look for words with _ _ L _ _ and A in 1, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (so far): A, L, plus consonants not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate: ""FLAIL"" – but L is in position 3, A is in position 2 (invalid) and 4.
""GLAZE"" – E is excluded.
""PLAID"" – uses P, L, A, I, D.
- Pattern: P L A I D – but L must be in position 3, so this is P L A I D, which is positions 1-5: P, L, A, I, D. L is in position 2 here, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need L fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _.

Possible words:
- B O L A X – but not a valid word.
- D I L L Y – Y excluded, double L.
- H A L O S – S excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L E O – E excluded.
- V A L I D – D is allowed, V is allowed, A is allowed, I is allowed, L is in 3, D is allowed. This fits: V A L I D.

Let's check:
V A L I D:
- V: new letter.
- A: in the word, position 2 – but from SALTY, A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So VALID has A in position 2, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""G A L O P"" – G A L O P. L is in 3, A is in 2 (invalid).
""L A P I S"" – L is in 1, not 3.
""C L A M P"" – C excluded.
""F L A M E"" – E excluded.
""P L A I N"" – N excluded.
""B L A Z E"" – E, Z.

Hmm, need _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using allowed letters.

A in position 1: A _ L _ _ – e.g., A B L O W – not a word.
A in position 4: _ _ L A _ – e.g., B L A S T – S, T excluded.
F L A P S – S excluded.
G L A D S – S excluded.
P L A N K – N excluded.
B L A C K – C excluded.
M A L L Y – Y excluded.

A in position 5: _ _ L _ A – e.g., B L O W A – not a word.
F L O W A – not a word.
M A L L A – double L, double A, but L is fixed in 3, so _ M L _ A – not fitting.
S C R A M – letters excluded.
G U L P A – not a word.
H A L V A – but L is in 3, so H A L V A: H A L V A – positions 1-5: H, A, L, V, A. L is in 3, A in 2 and 5. But A cannot be in 2.

This is tricky. Maybe ""PLUGA"" – but not a valid word.
""FLORA"" – R excluded.
""ALOUD"" – L not in 3.
""AGLOW"" – L not in 3.

Let me list valid _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1, 4, or 5 and no excluded letters:

- B L A N K – N excluded.
- D U L L Y – Y excluded.
- F A L L A – L not in 3 (F A L L A: positions 1-5: F, A, L, L, A – L is in 3 and 4, but we need single L in 3).
- H A L V A – A in 2 (invalid).
- M A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P A L M Y – Y excluded.
- S A L S A – S excluded.
- T A L L Y – T, Y excluded.
- V A L I D – A in 2 (invalid).
- W A L L Y – Y excluded.
- G A L L Y – Y excluded.

This suggests that common _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1,4,5 and no excluded letters are rare. 

Re-examining: allowed letters are A, L, plus B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

Looking for _ _ L _ _:

- B O L U S – valid word, but A is not present. We know A must be in the word.
- J O L L Y – Y excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L I N – N excluded.
- D A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P O L K A – uses P, O, L, K, A. L is in 3, A is in 5. This fits!

""POLKA"":
- P: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (✓ from SALTY).
- K: allowed.
- A: in position 5 (allowed since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
- No excluded letters.

This seems optimal.
</think>

From the feedback:
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ L _ _ and A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits is ""POLKA"":
- P, O, L, K, A are all allowed.
- L is in position 3.
- A is in position 5 (valid).

- A L _ _ _: but L is in position 3, not 2.
- _ _ L A _: e.g., ""FLACK"" – C is excluded.
- _ _ L _ A: e.g., ""PLAZA"" – Z is allowed but P, L, A, Z, A. L is in 3, A in 4 and 5. But Z is allowed, but P is allowed. But we have double A.

Better approach: look for words with _ _ L _ _ and A in 1, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (so far): A, L, plus consonants not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate: ""FLAIL"" – but L is in position 3, A is in position 2 (invalid) and 4.
""GLAZE"" – E is excluded.
""PLAID"" – uses P, L, A, I, D.
- Pattern: P L A I D – but L must be in position 3, so this is P L A I D, which is positions 1-5: P, L, A, I, D. L is in position 2 here, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need L fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _.

Possible words:
- B O L A X – but not a valid word.
- D I L L Y – Y excluded, double L.
- H A L O S – S excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L E O – E excluded.
- V A L I D – D is allowed, V is allowed, A is allowed, I is allowed, L is in 3, D is allowed. This fits: V A L I D.

Let's check:
V A L I D:
- V: new letter.
- A: in the word, position 2 – but from SALTY, A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So VALID has A in position 2, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""G A L O P"" – G A L O P. L is in 3, A is in 2 (invalid).
""L A P I S"" – L is in 1, not 3.
""C L A M P"" – C excluded.
""F L A M E"" – E excluded.
""P L A I N"" – N excluded.
""B L A Z E"" – E, Z.

Hmm, need _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using allowed letters.

A in position 1: A _ L _ _ – e.g., A B L O W – not a word.
A in position 4: _ _ L A _ – e.g., B L A S T – S, T excluded.
F L A P S – S excluded.
G L A D S – S excluded.
P L A N K – N excluded.
B L A C K – C excluded.
M A L L Y – Y excluded.

A in position 5: _ _ L _ A – e.g., B L O W A – not a word.
F L O W A – not a word.
M A L L A – double L, double A, but L is fixed in 3, so _ M L _ A – not fitting.
S C R A M – letters excluded.
G U L P A – not a word.
H A L V A – but L is in 3, so H A L V A: H A L V A – positions 1-5: H, A, L, V, A. L is in 3, A in 2 and 5. But A cannot be in 2.

This is tricky. Maybe ""PLUGA"" – but not a valid word.
""FLORA"" – R excluded.
""ALOUD"" – L not in 3.
""AGLOW"" – L not in 3.

Let me list valid _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1, 4, or 5 and no excluded letters:

- B L A N K – N excluded.
- D U L L Y – Y excluded.
- F A L L A – L not in 3 (F A L L A: positions 1-5: F, A, L, L, A – L is in 3 and 4, but we need single L in 3).
- H A L V A – A in 2 (invalid).
- M A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P A L M Y – Y excluded.
- S A L S A – S excluded.
- T A L L Y – T, Y excluded.
- V A L I D – A in 2 (invalid).
- W A L L Y – Y excluded.
- G A L L Y – Y excluded.

This suggests that common _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1,4,5 and no excluded letters are rare. 

Re-examining: allowed letters are A, L, plus B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

Looking for _ _ L _ _:

- B O L U S – valid word, but A is not present. We know A must be in the word.
- J O L L Y – Y excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L I N – N excluded.
- D A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P O L K A – uses P, O, L, K, A. L is in 3, A is in 5. This fits!

""POLKA"":
- P: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (✓ from SALTY).
- K: allowed.
- A: in position 5 (allowed since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
- No excluded letters.

This seems optimal.From the feedback:
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ L _ _ and A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits is ""POLKA"":
- P, O, L, K, A are all allowed.
- L is in position 3.
- A is in position 5 (valid).",Guess 3: POLKA -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) L(✓) K(x) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are common consonants)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - very common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, N (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels), giving good coverage to potentially identify multiple letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- All letters except A are not in the word (C, R, N, E are marked x).
- A appears in the word but is in the wrong position (currently 3rd position).

So the secret word contains A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position. The other letters C,R,N,E are excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (since it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Doesn't use C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining consonants to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.
Vowels to try (besides A): O, I, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- SALTY (but contains S, A, L, T, Y - S and T are good consonants)
- PATIO (but P is less common)
- BLOAT (but contains O and T)
- STAMP (but contains S, T, M, P)

I'll choose ""SALTY"" as it uses common letters S, L, T and places A in position 2 (not 3), while avoiding the excluded letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(✓) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3.
3. L is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ in SALTY).

So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _  with A somewhere other than position 2 or 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, I, U (since A is already known to be in the word).
Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (minus the excluded ones).

We need to pick a word that:
- Has length 5.
- Has L in position 3.
- Contains A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not excluded so far.

Possible words:
- BALMY: uses B, A, L, M, Y – but Y is excluded.
- FABLE: uses F, A, B, L, E – but E is excluded.
- VALOR: uses V, A, L, O, R – but R is excluded.
- GALAX: uses G, A, L, A, X – but X is acceptable.
- HALLO: uses H, A, L, L, O – double L is possible but not optimal.
- LAGOO: doesn’t fit the L in position 3.
- MANGO: doesn’t fit.
- PALSY: uses P, A, L, S, Y – but S and Y are excluded.

A better candidate: ""MADLY"" but D is allowed, M is allowed, A is allowed, L is in 3, Y is excluded. Doesn't work.
Another: ""GALOP"" but P is allowed, O is allowed, but G is allowed. Wait, it’s G A L O P – but L needs to be in position 3, so _ _ L _ _. ""GALOP"" has L in 3, uses G, A, L, O, P – none are excluded except we need to check if O and P are allowed. They are not yet excluded.

Another candidate: ""HALON"" – but N is excluded.
""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""CALIX"" – C is excluded.
""VALET"" – E, T excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y excluded.
""LAPSE"" – E, S excluded.

A good candidate: ""GALAX"" – G, A, L, A, X.
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in positions 2 and 4 (positions 2 or 4 are allowed since 3 is taken by L and we know A isn't in position 2 from SALTY – wait, in SALTY A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A can't be in position 2. So in GALAX, A is in positions 2 and 4, but position 2 is invalid. So GALAX is invalid because A is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y is excluded.
""VALOR"" – R is excluded.
""FABLE"" – E is excluded.

Let's think differently: _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using remaining letters.

Possible words:
- A L _ _ _: but L is in position 3, not 2.
- _ _ L A _: e.g., ""FLACK"" – C is excluded.
- _ _ L _ A: e.g., ""PLAZA"" – Z is allowed but P, L, A, Z, A. L is in 3, A in 4 and 5. But Z is allowed, but P is allowed. But we have double A.

Better approach: look for words with _ _ L _ _ and A in 1, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (so far): A, L, plus consonants not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate: ""FLAIL"" – but L is in position 3, A is in position 2 (invalid) and 4.
""GLAZE"" – E is excluded.
""PLAID"" – uses P, L, A, I, D.
- Pattern: P L A I D – but L must be in position 3, so this is P L A I D, which is positions 1-5: P, L, A, I, D. L is in position 2 here, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need L fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _.

Possible words:
- B O L A X – but not a valid word.
- D I L L Y – Y excluded, double L.
- H A L O S – S excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L E O – E excluded.
- V A L I D – D is allowed, V is allowed, A is allowed, I is allowed, L is in 3, D is allowed. This fits: V A L I D.

Let's check:
V A L I D:
- V: new letter.
- A: in the word, position 2 – but from SALTY, A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So VALID has A in position 2, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""G A L O P"" – G A L O P. L is in 3, A is in 2 (invalid).
""L A P I S"" – L is in 1, not 3.
""C L A M P"" – C excluded.
""F L A M E"" – E excluded.
""P L A I N"" – N excluded.
""B L A Z E"" – E, Z.

Hmm, need _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using allowed letters.

A in position 1: A _ L _ _ – e.g., A B L O W – not a word.
A in position 4: _ _ L A _ – e.g., B L A S T – S, T excluded.
F L A P S – S excluded.
G L A D S – S excluded.
P L A N K – N excluded.
B L A C K – C excluded.
M A L L Y – Y excluded.

A in position 5: _ _ L _ A – e.g., B L O W A – not a word.
F L O W A – not a word.
M A L L A – double L, double A, but L is fixed in 3, so _ M L _ A – not fitting.
S C R A M – letters excluded.
G U L P A – not a word.
H A L V A – but L is in 3, so H A L V A: H A L V A – positions 1-5: H, A, L, V, A. L is in 3, A in 2 and 5. But A cannot be in 2.

This is tricky. Maybe ""PLUGA"" – but not a valid word.
""FLORA"" – R excluded.
""ALOUD"" – L not in 3.
""AGLOW"" – L not in 3.

Let me list valid _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1, 4, or 5 and no excluded letters:

- B L A N K – N excluded.
- D U L L Y – Y excluded.
- F A L L A – L not in 3 (F A L L A: positions 1-5: F, A, L, L, A – L is in 3 and 4, but we need single L in 3).
- H A L V A – A in 2 (invalid).
- M A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P A L M Y – Y excluded.
- S A L S A – S excluded.
- T A L L Y – T, Y excluded.
- V A L I D – A in 2 (invalid).
- W A L L Y – Y excluded.
- G A L L Y – Y excluded.

This suggests that common _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1,4,5 and no excluded letters are rare. 

Re-examining: allowed letters are A, L, plus B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

Looking for _ _ L _ _:

- B O L U S – valid word, but A is not present. We know A must be in the word.
- J O L L Y – Y excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L I N – N excluded.
- D A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P O L K A – uses P, O, L, K, A. L is in 3, A is in 5. This fits!

""POLKA"":
- P: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (✓ from SALTY).
- K: allowed.
- A: in position 5 (allowed since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
- No excluded letters.

This seems optimal.From the feedback:
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ L _ _ and A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits is ""POLKA"":

- L is in position 3.
- A is in position 5 (valid).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are common consonants)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - very common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, N (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels), giving good coverage to potentially identify multiple letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- All letters except A are not in the word (C, R, N, E are marked x).
- A appears in the word but is in the wrong position (currently 3rd position).

So the secret word contains A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position. The other letters C,R,N,E are excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (since it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Doesn't use C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining consonants to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.
Vowels to try (besides A): O, I, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- SALTY (but contains S, A, L, T, Y - S and T are good consonants)
- PATIO (but P is less common)
- BLOAT (but contains O and T)
- STAMP (but contains S, T, M, P)

I'll choose ""SALTY"" as it uses common letters S, L, T and places A in position 2 (not 3), while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>SALTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(✓) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3.
3. L is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ in SALTY).

So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _  with A somewhere other than position 2 or 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, I, U (since A is already known to be in the word).
Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (minus the excluded ones).

We need to pick a word that:
- Has length 5.
- Has L in position 3.
- Contains A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not excluded so far.

Possible words:
- BALMY: uses B, A, L, M, Y – but Y is excluded.
- FABLE: uses F, A, B, L, E – but E is excluded.
- VALOR: uses V, A, L, O, R – but R is excluded.
- GALAX: uses G, A, L, A, X – but X is acceptable.
- HALLO: uses H, A, L, L, O – double L is possible but not optimal.
- LAGOO: doesn’t fit the L in position 3.
- MANGO: doesn’t fit.
- PALSY: uses P, A, L, S, Y – but S and Y are excluded.

A better candidate: ""MADLY"" but D is allowed, M is allowed, A is allowed, L is in 3, Y is excluded. Doesn't work.
Another: ""GALOP"" but P is allowed, O is allowed, but G is allowed. Wait, it’s G A L O P – but L needs to be in position 3, so _ _ L _ _. ""GALOP"" has L in 3, uses G, A, L, O, P – none are excluded except we need to check if O and P are allowed. They are not yet excluded.

Another candidate: ""HALON"" – but N is excluded.
""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""CALIX"" – C is excluded.
""VALET"" – E, T excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y excluded.
""LAPSE"" – E, S excluded.

A good candidate: ""GALAX"" – G, A, L, A, X.
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in positions 2 and 4 (positions 2 or 4 are allowed since 3 is taken by L and we know A isn't in position 2 from SALTY – wait, in SALTY A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A can't be in position 2. So in GALAX, A is in positions 2 and 4, but position 2 is invalid. So GALAX is invalid because A is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y is excluded.
""VALOR"" – R is excluded.
""FABLE"" – E is excluded.

Let's think differently: _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using remaining letters.

Possible words:
- A L _ _ _: but L is in position 3, not 2.
- _ _ L A _: e.g., ""FLACK"" – C is excluded.
- _ _ L _ A: e.g., ""PLAZA"" – Z is allowed but P, L, A, Z, A. L is in 3, A in 4 and 5. But Z is allowed, but P is allowed. But we have double A.

Better approach: look for words with _ _ L _ _ and A in 1, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (so far): A, L, plus consonants not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate: ""FLAIL"" – but L is in position 3, A is in position 2 (invalid) and 4.
""GLAZE"" – E is excluded.
""PLAID"" – uses P, L, A, I, D.
- Pattern: P L A I D – but L must be in position 3, so this is P L A I D, which is positions 1-5: P, L, A, I, D. L is in position 2 here, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need L fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _.

Possible words:
- B O L A X – but not a valid word.
- D I L L Y – Y excluded, double L.
- H A L O S – S excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L E O – E excluded.
- V A L I D – D is allowed, V is allowed, A is allowed, I is allowed, L is in 3, D is allowed. This fits: V A L I D.

Let's check:
V A L I D:
- V: new letter.
- A: in the word, position 2 – but from SALTY, A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So VALID has A in position 2, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""G A L O P"" – G A L O P. L is in 3, A is in 2 (invalid).
""L A P I S"" – L is in 1, not 3.
""C L A M P"" – C excluded.
""F L A M E"" – E excluded.
""P L A I N"" – N excluded.
""B L A Z E"" – E, Z.

Hmm, need _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using allowed letters.

A in position 1: A _ L _ _ – e.g., A B L O W – not a word.
A in position 4: _ _ L A _ – e.g., B L A S T – S, T excluded.
F L A P S – S excluded.
G L A D S – S excluded.
P L A N K – N excluded.
B L A C K – C excluded.
M A L L Y – Y excluded.

A in position 5: _ _ L _ A – e.g., B L O W A – not a word.
F L O W A – not a word.
M A L L A – double L, double A, but L is fixed in 3, so _ M L _ A – not fitting.
S C R A M – letters excluded.
G U L P A – not a word.
H A L V A – but L is in 3, so H A L V A: H A L V A – positions 1-5: H, A, L, V, A. L is in 3, A in 2 and 5. But A cannot be in 2.

This is tricky. Maybe ""PLUGA"" – but not a valid word.
""FLORA"" – R excluded.
""ALOUD"" – L not in 3.
""AGLOW"" – L not in 3.

Let me list valid _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1, 4, or 5 and no excluded letters:

- B L A N K – N excluded.
- D U L L Y – Y excluded.
- F A L L A – L not in 3 (F A L L A: positions 1-5: F, A, L, L, A – L is in 3 and 4, but we need single L in 3).
- H A L V A – A in 2 (invalid).
- M A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P A L M Y – Y excluded.
- S A L S A – S excluded.
- T A L L Y – T, Y excluded.
- V A L I D – A in 2 (invalid).
- W A L L Y – Y excluded.
- G A L L Y – Y excluded.

This suggests that common _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1,4,5 and no excluded letters are rare. 

Re-examining: allowed letters are A, L, plus B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

Looking for _ _ L _ _:

- B O L U S – valid word, but A is not present. We know A must be in the word.
- J O L L Y – Y excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L I N – N excluded.
- D A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P O L K A – uses P, O, L, K, A. L is in 3, A is in 5. This fits!

""POLKA"":
- P: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (✓ from SALTY).
- K: allowed.
- A: in position 5 (allowed since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
- No excluded letters.

This seems optimal.From the feedback:
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ L _ _ and A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits is ""POLKA"":
- P, O, L, K, A are all allowed.
- L is in position 3.
- A is in position 5 (valid).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get from the feedback. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T are common consonants)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - very common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, N (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels), giving good coverage to potentially identify multiple letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- All letters except A are not in the word (C, R, N, E are marked x).
- A appears in the word but is in the wrong position (currently 3rd position).

So the secret word contains A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position. The other letters C,R,N,E are excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (since it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Doesn't use C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining consonants to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, etc.
Vowels to try (besides A): O, I, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- SALTY (but contains S, A, L, T, Y - S and T are good consonants)
- PATIO (but P is less common)
- BLOAT (but contains O and T)
- STAMP (but contains S, T, M, P)

I'll choose ""SALTY"" as it uses common letters S, L, T and places A in position 2 (not 3), while avoiding the excluded letters.

<guess>SALTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(✓) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.
2. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3.
3. L is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ in SALTY).

So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _  with A somewhere other than position 2 or 3.

Remaining vowels to consider: O, I, U (since A is already known to be in the word).
Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (minus the excluded ones).

We need to pick a word that:
- Has length 5.
- Has L in position 3.
- Contains A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not excluded so far.

Possible words:
- BALMY: uses B, A, L, M, Y – but Y is excluded.
- FABLE: uses F, A, B, L, E – but E is excluded.
- VALOR: uses V, A, L, O, R – but R is excluded.
- GALAX: uses G, A, L, A, X – but X is acceptable.
- HALLO: uses H, A, L, L, O – double L is possible but not optimal.
- LAGOO: doesn’t fit the L in position 3.
- MANGO: doesn’t fit.
- PALSY: uses P, A, L, S, Y – but S and Y are excluded.

A better candidate: ""MADLY"" but D is allowed, M is allowed, A is allowed, L is in 3, Y is excluded. Doesn't work.
Another: ""GALOP"" but P is allowed, O is allowed, but G is allowed. Wait, it’s G A L O P – but L needs to be in position 3, so _ _ L _ _. ""GALOP"" has L in 3, uses G, A, L, O, P – none are excluded except we need to check if O and P are allowed. They are not yet excluded.

Another candidate: ""HALON"" – but N is excluded.
""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""CALIX"" – C is excluded.
""VALET"" – E, T excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y excluded.
""LAPSE"" – E, S excluded.

A good candidate: ""GALAX"" – G, A, L, A, X.
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in positions 2 and 4 (positions 2 or 4 are allowed since 3 is taken by L and we know A isn't in position 2 from SALTY – wait, in SALTY A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A can't be in position 2. So in GALAX, A is in positions 2 and 4, but position 2 is invalid. So GALAX is invalid because A is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""MALIC"" – C is excluded.
""PALMY"" – Y is excluded.
""VALOR"" – R is excluded.
""FABLE"" – E is excluded.

Let's think differently: _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using remaining letters.

Possible words:
- A L _ _ _: but L is in position 3, not 2.
- _ _ L A _: e.g., ""FLACK"" – C is excluded.
- _ _ L _ A: e.g., ""PLAZA"" – Z is allowed but P, L, A, Z, A. L is in 3, A in 4 and 5. But Z is allowed, but P is allowed. But we have double A.

Better approach: look for words with _ _ L _ _ and A in 1, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (so far): A, L, plus consonants not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate: ""FLAIL"" – but L is in position 3, A is in position 2 (invalid) and 4.
""GLAZE"" – E is excluded.
""PLAID"" – uses P, L, A, I, D.
- Pattern: P L A I D – but L must be in position 3, so this is P L A I D, which is positions 1-5: P, L, A, I, D. L is in position 2 here, not 3. Doesn't fit.

Wait, we need L fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _.

Possible words:
- B O L A X – but not a valid word.
- D I L L Y – Y excluded, double L.
- H A L O S – S excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L E O – E excluded.
- V A L I D – D is allowed, V is allowed, A is allowed, I is allowed, L is in 3, D is allowed. This fits: V A L I D.

Let's check:
V A L I D:
- V: new letter.
- A: in the word, position 2 – but from SALTY, A was in position 2 and was marked (-), so A cannot be in position 2. So VALID has A in position 2, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""G A L O P"" – G A L O P. L is in 3, A is in 2 (invalid).
""L A P I S"" – L is in 1, not 3.
""C L A M P"" – C excluded.
""F L A M E"" – E excluded.
""P L A I N"" – N excluded.
""B L A Z E"" – E, Z.

Hmm, need _ _ L _ _ with A in 1, 4, or 5, and using allowed letters.

A in position 1: A _ L _ _ – e.g., A B L O W – not a word.
A in position 4: _ _ L A _ – e.g., B L A S T – S, T excluded.
F L A P S – S excluded.
G L A D S – S excluded.
P L A N K – N excluded.
B L A C K – C excluded.
M A L L Y – Y excluded.

A in position 5: _ _ L _ A – e.g., B L O W A – not a word.
F L O W A – not a word.
M A L L A – double L, double A, but L is fixed in 3, so _ M L _ A – not fitting.
S C R A M – letters excluded.
G U L P A – not a word.
H A L V A – but L is in 3, so H A L V A: H A L V A – positions 1-5: H, A, L, V, A. L is in 3, A in 2 and 5. But A cannot be in 2.

This is tricky. Maybe ""PLUGA"" – but not a valid word.
""FLORA"" – R excluded.
""ALOUD"" – L not in 3.
""AGLOW"" – L not in 3.

Let me list valid _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1, 4, or 5 and no excluded letters:

- B L A N K – N excluded.
- D U L L Y – Y excluded.
- F A L L A – L not in 3 (F A L L A: positions 1-5: F, A, L, L, A – L is in 3 and 4, but we need single L in 3).
- H A L V A – A in 2 (invalid).
- M A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P A L M Y – Y excluded.
- S A L S A – S excluded.
- T A L L Y – T, Y excluded.
- V A L I D – A in 2 (invalid).
- W A L L Y – Y excluded.
- G A L L Y – Y excluded.

This suggests that common _ _ L _ _ words with A in 1,4,5 and no excluded letters are rare. 

Re-examining: allowed letters are A, L, plus B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and vowels O, I, U.

Looking for _ _ L _ _:

- B O L U S – valid word, but A is not present. We know A must be in the word.
- J O L L Y – Y excluded.
- M A L I C – C excluded.
- P A L I N – N excluded.
- D A L L Y – Y excluded.
- P O L K A – uses P, O, L, K, A. L is in 3, A is in 5. This fits!

""POLKA"":
- P: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (✓ from SALTY).
- K: allowed.
- A: in position 5 (allowed since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
- No excluded letters.

This seems optimal.From the feedback:
- L is in the word and in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ L _ _ and A must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.

A word that fits is ""POLKA"":
- P, O, L, K, A are all allowed.
- L is in position 3.
- A is in position 5 (valid).

Let’s look at English words ending in “IL_A” with L in position 3 and I in position 2.  
The only common word that fits is **FILIA**, but it was already considered.  
Another is **GILIA** (a plant genus) – but it uses G, which is allowed.

I will choose “GILIA”: G I L I A.
- G: allowed (not previously excluded).  
- I: correct in 2.  
- L: correct in 3.  
- I: allowed in 4 (only marked wrong position earlier, but still in word).  
- A: correct in 5.
