Since this is the first guess, we have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good starting word would use a variety of these letters. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

- O(x) … O is not in the word.
- S(-) … S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

- Does NOT contain A or O.
- R cannot be in position 2, S cannot be in position 4, E cannot be in position 5.

Next step: choose a word that keeps R, S, E while avoiding A and O, and that puts R, S, E into new positions. Common remaining high-frequency letters are T, I, N, L, U, D, C, etc.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T, I, E, S, R – all allowed letters so far.
- R is now in position 5 (allowed), S in position 4 (invalid per feedback), so S is still wrong place.
Actually that reuses forbidden positions.

From both pieces of feedback:

1. Letters known to be in the word: R, S, E (each at least once).
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, I, N.
3. Position constraints so far:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 1.
   - S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
   - E cannot be in positions 5 or 2.

Therefore:
- R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5 (but 5 is already ruled out for S, not for R). Actually, from Guess 2, R was in position 1 there, and was marked (-), so R cannot be in position 1. There is no info yet that it cannot be in 2. Wait, let's re-examine:

For Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2.
For Guess 2 (REINS):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1.

So R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.

Similarly:
- From Guess 1 (AROSE) S(-) means S not in position 4.
- From Guess 2 (REINS) S(-) means S not in position 5.
So S must be in positions 1, 2 or 3.

- From Guess 1 (AROSE) E(-) means E not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (REINS) E(-) means E not in position 2.
So E must be in positions 1, 3 or 4.

Also, we know the word has no A, O, I, N.

So possible positions:
R: 3,4,5
S: 1,2,3
E: 1,3,4

We need a 5-letter word using R,S,E and two other letters (from remaining alphabet excluding A,O,I,N and the letters already placed). The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, U, D, C, etc.

Let's try to construct. Let's try R in position 3, S in 1, E in 4:
S _ R E _

Need two more letters, not A,O,I,N. Let's pick T and D: S T R E D. Is ""STRED"" a word? No.

Let's try E in 1, S in 2, R in 4:
E S _ R _

Need two letters. Try E S T R Y (""ESTRY"") - not a word.
E S T R A - contains A, invalid.
E S T R O - contains O, invalid.

Another approach: R in 5, S in 3, E in 1:
E _ S _ R
Need two letters. Try E L S E R - but E is repeated, maybe okay. ""ELSER"" - not a word.
E C S T R - ""ECSTR"" - no.

D S E R T - ""DSERT"" - no.
C S E R T - ""CSERT"" - no.

Alternative: R in 3, S in 2, E in 1:
E S R _ _

E S R T A - invalid (A).

R in 3, S in 1, E in 4:

S T R E W - ""STREW"" is a valid word! Means to scatter.

Let's check:
Letters: S,T,R,E,W - all allowed (no A,O,I,N).
Positions:
- S is in 1 - allowed (only restrictions were not 4 or 5).
- R is in 3 - allowed.

3. Position constraints so far:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 1.
   - S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
   - E cannot be in positions 5 or 2.

Therefore:
- R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5 (but 5 is already ruled out for S, not for R). Actually, from Guess 2, R was in position 1 there, and was marked (-), so R cannot be in position 1. There is no info yet that it cannot be in 2. Wait, let's re-examine:

For Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2.
For Guess 2 (REINS):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1.

So R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.

Similarly:
- From Guess 1 (AROSE) S(-) means S not in position 4.
- From Guess 2 (REINS) S(-) means S not in position 5.
So S must be in positions 1, 2 or 3.

- From Guess 1 (AROSE) E(-) means E not in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (REINS) E(-) means E not in position 2.
So E must be in positions 1, 3 or 4.

Also, we know the word has no A, O, I, N.

So possible positions:
R: 3,4,5
S: 1,2,3
E: 1,3,4

We need a 5-letter word using R,S,E and two other letters (from remaining alphabet excluding A,O,I,N and the letters already placed). The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, U, D, C, etc.

Let's try to construct. Let's try R in position 3, S in 1, E in 4:
S _ R E _

Need two more letters, not A,O,I,N. Let's pick T and D: S T R E D. Is ""STRED"" a word? No.

Let's try E in 1, S in 2, R in 4:
E S _ R _

Need two letters. Try E S T R Y (""ESTRY"") - not a word.
E S T R A - contains A, invalid.
E S T R O - contains O, invalid.

Another approach: R in 5, S in 3, E in 1:
E _ S _ R
Need two letters. Try E L S E R - but E is repeated, maybe okay. ""ELSER"" - not a word.
E C S T R - ""ECSTR"" - no.

R in 4, S in 2, E in 3:
_ S E R _
Need two letters. Try T S E R T - ""TSERT"" - no.
D S E R T - ""DSERT"" - no.
C S E R T - ""CSERT"" - no.

Alternative: R in 3, S in 2, E in 1:
E S R _ _
Need two letters. E S R U D - ""ESRUD"" - no.
E S R T A - invalid (A).

R in 3, S in 1, E in 4:
S _ R E _
S T R E W - ""STREW"" is a valid word! Means to scatter.

Let's check:
Letters: S,T,R,E,W - all allowed (no A,O,I,N).
Positions:
- S is in 1 - allowed (only restrictions were not 4 or 5).
- R is in 3 - allowed.
- E is in 4 - allowed.
T and W haven't been tested, but no constraints on them.

So ""STREW"" seems valid.

From the new feedback on STREW:
- S(✓) … S is correct in the 1st position.
- T(✓) … T is correct in the 2nd position.
- R(-) … R is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- E(✓) … E is correct in the 4th position.
- W(x) … W is not in the word.

So we now know the secret word pattern:
S T _ E _

Letters already placed:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: T (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)

Letters still needed:
- R must appear somewhere (feedback shows it is present), but cannot be in position 3.
So R must be in position 5.

Therefore, the word must be:
S T _ E R

The only missing letter is in position 3. It must be a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (cannot be A, O, I, N, W)
- Has not already been used in positions 1-2-4-5 (S, T, E, R)
Remaining common letters: L, U, C, D, B, etc.

The most common and likely fit is ""L"", forming the word ""STLER"" – but that's not a valid English word.

Next choices:
- ""STUER"" – invalid
- ""STDER"" – invalid
- ""ST CER"" – ""ST CER"" → ""ST"" + ""CER"" → ""ST CER"" → ""ST CER"" → ""ST CER"" → ""ST CER"" → Actually, ""ST CER"" is not valid.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter English words matching ""S T _ E R"":
- S T A R E – but A is invalid (from Guess 1)
- S T E R E – E already used in position 4
- S T I C K – too many letters invalid
- S T U D Y – doesn't match positions
- S T O N E – O is invalid
- S T I L E – I invalid
- S T A L E – A invalid
- S T R E W – already tried
- S T R I P – doesn't fit
- S T U N K – no
- S T R O K – no
- S T R E T – no
- S T R E T – no
- S T E R N – no
- S T E R E – no
- S T E R N – no

Looking up, the only valid common word matching ""S T _ E R"" is ""STEER"" – but that repeats the E. However, the feedback doesn't forbid letter repetition.

But in ""STEER"":
- S T E E R
  - 1:S ✓
  - 2:T ✓
  - 3:E – allowed (no restriction on E in position 3)
  - 4:E ✓ – but this would be the same as position 4, which is already E
  - 5:R – and this would satisfy the requirement that R must appear (and it would be in position 5, which is allowed since R was only forbidden from positions 1,2,3)

So ""STEER"" is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Valid English word: YES
- Matches pattern S T _ E R: S T E E R → S T (E) E R → but wait, this would have E in both 3rd and 4th positions, which is allowed unless forbidden. The feedback on R said it couldn't be in position 3, but that's satisfied here.
- Contains all required letters: S, T, R, E
- No forbidden letters: A, O, I, N, W

Thus, ""STEER"" is the logical next guess.
