For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". 

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and identify some consonants as well.

“COACT” – uses C, O, A, C, T but C twice and T is in banned position 5.

Another candidate: “COATL” (but that’s not an accepted English word).  
“COAPT” – not a common word.  
“COAST” – uses S, already ruled out.  

Let’s pick “COALT” – invalid.  
“COACT” – uses C, O, A, C, T but C twice and T is in banned position 5.

Let’s instead use “NATION” – too long.  
“ACTON” – 5 letters.  
ACTON uses A (allowed), C, T (allowed), O (allowed), N. T is in position 3 here, which is allowed.  
A is in position 1 – but that’s banned.  

Try “CANTO” – O in position 5, which is allowed, but T is in position 4, allowed.  
A in position 2 – allowed.  
Letters used: C, A, N, T, O – all new or confirmed, no banned letters.  
CANTO is a valid English word.

Therefore, I will guess CANTO.

Let's update our knowledge after the third guess CANTO.

Feedback for CANTO:
C(x) : C is not in the word.  
A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 2.  
N(x) : N is not in the word.  
T(-) : T is in the word but not in position 4.  
O(-) : O is in the word but not in position 5.

Full alphabet status so far:

Definitely in the word: A, O, T  
Definitely NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, U, C, N  

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Thus, the word contains exactly one A, one O, one T, plus two letters chosen from the still-possible set: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- Position 1: cannot be A, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → allowed: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, O.
- Position 2: cannot be A, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set.
- Position 3: cannot be O, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus O.
- Position 4: cannot be T, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus T.
- Position 5: cannot be O, T, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus O and T.

We have to place A, O, T and two new consonants while respecting restrictions.

A quick way to proceed is to pick a template and test two fresh consonants that are frequent. Let's try:

Template with A in 3, O in 2, T in 1: T O A _ _
Positions left: 4 and 5. Fill with two new letters, say L and D → TOALD (invalid). Change to loaded consonants L and M → T O A L M → TOALM (invalid). Swap to common ending: T O A M D (invalid).

Another template: T in 1, A in 4, O in 2 → T O _ A _. Fill 3 and 5 with new letters. T O P A L (looks good): letters are T, O, P, A, L. All unused letters P and L are still possible; positions satisfy all restrictions (A not in 1-2, O not in 3-5, T not in 4-5).

Check validity: ""TOPAL"" is a valid English word (a variant spelling of ""topal"" meaning cannon fodder, or the name Topal). It respects every constraint.

Therefore, I'll guess TOPAL.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and identify some consonants as well.

- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
3. Has A in positions 2-5 (since it can't be in position 1).

Good candidate letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess would maximize new information while respecting the constraints. ""ABOUT"" is often a strong follow-up, but it contains U and T which are still possible. However, ""ABOUT"" has O, which hasn't been ruled out yet. Let me check if it violates any constraints: ""ABOUT"" contains A (good), and doesn't contain R, I, S, E (good). The A is in position 2, which fits our constraint.

Another strong candidate is ""ABOUT"", but let me also consider ""ADOPT"" - but both have O. Since O hasn't been ruled out, that's fine. 

Let's go with ""ABOUT"" as it tests A, B, O, U, T - all new letters not yet tested.

- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1.

  – T cannot be in position 5.

Remaining alphabet letters: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and T above.

We have three confirmed letters (A, O, T) and need two more letters from the still-possible pool.  
We’d like to test new letters that are common yet unused: good candidates are C, D, L, N, P, M, etc.

Let’s try to build a word that:
- uses A, O, T, and two new consonants,
- respects the position bans,
- hasn’t been guessed before.

A good next word could be “CLANT” – but A is in position 4, which is allowed, and T is in position 5, which is banned for T.  
A better candidate is “CLOTH” – but we already know H hasn’t been tested yet; however, H has low frequency first, so let’s look for something more balanced.

Another candidate: “COATL” (but that’s not an accepted English word).  
“COAPT” – not a common word.  
“COAST” – uses S, already ruled out.  

Let’s pick “COALT” – invalid.  
“COACT” – uses C, O, A, C, T but C twice and T is in banned position 5.

Let’s instead use “NATION” – too long.  
“ACTON” – 5 letters.  
ACTON uses A (allowed), C, T (allowed), O (allowed), N. T is in position 3 here, which is allowed.  
A is in position 1 – but that’s banned.  

Try “CANTO” – O in position 5, which is allowed, but T is in position 4, allowed.  
A in position 2 – allowed.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". 

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and identify some consonants as well.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in the 1st position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
3. Has A in positions 2-5 (since it can't be in position 1).

Good candidate letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess would maximize new information while respecting the constraints. ""ABOUT"" is often a strong follow-up, but it contains U and T which are still possible. However, ""ABOUT"" has O, which hasn't been ruled out yet. Let me check if it violates any constraints: ""ABOUT"" contains A (good), and doesn't contain R, I, S, E (good). The A is in position 2, which fits our constraint.

Another strong candidate is ""ABOUT"", but let me also consider ""ADOPT"" - but both have O. Since O hasn't been ruled out, that's fine. 

Let's go with ""ABOUT"" as it tests A, B, O, U, T - all new letters not yet tested.

<guess>ABOUT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's process the new feedback from ABOUT:

A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.  
B(x) : B is not in the word.  
O(-) : O is in the word but not in position 3.  
U(x) : U is not in the word.  
T(-) : T is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of everything we know so far:
- Letters in the word: A (must appear once), O, T.
- Letters not in the word: R, I, S, E, B, U.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1.
  – O cannot be in position 3.
  – T cannot be in position 5.

Remaining alphabet letters: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and T above.

We have three confirmed letters (A, O, T) and need two more letters from the still-possible pool.  
We’d like to test new letters that are common yet unused: good candidates are C, D, L, N, P, M, etc.

Let’s try to build a word that:
- uses A, O, T, and two new consonants,
- respects the position bans,
- hasn’t been guessed before.

A good next word could be “CLANT” – but A is in position 4, which is allowed, and T is in position 5, which is banned for T.  
A better candidate is “CLOTH” – but we already know H hasn’t been tested yet; however, H has low frequency first, so let’s look for something more balanced.

Another candidate: “COATL” (but that’s not an accepted English word).  
“COAPT” – not a common word.  
“COAST” – uses S, already ruled out.  

Let’s pick “COALT” – invalid.  
“COACT” – uses C, O, A, C, T but C twice and T is in banned position 5.

Let’s instead use “NATION” – too long.  
“ACTON” – 5 letters.  
ACTON uses A (allowed), C, T (allowed), O (allowed), N. T is in position 3 here, which is allowed.  
A is in position 1 – but that’s banned.  

Try “CANTO” – O in position 5, which is allowed, but T is in position 4, allowed.  
A in position 2 – allowed.  
Letters used: C, A, N, T, O – all new or confirmed, no banned letters.  
CANTO is a valid English word.

Therefore, I will guess CANTO.

<guess>CANTO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(-)
Guess 3: CANTO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) N(x) T(-) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's update our knowledge after the third guess CANTO.

Feedback for CANTO:
C(x) : C is not in the word.  
A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 2.  
N(x) : N is not in the word.  
T(-) : T is in the word but not in position 4.  
O(-) : O is in the word but not in position 5.

Full alphabet status so far:

Definitely in the word: A, O, T  
Definitely NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, U, C, N  

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in position 3 or 5.
- T cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Thus, the word contains exactly one A, one O, one T, plus two letters chosen from the still-possible set: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- Position 1: cannot be A, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → allowed: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, O.
- Position 2: cannot be A, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set.
- Position 3: cannot be O, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus O.
- Position 4: cannot be T, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus T.
- Position 5: cannot be O, T, C, N, R, S, E, B, I, U → same set minus O and T.

We have to place A, O, T and two new consonants while respecting restrictions.

A quick way to proceed is to pick a template and test two fresh consonants that are frequent. Let's try:

Template with A in 3, O in 2, T in 1: T O A _ _
Positions left: 4 and 5. Fill with two new letters, say L and D → TOALD (invalid). Change to loaded consonants L and M → T O A L M → TOALM (invalid). Swap to common ending: T O A M D (invalid).

Another template: T in 1, A in 4, O in 2 → T O _ A _. Fill 3 and 5 with new letters. T O P A L (looks good): letters are T, O, P, A, L. All unused letters P and L are still possible; positions satisfy all restrictions (A not in 1-2, O not in 3-5, T not in 4-5).

Check validity: ""TOPAL"" is a valid English word (a variant spelling of ""topal"" meaning cannon fodder, or the name Topal). It respects every constraint.

Therefore, I'll guess TOPAL.
