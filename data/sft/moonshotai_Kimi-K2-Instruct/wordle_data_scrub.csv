For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain about the secret word. Common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they include frequently used letters and vowels. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong opener that includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they include frequently used letters and vowels. \n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it\'s a strong opener that includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the first guess (RAISE) the feedback was:\nR(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 1\nA(x)  → A is not in the word at all\nI(x)  → I is not in the word at all\nS(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 4\nE(x)  → E is not in the word at all\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters definitely excluded: A, I, E\n- Letters included somewhere but not in their guessed positions: R (not 1st), S (not 4th)\n\nI want a new word that:\n1.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Known facts:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- R is in position 3 (✓).
- Letters confirmed present: S, R, U.
- Letters confirmed absent: A, I, E, H, O, N, T, M.

So the pattern so far is:  
S _ R U _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, Y (and possibly others, but these are common).

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has R in position 3.
3. Has U in position 4.
4. Uses only letters from the allowed set above.
5. Tests new letters in positions 2 and 5.

Looking at common English words that fit S _ R U _, possibilities include:
- SCRUB (but B is ok, yet C is new)
- SPRUG (not a common word)
- SPURT (but T is excluded)
- SCURF (F is allowed)
- SPURM (M is excluded)

The most straightforward common word left appears to be SCRUB, which introduces C and B while keeping the known letters in place.

Therefore, I’ll guess SCRUB.
