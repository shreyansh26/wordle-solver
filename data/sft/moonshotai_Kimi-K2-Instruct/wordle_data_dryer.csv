Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback. My goal is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting choices include words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the two previous guesses:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)

   - R is confirmed in position 5.

So we now know the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 5.
- No A, I, S, T, O, W.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE feedback), but it is already locked in position 5, so that’s fine.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3, using letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that keeps E in 4 and R in 5, and introduces three new letters. A good candidate is “UNDER”:
- U, N, D have not been tested yet.
- E in 4 and R in 5 fit the current constraints.
- The word is valid.

However, I should verify that U, N, D have not been ruled out. Indeed, none of these letters appeared in the previous guesses, so they are available. This should give information about three new common letters at once.

From the feedback so far:

- E is in position 4.
- R is in position 5.
- Letters ruled out: A, I, S, T, O, W, U, N.
- D is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R with D somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining usable letters (not yet tested or ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 4 and R in position 5
2. Has D in position 1 or 2
3. Uses only letters from the remaining set

Possible candidates:
- D _ _ E R (D in position 1)
- _ D _ E R (D in position 2)

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in -ER with D in position 1 or 2:
- D + common consonant + vowel or consonant + E + R
- Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V

Good candidates:
- D + I + V + E + R → DIVER (but I is ruled out)
- D + A + R + E + R → DARER (A ruled out)
- D + A + N + C + E + R → DANCER (N ruled out, A ruled out)

- D + E + E + K + E + R → DECKER (too long)
- D + E + E + R + S → DEERS (S ruled out)

Let me try D in position 1:
- D _ _ E R
Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V
Vowels left: E (but already used), Y

- D + E + F + E + R → DEFER (F and E are allowed, D in 1, E in 2, F in 3, E in 4, R in 5)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,dryer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback. My goal is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting choices include words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain A, I, or S.
- It DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

Letters left to test: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, G, H, etc. and remaining vowels like O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that puts E in position 2 and R elsewhere (not 1), and uses new common letters. A good candidate is ""TOWER"":
- T, O, W are untested common letters.
- E is in position 2 (since it can’t be 5).
- R can be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- No A, I, or S are used.

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word but not in their guess positions (R≠1, E≠5).

2. TOWER → T(x) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.
   - R is confirmed in position 5.
   - T, O, W are not in the word at all.

So we now know the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 5.
- No A, I, S, T, O, W.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE feedback), but it is already locked in position 5, so that’s fine.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3, using letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that keeps E in 4 and R in 5, and introduces three new letters. A good candidate is “UNDER”:
- U, N, D have not been tested yet.
- E in 4 and R in 5 fit the current constraints.
- The word is valid.

However, I should verify that U, N, D have not been ruled out. Indeed, none of these letters appeared in the previous guesses, so they are available. This should give information about three new common letters at once.

   • E is confirmed in position 4, R in position 5.  
   • D is confirmed in position 1.  
   • F is not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now locked in as:  
D _ _ E R  
with the middle two letters unknown.

Letters already excluded:  
A, F, I, N, O, S, T, U, W

Letters still available (and never ruled out):  
B, C, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
plus E and R are already placed.

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, both from the allowed set, that make a valid English word.  
Common 5-letter words fitting D _ _ E R are rather rare, but one that comes to mind is DICER.  
- D is in position 1 (✓)  
- I is already excluded from the word (from Guess 1), so DICER is invalid.

Next try DUGER – but U is excluded.  
DAGER – A is excluded.  
DEGER – only one E allowed in most word lists, and it would duplicate E.  
DBLER – not a real word.  
D P or B in position 2 and H or L in position 3?  

The only remaining common word that actually exists is DICER, but I is banned.  
Another check: DUCER (slang, but U banned), DUPER (U banned), DYPER (Y rare), DYKER (K and Y).  

DYKER (a real word meaning one who builds dikes/embankments) uses only allowed letters:  
D, Y, K, E, R – none of these letters are banned, and it fits D _ _ E R.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,dryer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback. My goal is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting choices include words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain A, I, or S.
- It DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

Letters left to test: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, G, H, etc. and remaining vowels like O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that puts E in position 2 and R elsewhere (not 1), and uses new common letters. A good candidate is ""TOWER"":
- T, O, W are untested common letters.
- E is in position 2 (since it can’t be 5).
- R can be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- No A, I, or S are used.

<guess>TOWER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word but not in their guess positions (R≠1, E≠5).

2. TOWER → T(x) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.
   - R is confirmed in position 5.
   - T, O, W are not in the word at all.

So we now know the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 5.
- No A, I, S, T, O, W.
- R cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE feedback), but it is already locked in position 5, so that’s fine.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3, using letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that keeps E in 4 and R in 5, and introduces three new letters. A good candidate is “UNDER”:
- U, N, D have not been tested yet.
- E in 4 and R in 5 fit the current constraints.
- The word is valid.

However, I should verify that U, N, D have not been ruled out. Indeed, none of these letters appeared in the previous guesses, so they are available. This should give information about three new common letters at once.

Guess 3: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) D(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- E is in position 4.
- R is in position 5.
- Letters ruled out: A, I, S, T, O, W, U, N.
- D is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R with D somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining usable letters (not yet tested or ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 4 and R in position 5
2. Has D in position 1 or 2
3. Uses only letters from the remaining set

Possible candidates:
- D _ _ E R (D in position 1)
- _ D _ E R (D in position 2)

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in -ER with D in position 1 or 2:
- D + common consonant + vowel or consonant + E + R
- Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V

Good candidates:
- D + I + V + E + R → DIVER (but I is ruled out)
- D + A + R + E + R → DARER (A ruled out)
- D + A + N + C + E + R → DANCER (N ruled out, A ruled out)
- P + A + D + D + E + R → PADDER (but need 5 letters)
- D + E + E + R → DEER (too short)
- C + H + I + C + K + E + R → CHICKER (too long)
- L + E + A + D + E + R → LEADER (A ruled out, E already used)
- F + I + N + D + E + R → FINDER (I and N ruled out)
- B + L + A + D + E + R → BLADER (A ruled out)
- M + U + D + D + E + R → MUDDER (U ruled out)
- C + H + I + C + K + E + R → CHICKER (too long)

Looking for simpler words:
- D + E + E + R → DEER (too short, needs 5 letters)
- D + E + E + K + E + R → DECKER (too long)
- D + E + E + R + S → DEERS (S ruled out)
- D + E + E + R + Y → DEERY (not a word)

Let me try D in position 1:
- D _ _ E R
Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V
Vowels left: E (but already used), Y
Need two consonants in positions 2 and 3.

Possible combinations:
- D + B + L + E + R → DBLER (not a word)
- D + C + H + E + R → DCHER (not a word)
- D + G + L + E + R → DGLER (not a word)
- D + H + E + E + R → DHEER (not a word)
- D + P + L + E + R → DPLER (not a word)
- D + V + E + E + R → DVEER (not a word)

Try D in position 2:
- _ D _ E R
Let’s pick a common consonant for position 1 and consonant/vowel for position 3.

Good options:
- C + D + E + E + R → CDEER (not a word)
- M + D + E + E + R → MDEER (not a word)
- G + D + E + E + R → GDEER (not a word)
- B + D + E + E + R → BDEER (not a word)

Hmm, these aren't working. Let me think of actual words ending in -ER with D in position 1 or 2.

Common words:
- D + E + B + E + R → DEBER (not standard)
- D + E + E + R + S → DEERS (S ruled out)
- D + E + E + R + Y → DEERY (not standard)
- D + E + F + E + R → DEFER (F and E are allowed, D in 1, E in 2, F in 3, E in 4, R in 5)

DEFER fits all constraints:
- D in position 1 (not ruled out)
- E in 2 and 4 (position 4 is correct, position 2 is okay since E can be anywhere except 5)
- F in 3 (not tested)
- R in 5 (correct)
- No ruled-out letters

Let me check DEFER:
- Letters used: D, E, F, E, R
- D: not ruled out, position 1 is allowed
- E: allowed, only position 5 was ruled out
- F: not ruled out
- R: correct in position 5

DEFER is a valid English word. Let’s go with it.

We now know the word has the fixed pattern D _ _ E R, with positions 1, 4, and 5 already locked in:

D _ _ E R

Letters still banned (from earlier): A, F, I, K, N, O, S, T, U, W, Y  
Letters still allowed (not yet used or ruled out): B, C, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

From Guess 5 we learned:
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
  Since the only open positions are 2 and 3, Y must be in position 3.

So the pattern becomes: D _ Y E R

We need one single letter for position 2 that is allowed (B, C, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z) and that forms a valid English word.

Quick scan of dictionary words matching D ? Y E R:
- BUYER – B is allowed, real word.
- CUYER – not a standard word.
- GUYER – “guyer” is archaic/rare and U is banned anyway.
- HUYER – not a word.
- JUYER – not a word.
- LUYER – not a word.
- PUYER – not a word.
- VUYER – not a word.
- etc.

Only BUYER is a common English word, and it uses B (still allowed).

Therefore BUYER is the logical next (and final) guess.
