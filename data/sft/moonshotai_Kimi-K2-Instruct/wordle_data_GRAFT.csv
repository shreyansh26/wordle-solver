For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters at once, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

From the feedback:

- A(-)  – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- O(x) – O is **not** in the word.
- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.
- E(x) – E is **not** in the word.

So we know:
1. R is in position 2.
2. A exists somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
3. O, S, E are out.
4. We need 5-letter words that have R in the second spot and contain A somewhere else, but no O/S/E.

Possible candidate letters left (excluding O,S,E) include: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good next guesses maximize information gain. A word like ""DRAIN"" won't work (contains I and N, but also A and R correctly placed). Instead, let’s try ""BRAND"":
- B (new consonant)
- R (correct position)
- A (exists, new position)
- N (new consonant)
- D (new consonant)

This tests new letters while respecting known constraints (R in position 2, A present elsewhere, no O/S/E).

We need to test new letters efficiently. Let's try:
- Position 1: F, G, H, K, L, T are common starting consonants still available
- Position 4: Could be vowel (I, U, Y) or consonant
- Position 5: Often a vowel or common ending like K

Good candidates would test multiple new letters. ""GRAIL"" would be good but L hasn't been tested and I hasn't been tested for position 4. However, let's try ""GRAIL"":
- G - new, allowed
- R - confirmed
- A - confirmed

But we need to be careful - A is confirmed in position 3, so any word must have A in position 3. So GRAIL would be G R A I L - this fits our pattern perfectly and tests G, I, L which are all new.

GRAIL uses:

This seems optimal as it tests 3 new letters in valid positions.

But let's double-check the pattern:

GRAIL would be G R A I L - this matches exactly with R in 2 and A in 3.

Another good alternative would be ""FRAIL"" but it also tests F and L which are new. Between F and G, both are equally good, but let's go with GRAIL.

Actually, let me reconsider - we might want to test more vowels. Since U is still available, maybe ""GRAUL"" but this isn't a valid word. ""GRAIL"" is valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,GRAFT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters at once, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- A(-)  – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- O(x) – O is **not** in the word.
- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.
- E(x) – E is **not** in the word.

So we know:
1. R is in position 2.
2. A exists somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
3. O, S, E are out.
4. We need 5-letter words that have R in the second spot and contain A somewhere else, but no O/S/E.

Possible candidate letters left (excluding O,S,E) include: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good next guesses maximize information gain. A word like ""DRAIN"" won't work (contains I and N, but also A and R correctly placed). Instead, let’s try ""BRAND"":
- B (new consonant)
- R (correct position)
- A (exists, new position)
- N (new consonant)
- D (new consonant)

This tests new letters while respecting known constraints (R in position 2, A present elsewhere, no O/S/E).

4. Five-letter pattern so far: _ R A _ _
5. Still-unused common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y … plus remaining vowels I and U.

4. Since we have only two blanks left and very few letters untested, let’s use the most common ones first.
   Try a word that uses remaining high-frequency letters while fitting G R A _ _.
   Graft, Gravy, Grate, Grasp, etc. are ruled out by eliminated letters.

   Looking at what’s left:
   - GRAFT (F, T still valid)
   - GRAKH (H, K still valid)
   - GRAKU (U valid)
   - GRAKY (Y valid)

   Among these, GRAFT uses two common untested letters (F and T) and is a real word.

So let’s guess GRAFT.",Guess 5: GRAFT -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
