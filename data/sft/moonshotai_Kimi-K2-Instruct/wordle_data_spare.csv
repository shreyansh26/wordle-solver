1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gained. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes the very common letters C, R, A, N, and E, which appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern looks like: _ _ A _ E, and R is somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5). Since A and E are already placed, R cannot be in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,spare,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gained. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes the very common letters C, R, A, N, and E, which appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern looks like: _ _ A _ E, and R is somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5). Since A and E are already placed, R cannot be in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- R _ A _ E
- _ _ A R E

Now I need a new word that:
- Keeps A in position 3 and E in position 5
- Does not use C or N
- Uses R in a different position (not 2)
- Uses new letters to gain more information

Good candidates: DRAKE, BRAVE, GRADE, FRAME, SHARE
I'll choose DRAKE because it tests D, K in new positions while placing R in position 1.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
2. DRAKE → D(x) R(-) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)

Therefore:
- Positions 3 and 5 are fixed: _ _ A _ E
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (from guesses 1 and 2). That leaves positions 4 as the only remaining spot for R, so the pattern must be _ _ A R E.
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, D, K.

We still need to test positions 1 and 2. Good letters left to try include B, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y. I’ll pick the common pair “B L” to form BLARE; it re-uses A, R, E and tests B and L.

Current known information:
- Word pattern: S _ A R E
- Excluded letters so far: C, N, D, K, B, L, T, H
- Remaining untested common consonants: F, G, M, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I, O, U

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with S, having A in position 3, R in 4, E in 5, and an unused consonant in position 2.

Looking at common valid words fitting S _ A R E:
- SFARE - not valid
- SGARE - not valid
- SMARE - not valid
- SPARE - P is untested and valid
- SVARE - not valid
- SWARE - archaic, not standard
- SYARE - not valid
- SCARE - C is excluded
- SNARE - N is excluded
- SHAVE - wrong pattern

The only valid remaining word is SPARE.

SPARE hasn't been tested yet, uses P (which hasn't been ruled out), and fits the pattern perfectly.

Since this is our 6th and final guess, we have to go with the most logical remaining option.
