For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes:

- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, T, N, S, L, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives us a good spread of letters and positions to work with.

Current knowledge:

Current constraints:
- Fifth letter is E (✓).
- Fourth letter is S (✓).
- First letter is R (from ROUSE feedback: R(-)) — but this must have been a typo; the feedback for ROUSE was R(-), O(x), U(-), S(✓), E(✓). So:
  - R: in the word but wrong position (currently in position 1, so R must be in positions 2 or 3).
  - S: correct in position 4.
  - E: correct in position 5.
  - O: not in the word (x).
  - U: in the word but wrong position (position 3 in ROUSE, so U must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, but not 3 again).

Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, H, I, N, O.
Letters confirmed: S (position 4), E (position 5), R (somewhere), U (somewhere).

Possible positions:
- Word structure: _ _ _ S E
- R must be in position 2 or 3.
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 3 if R is in 3).

Possible arrangements:
1. U R _ S E (U in 1, R in 2)
2. U _ R S E (U in 1, R in 3)
3. R U _ S E (R in 1 is invalid because R was in position 1 in ROUSE and marked wrong place, so R cannot be in position 1)
4. _ U R S E (U in 2, R in 3)
5. _ R U S E (R in 2, U in 3)

But U was in position 3 in ROUSE and marked wrong place (-), so U cannot be in position 3. So:
- Valid arrangements:
  1. U R _ S E
  2. _ U R S E
  3. R U _ S E (invalid, R cannot be in 1)
  4. _ R U S E (invalid, U cannot be in 3)

So possible:
- U R _ S E: third letter must be a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, H, I, N, O) and not R, S, E, U.
  Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Common ones: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P.
  Words: UR*SE. ""URISE"" is not a word. ""URASE"" is not a word. ""URDSE"" is not. Not many options.

- _ U R S E: first letter must be a letter not ruled out and not R, S, E, U.
  Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Words: *URSE. Possible: BURSE, CURSE, DURSE (invalid), FURSE (invalid), GURSE (invalid), etc.
  Valid English words: BURSE, CURSE, PURSE.

Between these, CURSE is a valid word and uses C which hasn't been tested yet.
