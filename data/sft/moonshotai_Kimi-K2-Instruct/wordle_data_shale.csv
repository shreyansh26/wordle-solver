For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any.

One excellent first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good chance of identifying several letters and their positions early on.

From the feedback on SLATE:

S is correct in the first position (S _ _ _ _).
A is correct in the third position (_ _ A _ _).
E is correct in the fifth position (_ _ _ _ E).
L appears in the word but not in the second position.
T is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ A _ E

Letters to keep: S, A, E in their confirmed positions.
Letters to avoid in position 2: anything that’s not L (but L must be used elsewhere).
Letters to avoid entirely: T.

Filling in the blanks with common remaining consonants and vowels that fit the pattern, a good candidate is “SHARE”.

- R: common consonant, not used yet.
