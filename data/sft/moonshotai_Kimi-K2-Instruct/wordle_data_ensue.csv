For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities quickly. The best starting words typically have:

1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters
4. Letters in different positions to maximize information

Looking at frequency analysis, some of the best starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, CRATE, SLANT, etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- C is a common starting consonant
- R is a very common consonant
- A is the most common vowel
- N is a common consonant
- E is the most common letter in English
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(-): N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- The word contains N somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain C, R, or A.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): S, T, I, O, L, U, D, G, H, etc.

I want a new word that:
1. Has E in the 5th position (locked in).
2. Has N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
   Since E is already in 5, N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
3. Avoids C, R, A.
4. Introduces new common letters.

Let’s try “STONE”:
- S (new), T (new), O (new), N (in position 4, but feedback says N is not in position 4, so this is bad).

Next idea: “UNTIE” — but N is in position 2 here, which is allowed. However, this has T in position 4 but E is already locked in 5. Also, I is new. Wait, but U is new, N is in 2, T is new, I is new, E is 5. But this has N in 2, which is allowed.

But I need to check: the word must be valid and maximize info. Another option: “SNIPE” — but P is less common. “DINER” — but R is ruled out. “LINED” — but D is less common and N is in 3, which is allowed. “MENUS” — but S is new, but E is already in 5, N is in 2, etc.

A better word might be “UNTIE” or “INSET” — let me pick one with high-frequency letters and N not in 4. “INSET” has N in 2, S new, T new, I new, E in 5. Looks good.

But let’s choose “UNTIE”:
- U (new), N (position 2, allowed), T (new), I (new), E (position 5, locked).

- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.

Combining everything we now know:
- 1st letter: not C, R, A, T, or I.
- 2nd letter: N (fixed).
- 3rd letter: unknown, but not C, R, A, T, I.
- 4th letter: unknown, but not C, R, A, T, I, and must be compatible with U(-) (so U could be here).
- 5th letter: E (fixed).

Also, the word must contain U somewhere, so U must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 1 is ruled out by U(-)).

We’re looking for a word of the form: _ N _ _ E  
with U in either position 3 or 4, and avoiding C, R, A, T, I.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

If U is in position 3:
- N U _ E : but we need a 5-letter word, so it would be _ N U _ E.  
  Possible words: HUNGE (invalid), LUNGE (invalid), PUNGE (invalid), BUNGE (invalid), MUNGE (invalid), DUNGE (invalid), etc. None of these are valid words.

If U is in position 4:
- _ N _ U E  
  Possible words: 
  - S N A U E (invalid)
  - D N O U E (invalid)
  - B N O U E (invalid)
  - L N O U E (invalid)
  - S N O U E (invalid)
  - F N O U E (invalid)
  - G N O U E (invalid)
  - H N O U E (invalid)
  - M N O U E (invalid)
  - P N O U E (invalid)
  - W N O U E (invalid)
  - Y N O U E (invalid)
  - V N O U E (invalid)
  
  The only valid word I can think of is ""SNUKE"" (but that’s not valid), or ""FLUME"" (but N is not in position 2). 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ N _ _ E, with U somewhere (position 3 or 4), and avoiding C, R, A, T, I. 

Possible valid words:
- S N O U E (invalid)
- F L U N E (but N must be in position 2)
- S N A U E (invalid)
- B N O U E (invalid)
- D O U N E (invalid)

Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""FLUME"" but N is not in position 2 there. 

Let me try another approach. The word is _ N _ _ E, must contain U in 3 or 4, and avoid C, R, A, T, I.

Valid words:
- ""FLUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SNUKE"" — invalid.
- ""PLUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SHONE"" — no U.
- ""SPUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SLIME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""CLONE"" — C is ruled out.
- ""GLOVE"" — no N in position 2.
- ""BLOKE"" — no N in position 2.

This seems limiting. Maybe I missed some. Let me think of words with N in position 2 and E in position 5, and U somewhere else:

- ""UNITE"" — but I is ruled out.
- ""UNDER"" — R is ruled out.
- ""UNKET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNLET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNMET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNPET"" — invalid.
- ""UNSET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UPEND"" — D is possible, but U is in position 1, which is ruled out by U(-).
- ""ONSET"" — T is ruled out, O is possible.
- ""ANODE"" — A is ruled out.
- ""ELUDE"" — L is possible, D is possible, U is in position 3, E in 5, N in 2 — but N is not here.
- ""ENURE"" — N is in position 2, U in 3, E in 5 — but does it contain E in 5 and N in 2? Wait, ""ENURE"" is E N U R E — R is ruled out.
- ""ENSUE"" — E N S U E — but E is in 5, N is in 2, U is in 4. This fits:
   - _ N _ U E
   - S is new, valid.
   - Avoids C, R, A, T, I.
   - U is in position 4, which is allowed (U(-) only rules out position 1).
   - N is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).

  Possible words: 
  - S N A U E (invalid)
  - D N O U E (invalid)
  - B N O U E (invalid)
  - L N O U E (invalid)
  - S N O U E (invalid)
  - F N O U E (invalid)
  - G N O U E (invalid)
  - H N O U E (invalid)
  - M N O U E (invalid)
  - P N O U E (invalid)
  - W N O U E (invalid)
  - Y N O U E (invalid)
  - V N O U E (invalid)
  
  The only valid word I can think of is ""SNUKE"" (but that’s not valid), or ""FLUME"" (but N is not in position 2). 

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ N _ _ E, with U somewhere (position 3 or 4), and avoiding C, R, A, T, I. 

Possible valid words:
- S N O U E (invalid)
- F L U N E (but N must be in position 2)
- S N A U E (invalid)
- B N O U E (invalid)
- D O U N E (invalid)

Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""FLUME"" but N is not in position 2 there. 

Let me try another approach. The word is _ N _ _ E, must contain U in 3 or 4, and avoid C, R, A, T, I.

Valid words:
- ""FLUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SNUKE"" — invalid.
- ""PLUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SHONE"" — no U.
- ""SPUME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""SLIME"" — no N in position 2.
- ""CLONE"" — C is ruled out.
- ""GLOVE"" — no N in position 2.
- ""BLOKE"" — no N in position 2.

This seems limiting. Maybe I missed some. Let me think of words with N in position 2 and E in position 5, and U somewhere else:

- ""UNITE"" — but I is ruled out.
- ""UNDER"" — R is ruled out.
- ""UNKET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNLET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNMET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UNPET"" — invalid.
- ""UNSET"" — T is ruled out.
- ""UPEND"" — D is possible, but U is in position 1, which is ruled out by U(-).
- ""ONSET"" — T is ruled out, O is possible.
- ""ANODE"" — A is ruled out.
- ""ELUDE"" — L is possible, D is possible, U is in position 3, E in 5, N in 2 — but N is not here.
- ""ENURE"" — N is in position 2, U in 3, E in 5 — but does it contain E in 5 and N in 2? Wait, ""ENURE"" is E N U R E — R is ruled out.
- ""ENSUE"" — E N S U E — but E is in 5, N is in 2, U is in 4. This fits:
   - _ N _ U E
   - S is new, valid.
   - Avoids C, R, A, T, I.
   - U is in position 4, which is allowed (U(-) only rules out position 1).
   - N is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).

""ENSUE"" seems to fit all criteria.",Guess 3: ENSUE -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
