For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it uses S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. Another excellent choice is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage of the most frequent letters.

From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 1st position.  
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
I(✓) – I is correct in the 3rd position.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is correct in the 5th position.

So the word must look like: _ _ I _ E  
It also contains R somewhere (not position 1) and does NOT contain A or S.

Possible single-consonant openings: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Let’s look at promising patterns:
- -R-IE: TRIPE (but P might be allowed) – wait, we used P and T so far not ruled out.
- CRIKE, DRIPE, FRISE – but S is out, so FRISE is invalid.
- BRIEF – uses F which is still possible.
- TRIPE – T is possible, P is possible.
- DRIVE – V is possible.

BRIEF seems strong: B R I E F – positions: 1=B (allowed), 2=R (allowed – R can now be in position 2), 3=I (correct), 4=E (but E must be in 5th position) – oops, that’s wrong. E must be last. So BRIEF is invalid because E would be in 4th.

We need _ _ I _ E with R somewhere else. Let’s try CRIME:
C R I M E – R is in position 2 (allowed), I in 3, E in 5, M is new letter. No A or S. Looks good.

Another candidate: PRIME – but P is okay, but same structure.  
TRICE – C is okay, but again checking letters: T, R, I, C, E – all letters are new or allowed, R not in 1st, I and E fixed, no A or S. TRICE seems valid.

Between CRIME and TRICE, both fit. I’ll go with CRIME as C and M are good letters to test.

But wait – CRIME: C R I M E – positions: 1=C, 2=R (allowed), 3=I, 4=M, 5=E. No conflicts. Let’s lock it in.

So the pattern is now:

Also, R is already in position 2, so it can't appear elsewhere (unless it's a double letter, but that's less common).

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, T, W, etc. (cannot be C because C is in but not at 1)
Possible letters for position 4: Any consonant except M, S, and any already in the pattern (only R, I, E are fixed, so can reuse letters unless they conflict)

Looking for common words fitting _ R I _ E:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common starter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). However, I think ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it uses S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. Another excellent choice is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage of the most frequent letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 1st position.  
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
I(✓) – I is correct in the 3rd position.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is correct in the 5th position.

So the word must look like: _ _ I _ E  
It also contains R somewhere (not position 1) and does NOT contain A or S.

Possible single-consonant openings: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Let’s look at promising patterns:
- -R-IE: TRIPE (but P might be allowed) – wait, we used P and T so far not ruled out.
- CRIKE, DRIPE, FRISE – but S is out, so FRISE is invalid.
- BRIEF – uses F which is still possible.
- TRIPE – T is possible, P is possible.
- DRIVE – V is possible.

BRIEF seems strong: B R I E F – positions: 1=B (allowed), 2=R (allowed – R can now be in position 2), 3=I (correct), 4=E (but E must be in 5th position) – oops, that’s wrong. E must be last. So BRIEF is invalid because E would be in 4th.

We need _ _ I _ E with R somewhere else. Let’s try CRIME:
C R I M E – R is in position 2 (allowed), I in 3, E in 5, M is new letter. No A or S. Looks good.

Another candidate: PRIME – but P is okay, but same structure.  
TRICE – C is okay, but again checking letters: T, R, I, C, E – all letters are new or allowed, R not in 1st, I and E fixed, no A or S. TRICE seems valid.

Between CRIME and TRICE, both fit. I’ll go with CRIME as C and M are good letters to test.

But wait – CRIME: C R I M E – positions: 1=C, 2=R (allowed), 3=I, 4=M, 5=E. No conflicts. Let’s lock it in.

<guess>CRIME</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on CRIME:

C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 1.  
R(✓) – R is correct in position 2.  
I(✓) – I is correct in position 3.  
M(x) – M is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: Not C, not A, not S, and not any other letters we've ruled out (A, S, M). Must be a consonant.
- Position 4: Must be a consonant (since E is fixed at 5), and cannot be M or S or any other letter we've ruled out.

Also, R is already in position 2, so it can't appear elsewhere (unless it's a double letter, but that's less common).

Looking at the pattern: _ R I _ E

Letters used/ruled out so far:
- R, I, E are fixed
- A, S, M are out
- C is in but not at position 1

Possible letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, T, W, etc. (cannot be C because C is in but not at 1)
Possible letters for position 4: Any consonant except M, S, and any already in the pattern (only R, I, E are fixed, so can reuse letters unless they conflict)

Looking for common words fitting _ R I _ E:
- TRIBE: T R I B E – B is allowed, T is allowed. No conflicts.
- PRIZE: P R I Z E – but Z might be too uncommon, and P is allowed.
- FRISE: S is out, so invalid.
- BRIDE: B R I D E – D allowed, B allowed.
- GRIME: M is out.
- DRIFT: Doesn't end with E.
- CRIBS: Doesn't fit.

Best candidates: TRIBE, BRIDE, PRIZE. Among these, TRIBE and BRIDE seem more common. I'll choose TRIBE as it uses T, which is a very common letter.

Check: T R I B E – positions: 1=T (allowed), 2=R (correct), 3=I (correct), 4=B, 5=E (correct). No A, S, M. C is in but not at 1 (currently T is at 1, so C could still be at 4, but B is fine). This seems valid.
