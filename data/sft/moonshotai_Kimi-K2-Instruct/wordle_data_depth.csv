For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information
2. Has no repeated letters to test more distinct letters
3. Contains vowels to help identify vowel positions
4. Uses frequently appearing consonants

Based on letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. 

A good strategic first guess would be ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It has no repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It can help identify both vowel positions and consonant positions

From the two guesses we have the following confirmed facts:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I  
Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions so far):
- T (from UNTIE: T(-) means T exists but is not in position 3)
- E (from AROSE and UNTIE: E(-) each time means E exists but is not in position 5, nor in position 4)

We still have 5 unknown positions.  We need to test new common letters while keeping the known letters T and E in new positions.  Other frequent letters we have not tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y.

A strategic third guess should:
1. Include both T and E in different positions than before.
2. Use fresh, high-frequency English letters.
3. Avoid any confirmed absent letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, I).

Let’s place T in position 1 and E in position 2, and fill the rest with fresh common consonants.  
A good candidate: “THEFT” – but it repeats T.  
Another candidate: “TEMPO” – contains O (already excluded).  
Candidate: “TELLY” – uses Y and two L’s (L is fresh, but double letter is okay).  
Candidate: “TWEED” – uses W and D, double E is okay, but E repeats.  

Better: “TEMPY” – but P and Y are fresh, but M was not excluded yet.  Actually M is still possible.

I’ll choose “TEMPY” because:
- T is now in position 1 (new placement).
- E is now in position 2 (new placement).
- M, P, Y have not been tested.
- All letters are fresh except T and E which are confirmed to be in the word.

Let’s distill all the clues so far.

Letters absolutely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, M, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word:
- T  (from both UNTIE and TEMPY, always “-” so far)
- E  (✓ at position 2 in TEMPY, so E is fixed in slot 2)
- P  (from TEMPY marked “-”, so P exists but is not in position 4)

Known fixed letter:  
E is at position 2.

So the pattern is:  
[ _ , E , _ , _ , _ ]

Remaining letters to test (all still legal):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the already-correct T and P.

Next move:
- Place T in a new, still-untested slot (3, 4, or 5).  
- Place P in a new slot (1, 3, 4, or 5).  
- Fill the two remaining slots with fresh, high-frequency consonants (C, D, L, etc.).

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:  
- CLEFT   → C, L, F, T, E — but F not tested yet, and L not excluded.  
- TEPID   → already uses I (excluded).  
- TEPAL   → uses A (excluded).  
- TEPED   → uses E twice—invalid.  
- TEPPY   → Y excluded.  
- TEPIC   → I excluded.  

A better fit:  
T E P _ _ is impossible because P would then repeat at 3 and it can’t be in 4.  

We need P not at 4, and T not at 1 or 3.  
So place P in 1 or 3 or 5 and T in 3 or 4 or 5.

Try P E T _ _ → PETAL, PETAL has A (excluded).  
Try _ E P T _ → HEPTA → H, E, P, T, A → A excluded.  

Try _ E _ P T → C E L P T → no duplicates, all letters still legal.  
Word: CELPT – not valid English.  

Valid word: “CEPT?” – no.  

Let’s pick fresh consonants and produce a legal word:

Word must fit:  
- E at 2.  
- Must contain T and P somewhere else.  
- No forbidden letters.

Candidate:  
C E P T _ → CEP T _ – invalid.  
H E P T _ → HEPTA – invalid.  
L E P T _ → LEPTA – invalid.  

Another route: include T and P in new positions and use fresh consonants.

Build:  
_ E T P _ → BET P _ – BET P T → BET P _ – BET P T is BETTP (invalid).  

Valid word: W E P T _ – nothing.  

Real solution:  
“W E D P T” – invalid.  

Let’s list remaining high-frequency consonants: C, D, L, K, B, G, H.

Pick:  
- T at 4, P at 3.  
Then pattern:  
_ E P T _  
Need one consonant for 1 and one for 5, both fresh.

Word: B E P T A → A excluded.  
D E P T H → DEPTH.

Check:  
- D, E, P, T, H – all letters still allowed.  
- E fixed at 2.  
- T appears at 4 (new spot).  
- P appears at 3 (new spot).  
- Valid English word.

Therefore the next logical guess is DEPTH.
