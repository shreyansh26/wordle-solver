Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback to base my decision on, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel coverage. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (especially E, A, O) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

I'll try a word that includes several of these common letters while avoiding double letters (since that would reduce the information gained). ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants. However, ""SLATE"" is also excellent, covering S, L, A, T, E. Both are strong starting words, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes the very common T.

We’ve learned:
- T is in the correct spot (position 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- S, L, and A are not in the word at all.

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 5.
Letters we know must appear: E (somewhere in positions 1-4).
Letters we know must NOT appear: S, L, A.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps T in position 4.
2. Moves E to a new position (positions 1, 2, or 3).
3. Introduces several new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “RENT” for the first four letters and then we need a fifth letter. But we need a full 5-letter word, and we can’t use S, L, or A. “ENTER” would put E in positions 1 and 5, but we know E isn’t in position 5. “TREED” isn’t great because “D” is less common. 

A better choice is “BERTH” – it keeps T in position 4, moves E to position 2, and introduces B, R, H. 

Let me double-check:
- Position 4 is T (✓).
- E is in position 2 (new spot, could be correct or wrong position).
- B, R, H are all new letters.

""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants. However, ""SLATE"" is also excellent, covering S, L, A, T, E.

From the three guesses we now know:

- T is fixed in position 4.
- E is fixed in position 2.
- H is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (it was in position 5 in both BERTH and DEPTH and was marked “-” each time, so it must be in position 1).
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, B, R, D, P.

Current pattern: H E _ T _  
(only positions 3 and 5 remain to be filled).

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more consonants (or a consonant and a vowel) that fit a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate endings:
– HE?T?

Looking at common patterns:
- HEY?T? – doesn’t fit.
- HENT? – “HENT” isn’t a word.
- HEM? – too short.
- HEFT? – but position 5 still open.
- HEFTY – but Y at the end is possible.
- HEFTS – S is eliminated.
- HEMIC – but C is allowed.
- HEFTY seems the most natural: H E F T Y.

Check letters used: H, E, F, T, Y – none are eliminated yet.

So the next logical guess is HEFTY.
