For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words with vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, T, N, S, L) are ideal. 

A classic strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This covers a wide range of frequent letters and provides good initial feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S – x → not in the word
- L – x → not in the word
- A – - → in the word but not in the 3rd position
- T – x → not in the word
- E – x → not in the word

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.
- It DOES contain an A somewhere except the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A in a different position (since it can’t be 3rd).
2. Brings in other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

A good choice is “RAINY” because:
- R, I, N, Y are all high-frequency letters we haven’t tried.
- Puts A in the 2nd position (safe since 3rd is excluded).
- Gives us five fresh letters to test.

Therefore, the next guess is RAINY.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, I, N.
2. Letters we know ARE in the word: A (in position 2), Y.
3. Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So the pattern so far is:
- _ A _ _ _
- Y must appear somewhere (positions 3, 4, or 5 are still open).
- R must appear somewhere but not in position 1 (positions 3, 4, 5 are open).

We still want to test common consonants we haven’t used (C, G, H, K, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (O, U) to narrow things down. A good next word would:
- Keep A in position 2 (confirmed ✓).
- Place Y in a new spot (let’s try position 5).
- Place R in a new spot (let’s try position 3).
- Introduce two new high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet: C and O.

The word that fits this is C A R O Y, but that is not a valid English word. Rearranging to keep positions 2 and 5 fixed and R in 3 gives us C A R Y O – also invalid. Let’s try R in position 4 instead: C A _ R Y. The word CARRY fits this pattern, but we’ve already ruled out R in position 1 (no conflict here), and C, A, R, Y are all allowed with the new letter R in position 4.

However, CARRY repeats R, which is allowed but might not be optimal. A better choice is C A R O Y – invalid. Let me think again: C A R P Y – invalid. Next best is C A R V Y – invalid. 

Another approach: try H A R D Y. H and D are new, A is fixed in position 2, R is in position 3 (allowed), Y in position 5. HARDY is valid.

HARDY:
- H (new)
- A (✓, position 2)
- R (in word, not position 1, placed at 3 – allowed)
- D (new)
- Y (✓, placed at 5)

This introduces two new letters (H, D) while keeping known letters and positions.
