For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

One popular strategy is to use words like ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""SLATE."" These words contain several common vowels and consonants. Among these, ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 very common letters. This seems like a strong starting point to gather information about the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE,"" which has S, L, A, T, E. ""RAISE"" seems slightly better because I and R are very common, and I covers the third most common vowel after A and E.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it provides good coverage of common letters.

Current facts:
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: R A I S E C U N T B M
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _
- From Guess 3 (BLOOM): L, O, and O are all in the word but in wrong positions.  
  – Since the second letter is already fixed as O, the other two O’s must appear elsewhere.
  – L is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore the secret word contains:
- O in position 2
- at least one more O somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- L somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- only unused letters (remaining common ones: D F G H J K P V W X Y Z, plus maybe Y as a vowel)

Possible forms with two O’s and one L:
O must appear at least twice and L once, so likely patterns:
O O _ _ _ (but first letter can’t be O because then second O is already correct, and we’d still need another O elsewhere) – doesn’t fit clues.
_ O O _ _
_ O _ O _
_ O _ _ O

And L can go in any open slot.

Fresh letters still available: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that slots L into one of the remaining positions and adds two more fresh consonants while preserving the double-O.

Candidate words:
- POOLS – P, S, L – but S is out.
- FLOOR – F, L, R – R is out.
- GLOOM – G, L, M – M is out.
- DROOL – D, R, L – R is out.
- HOOKY – H, K, Y – letters fresh, and double O with L not used, so skip.
- JOLLY – J, Y, L – only two O’s needed, but this has only one O.
- POLYP – P, L, Y, P – only one O.

A word that fits exactly: WOOLY
- W, L, Y are fresh letters.
- Positions: _ O O _ _ with L in 3rd and Y in 5th, second O in 4th is okay because feedback was O in wrong position (which is satisfied, since in BLOOM the last O was in 4th/5th and now in 4th).

Therefore WOOLY is valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

One popular strategy is to use words like ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""SLATE."" These words contain several common vowels and consonants. Among these, ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 very common letters. This seems like a strong starting point to gather information about the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE,"" which has S, L, A, T, E. ""RAISE"" seems slightly better because I and R are very common, and I covers the third most common vowel after A and E.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it provides good coverage of common letters.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, G  
Good vowels still available: O, U, Y

Because all five letters were rejected, I want a completely fresh set of common letters.  
A strong second-guess pattern is to pick two new vowels plus three new consonants.  
Top unused letters: O, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P.

I’ll combine O, U with T, N, L → “UNLTO” isn’t a word.  
“COUNT” uses C, O, U, N, T – all new and common.  
“MOUNT” is similar but uses M instead of C; C is slightly more frequent, so I’ll go with “COUNT.”

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T are all absent.
- Only O is confirmed, and it sits in the second position.

So the secret word has the form _O___ using letters not yet tried.  
High-frequency letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels Y (sometimes) and possibly another O (but we only have one confirmed).

We still need to test as many new common letters as possible, so I’ll pick B, L, M, D, etc.  
5-letter words with O in position 2 that use fresh letters:
- BLOWN (B, L, W, N — N is already out) → invalid
- BLOOM (B, L, M) → two O’s, but second O is fixed and first O is new; but L and M are fresh.
- DOGMA (D, G, M) → all fresh letters
- FROGS (F, R, G, S — R and S out)
- HOLLY (H, L, Y — L and Y fresh)
- JOKER (J, K, R — R out)
- LODGE (L, D, G) → all fresh
- MOGUL (M, G, L, U — U already out)
- POKER (P, K, R — R out)
- WORLD (W, R, L, D — R out)

Among the valid ones (all letters unused), “DOGMA” and “LODGE” and “BLOOM” seem best because they give three or four new consonants.
LODGE uses L, D, G, E — E is already out, so only L D G are new.
DOGMA uses D, G, M, A — A is out, so only D G M.
BLOOM uses B, L, M and an extra O — B, L, M are all fresh.

Let’s pick BLOOM as it tests three new common consonants and one extra vowel.

Let's extract the new information from the latest feedback.

Guess 4: WOOLY  
Feedback: W(x) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

Breakdown:
- Position 1 (W) – NOT in the word.
- Position 2 (O) – CORRECT position (already known).
- Position 3 (O) – IN the word but WRONG position.
- Position 4 (L) – CORRECT position.
- Position 5 (Y) – CORRECT position.

So the pattern is now:

_ O _ L Y

with an extra O somewhere in the remaining three open positions (positions 1, 3, 5).  
But position 5 is already Y, so the extra O must be in 1 or 3.

Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T, B, M, W.  
Remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z.  
Remaining vowel: only O (since U is out, A is out, I is out, E is out).

Thus the word must be one of:
- O O L Y – but it's 4 letters, so invalid.
- _ O O L Y – i.e., a consonant in position 1 and O in position 3.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ O O L Y:
- DOOLY – but ""DOOLY"" is not a valid English word.
- FOOLY – not a valid word.
- HOOly – not valid.
- POOLY – not valid.
- GOOLY – not valid.

Next possible form: _ O _ L Y with O in position 3.

So word structure: C O O L Y – where C is a consonant not yet used.

Valid word: DOOLY – but again ""DOOLY"" isn't valid.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ O O L Y is ""FOOLY"" but it's not recognized.  
Thus we might need to consider the other placement: O in position 1, but then the word would be O _ _ L Y, and O is at position 1. Then we'd need another O elsewhere, but positions 3 and 5 are taken by L and Y. So this seems impossible.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:

Pattern: _ O _ L Y  
We have one extra O that must go in position 1 or 3.  
Position 3 is already O in this pattern, so the only place left is position 1.

So the word must be O O _ L Y – but this is 5 letters with positions 1 and 2 both O.

Valid English word: ""OOL"" isn't a suffix, but ""OO"" is a prefix.  
Looking up, the only valid 5-letter word with structure OO_LY is ""OOL"" + something, but none exist.

Re-evaluate: Maybe the third O is in position 4, but position 4 is L. So no.

Thus the only possible structure is _ O O L Y with a consonant in position 1.

The consonants left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- DOOLY – not valid
- FOOLY – not valid
- GOOLY – slang for ""go on"", but not in standard dictionaries
- HOOLY – archaic, not standard
- POOLY – not valid
- KOOLY – not valid
- VOOLY – not valid
- XOOLY – not valid
- ZOOLY – not valid

Hmm, seems like none are valid. Did I miss a word?

Wait, ""DOOLY"" might be a misspelling or obscure. The closest valid word is ""DOOLY"" but it's not standard.

Alternative approach: Maybe the word has only two O's (positions 2 and 3), and the rest consonants. But position 4 is L, 5 is Y, and position 1 must be a consonant.

Thus the word must be C O O L Y where C is an unused consonant.

Valid word: ""DOOLY"" is not a standard English word. The only related word is ""COOLY"" (variant spelling of ""coolie""), but C is already ruled out.

Next possible consonant: F.

""FOOLY"" is not a word.

Next: G. ""GOOLY"" – not standard.

H: ""HOOLY"" – archaic.

P: ""POOLY"" – not valid.

K: ""KOOLY"" – not valid.

V: ""VOOLY"" – not valid.

Z: ""ZOOLY"" – not valid.

X: ""XOOLY"" – not valid.

J: ""JOOLY"" – not valid.

This suggests that the only possible valid word is ""DOOLY"", but it's not in standard dictionaries. However, in Wordle-like games, sometimes ""DOOLY"" is accepted as a variant or regional term.

But to be safe, let's check another structure: perhaps the extra O is in position 1, making the word O _ _ L Y, but then positions 3 would need O, but position 3 is open. So word would be O _ O L Y.

Valid word: ""OLOGY"" – but length is 5 and letters are O, O, L, O, G, Y – but we need only two O's, so this has three O's, which exceeds.

""OVOLy"" – not valid.

""OPOLY"" – not valid.

Thus the only plausible candidate is ""DOOLY"" despite its rarity.

But ""DOOLY"" is recognized in some word lists (e.g., Collins Scrabble Words), so we'll use it.

Thus the guess is ""DOOLY"".
</think>

The feedback shows the word must be _ O _ L Y with an extra O in position 3 (since position 2 is already O and the extra O must go in 1 or 3, but position 1 can't be O as no valid word starts OO). The only valid 5-letter word fitting _ O O L Y with unused consonants is ""DOOLY"".

<guess>DOOLY</guess>",DOOLY,"Let's extract the new information from the latest feedback.

Guess 4: WOOLY  
Feedback: W(x) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

Breakdown:
- Position 1 (W) – NOT in the word.
- Position 2 (O) – CORRECT position (already known).
- Position 3 (O) – IN the word but WRONG position.
- Position 4 (L) – CORRECT position.
- Position 5 (Y) – CORRECT position.

So the pattern is now:

_ O _ L Y

with an extra O somewhere in the remaining three open positions (positions 1, 3, 5).  
But position 5 is already Y, so the extra O must be in 1 or 3.

Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T, B, M, W.  
Remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z.  
Remaining vowel: only O (since U is out, A is out, I is out, E is out).

Thus the word must be one of:
- O O L Y – but it's 4 letters, so invalid.
- _ O O L Y – i.e., a consonant in position 1 and O in position 3.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ O O L Y:
- DOOLY – but ""DOOLY"" is not a valid English word.
- FOOLY – not a valid word.
- HOOly – not valid.
- POOLY – not valid.
- GOOLY – not valid.

Next possible form: _ O _ L Y with O in position 3.

So word structure: C O O L Y – where C is a consonant not yet used.

Valid word: DOOLY – but again ""DOOLY"" isn't valid.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ O O L Y is ""FOOLY"" but it's not recognized.  
Thus we might need to consider the other placement: O in position 1, but then the word would be O _ _ L Y, and O is at position 1. Then we'd need another O elsewhere, but positions 3 and 5 are taken by L and Y. So this seems impossible.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:

Pattern: _ O _ L Y  
We have one extra O that must go in position 1 or 3.  
Position 3 is already O in this pattern, so the only place left is position 1.

So the word must be O O _ L Y – but this is 5 letters with positions 1 and 2 both O.

Valid English word: ""OOL"" isn't a suffix, but ""OO"" is a prefix.  
Looking up, the only valid 5-letter word with structure OO_LY is ""OOL"" + something, but none exist.

Re-evaluate: Maybe the third O is in position 4, but position 4 is L. So no.

Thus the only possible structure is _ O O L Y with a consonant in position 1.

The consonants left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- DOOLY – not valid
- FOOLY – not valid
- GOOLY – slang for ""go on"", but not in standard dictionaries
- HOOLY – archaic, not standard
- POOLY – not valid
- KOOLY – not valid
- VOOLY – not valid
- XOOLY – not valid
- ZOOLY – not valid

Hmm, seems like none are valid. Did I miss a word?

Wait, ""DOOLY"" might be a misspelling or obscure. The closest valid word is ""DOOLY"" but it's not standard.

Alternative approach: Maybe the word has only two O's (positions 2 and 3), and the rest consonants. But position 4 is L, 5 is Y, and position 1 must be a consonant.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,FOLLY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

One popular strategy is to use words like ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""SLATE."" These words contain several common vowels and consonants. Among these, ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 very common letters. This seems like a strong starting point to gather information about the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE,"" which has S, L, A, T, E. ""RAISE"" seems slightly better because I and R are very common, and I covers the third most common vowel after A and E.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it provides good coverage of common letters.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.  
Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, G  
Good vowels still available: O, U, Y

Because all five letters were rejected, I want a completely fresh set of common letters.  
A strong second-guess pattern is to pick two new vowels plus three new consonants.  
Top unused letters: O, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P.

I’ll combine O, U with T, N, L → “UNLTO” isn’t a word.  
“COUNT” uses C, O, U, N, T – all new and common.  
“MOUNT” is similar but uses M instead of C; C is slightly more frequent, so I’ll go with “COUNT.”

<guess>COUNT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T are all absent.
- Only O is confirmed, and it sits in the second position.

So the secret word has the form _O___ using letters not yet tried.  
High-frequency letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels Y (sometimes) and possibly another O (but we only have one confirmed).

We still need to test as many new common letters as possible, so I’ll pick B, L, M, D, etc.  
5-letter words with O in position 2 that use fresh letters:
- BLOWN (B, L, W, N — N is already out) → invalid
- BLOOM (B, L, M) → two O’s, but second O is fixed and first O is new; but L and M are fresh.
- DOGMA (D, G, M) → all fresh letters
- FROGS (F, R, G, S — R and S out)
- HOLLY (H, L, Y — L and Y fresh)
- JOKER (J, K, R — R out)
- LODGE (L, D, G) → all fresh
- MOGUL (M, G, L, U — U already out)
- POKER (P, K, R — R out)
- WORLD (W, R, L, D — R out)

Among the valid ones (all letters unused), “DOGMA” and “LODGE” and “BLOOM” seem best because they give three or four new consonants.
LODGE uses L, D, G, E — E is already out, so only L D G are new.
DOGMA uses D, G, M, A — A is out, so only D G M.
BLOOM uses B, L, M and an extra O — B, L, M are all fresh.

Let’s pick BLOOM as it tests three new common consonants and one extra vowel.

<guess>BLOOM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: BLOOM -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(-) O(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: R A I S E C U N T B M
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _
- From Guess 3 (BLOOM): L, O, and O are all in the word but in wrong positions.  
  – Since the second letter is already fixed as O, the other two O’s must appear elsewhere.
  – L is in the word but not in position 2.

Therefore the secret word contains:
- O in position 2
- at least one more O somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- L somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- only unused letters (remaining common ones: D F G H J K P V W X Y Z, plus maybe Y as a vowel)

Possible forms with two O’s and one L:
O must appear at least twice and L once, so likely patterns:
O O _ _ _ (but first letter can’t be O because then second O is already correct, and we’d still need another O elsewhere) – doesn’t fit clues.
_ O O _ _
_ O _ O _
_ O _ _ O

And L can go in any open slot.

Fresh letters still available: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that slots L into one of the remaining positions and adds two more fresh consonants while preserving the double-O.

Candidate words:
- POOLS – P, S, L – but S is out.
- FLOOR – F, L, R – R is out.
- GLOOM – G, L, M – M is out.
- DROOL – D, R, L – R is out.
- HOOKY – H, K, Y – letters fresh, and double O with L not used, so skip.
- JOLLY – J, Y, L – only two O’s needed, but this has only one O.
- POLYP – P, L, Y, P – only one O.

A word that fits exactly: WOOLY
- W, L, Y are fresh letters.
- Positions: _ O O _ _ with L in 3rd and Y in 5th, second O in 4th is okay because feedback was O in wrong position (which is satisfied, since in BLOOM the last O was in 4th/5th and now in 4th).

Therefore WOOLY is valid.

Let’s list all the fixed facts after the five guesses.

1. Letters known NOT in the word:  
   R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T, B, M, W, D

2. Positions that are locked:
   - Position 2: O  
   - Position 4: L  
   - Position 5: Y  

3. One additional O must appear somewhere else (positions 1 or 3) because:
   – Guess 3 (BLOOM) said an O was “in the word but in the wrong position”  
   – Guess 4 (WOOLY) and Guess 5 (DOOLY) still show an O in the wrong position even though O is already correctly placed in position 2, so there must be a second O elsewhere.

Therefore the word shape is either  
   O O _ L Y   (two O’s)  
or  
   _ O O L Y   (which we already tried with DOOLY and it failed).

The remaining unused letters are: F, G, H, J, K, P, V, X, Z.  
Looking for a real 5-letter word that is O O _ L Y with one of those consonants in position 3:

- GOOLY – only 5 letters, but not a standard dictionary word  
- FOOLY – not standard  
- HOOLY – archaic  
- JOOLY – not valid  
- KOOLY – not valid  
- POOLY – not valid  
- VOOLY – not valid  
- XOOLY – not valid  
- ZOOLY – not valid  

The only standard English word that fits is “GOOLY” (a rare plural spelling of “goolie”), which is accepted by some word lists (e.g., Collins Scrabble).  
It satisfies:  
– Starts with G (unused)  
– Shape O O _ L Y  
– All letters not yet ruled out.

Hence GOOLY is the only remaining candidate.
