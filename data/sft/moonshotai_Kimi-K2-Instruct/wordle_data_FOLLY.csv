For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A(x), T(x), E(x): A, T, and E are not present.

So we know:
- No S, A, T, or E.
- L is in the word (but not in position 2).

Goal for the second guess:
1. Keep the letter L but move it to a different position.
2. Choose other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U, and possibly Y) to cover as much new ground as possible.

A good blend of frequent remaining letters would be: L, R, I, N, O.

A common word using these letters is ""LINER"". It positions L in the first spot (not position 2), and includes the vowels I and O plus the common consonant R and N.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, I, N, R.  
2. Letter L is in the word, but it is NOT in position 1 or 2 (it appeared as “wrong-position” in both guesses).  
   - In SLATE (position 2) it was “-”.  
   - In LINER (position 1) it was “-”.  
   Therefore, L must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t appeared yet. Among the remaining frequent letters we have O, U, D, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc. To maximize information, pick a word that:
- Places L in a new position (3, 4, or 5).  
- Uses several other untested common letters.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, O, U, D are all fresh letters.  
- L is placed in position 3 (a new spot).  
This tests 4 new letters plus the confirmed letter L.

Let’s synthesize everything learned so far.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
S, A, T, E, I, N, R, C, U, D

Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it has been “wrong position” in each of those places).  
Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y plus the vowels O (now known ✗) and the only unchecked common vowel Y.

So far O appeared in CLOUD and came back “-” (wrong position).  
That leaves O as a possible letter but not in position 3.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Uses L in position 4 or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
- Incorporates as many fresh common letters as possible.

Candidate letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O (with O allowed anywhere except position 3), L (fixed to 4 or 5).

A good mix is G, H, O, L, M.  
The word “GHO L M” isn’t valid, but we can rearrange to a real word: GHO LM → GHO…LM → GHO…LM → “GHOUL” is 5 letters but has U (ruled out).  
Try a different set: F, O, G, L, Y → rearrange to a valid word: F, O, G, Y plus L in position 4 or 5.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FOLLY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- L(-): L is in the word, but not in position 2.
- A(x), T(x), E(x): A, T, and E are not present.

So we know:
- No S, A, T, or E.
- L is in the word (but not in position 2).

Goal for the second guess:
1. Keep the letter L but move it to a different position.
2. Choose other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U, and possibly Y) to cover as much new ground as possible.

A good blend of frequent remaining letters would be: L, R, I, N, O.

A common word using these letters is ""LINER"". It positions L in the first spot (not position 2), and includes the vowels I and O plus the common consonant R and N.

Let’s try LINER.

   - In SLATE (position 2) it was “-”.  
   - In LINER (position 1) it was “-”.  
   Therefore, L must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t appeared yet. Among the remaining frequent letters we have O, U, D, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc. To maximize information, pick a word that:
- Places L in a new position (3, 4, or 5).  
- Uses several other untested common letters.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, O, U, D are all fresh letters.  
- L is placed in position 3 (a new spot).  
This tests 4 new letters plus the confirmed letter L.

Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y plus the vowels O (now known ✗) and the only unchecked common vowel Y.

We now know the exact pattern: _ O L L Y

We also know the first letter is NOT:  
S, A, T, E, I, N, R, C, U, D, H, D (re-stated), and must still be a letter that forms a common 5-letter English word ending in OLLY.

Valid remaining first-letter choices that make real words: F, G, J, L, M, P, T, W, etc.

The only common word that fits and uses a letter not yet ruled out is FOLLY.

All other candidates (GOLLY, JOLLY, LOLLY, MOLLY, POLLY, TOLLY, WOLLY) either use letters already excluded or duplicate letters unnecessarily. F is still permissible.

So the sixth and final guess should be FOLLY.
