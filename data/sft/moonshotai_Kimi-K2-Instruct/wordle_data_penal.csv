For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good strategy is to pick a word with 2-3 vowels and some common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""IRATE"". These cover many common letters and can quickly reveal or eliminate possibilities.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 very common consonants: R, S
This gives good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

- We have no information yet about B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and E in new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and perhaps another vowel to gather more information.

A strong choice is “ALERT”:
- A is in position 2 (different from 1).
- E is in position 4 (different from 5).
- Adds L and T, two very common consonants.
- Adds no forbidden letters (R, O, S) and re-uses confirmed letters A and E.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses:

Known letters (must appear):
- E (but not in positions 2, 4, or 5) → only possible in position 1 or 3
- A (now known to be in position 4)
- L (now known to be in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, I, D

So far we have: _ _ _ A L

Possible positions for E: position 1 or 3

We need to find two more consonants from remaining unused letters. Available consonants (not yet used or ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some good common consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P

Let's consider possible words:

If E is in position 1: E _ _ A L - but we need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Possible words: E C H A L, E B A L... but these don't seem like valid 5-letter words.

If E is in position 3: _ _ E A L - this seems more promising. We need letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining consonants.

Let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in E A L:
- B E A L → but we can't have B E A L (only 4 letters)
- C H E A L? No...
- Actually let's think of words that end with A L and have E somewhere:
  - C E R A L → but R is excluded
  - F E A L → too short
  - M E A L → this fits! M E A L is 4 letters, but we need 5
  - Wait, let's think systematically:

We need _ _ _ A L with E in position 1 or 3, and two other letters from available consonants.

If E is in position 3: C H E A L → CHEAL - not a word
F E A L → FEAL - too short
G E A L → GEAL - too short
H E A L → HEAL - too short
B E A L → BEAL - too short
Actually, let me think differently - we need 5 letters total, with known A4 L5, and E must appear.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- _ E _ A L
- _ _ E A L
- E _ _ A L

Looking at _ _ E A L:
- C H E A L → CHEAL - not valid
- B E E A L → not valid
- C A E A L → not valid

Wait, let me reconsider - we have confirmed letters at positions 4 and 5 are A and L respectively, and we know E must appear. Let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in A L with E somewhere:

Possible candidates:
- B E G A L → BEGAL - not a word
- C E B A L → CEBAL - not a word
- C H E A L → CHEAL - not a word
- F E M A L → FEMAL - not a word
- H E A L → too short
- M E A L → too short
- C A M E L → but that's C A M E L - let's check positions: if we have _ _ _ A L, then C A M E L would be C A M E L, but we need A in position 4.

Let me approach this differently - we know positions 4 and 5 are A and L. We need to fill positions 1, 2, 3 with letters not yet used, and include E somewhere.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ E A L
- _ E _ A L  
- E _ _ A L

Let's think of actual 5-letter words ending in A L:
- P E A L → PEAL - too short
- C E A L → CEAL - not a word
- G E A L → GEAL - not a word
- M E A L → MEAL - too short
- H E A L → HEAL - too short
- B E A L → BEAL - not a word
- C H E A L → CHEAL - not a word
- F E A L → FEAL - not a word
- P E A L → PEAL - not 5 letters

Wait, let's think of words like:
- C E B A L → CEBAL - no
- H E C A L → HECAL - no
- M E D A L → MEDAL - this is a valid word! M E D A L

Let's check MEDAL against our constraints:
- M: not used before
- E: needed and can be in position 2 (not ruled out)
- D: was used before and ruled out, so MEDAL won't work

Let me try another approach - what's left for consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ _ A L, including E, and using only allowed letters.

Possible valid words:
- B E G A L → BEGAL - no
- C H E A L → CHEAL - no
- C A M E L → but A is in position 4, not 2
- F E M A L → FEMAL - no
- G E M A L → GEMAL - no
- H E C A L → HECAL - no
- M E C A L → MECAL - no
- N E B A L → NEBAL - no
- P E N A L → PENAL - this is a valid word! P E N A L
Let's check PENAL:
- P: not used
- E: needed, can be in position 2
- N: not used
- A: position 4 ✓
- L: position 5 ✓
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, T, I, D)

PENAL fits all constraints.

Another option: H E C A L → no
C H E A L → no
B E C A L → BECAL - no

PENAL seems like the best valid option.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 4
- L is confirmed in position 5
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in positions 2, 4, or 5 from earlier clues, but position 2 is actually still possible - need to re-evaluate)

Actually, let me correct: E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

Looking for valid 5-letter words with:
- A in position 4
- L in position 5
- E in position 1 or 3
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, T, I, D)

Valid word: **PENAL** (P-E-N-A-L) - fits all requirements:
- E is in position 2 (but we thought E couldn't be in position 2 - wait, let me recheck)

Rechecking feedback:
- Guess 2: ALERT -> E(-) means E is not in position 4
- Guess 1: AROSE -> E(-) means E is not in position 5
- So E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3

Therefore PENAL is valid with E in position 2.
