For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to start with a word that has frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: common vowel

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the target word looks like: _ _ A _ _ with no C, R, N, or E.

We need:
1. A five-letter word with A in the 3rd position.
2. Avoid C, R, N, E entirely.
3. Include common consonants we haven’t tested yet (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) to maximize information gained.

A strong candidate is “PLANT” but N is already excluded, so that’s out. Next, “CLASH” has C and S, but C is excluded. “SLANT” has N and E. 

Let’s try “PLASM”:
- P, L, S, M are all new letters not tested before.
- A is correctly positioned.
- No C, R, N, E.

Alternative: “GLASS” – but S is repeated, which is less optimal. “PLASM” seems better.

Another option: “PLAID” – but D and I are new. However, “PLASM” tests S and M which are very common.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,shawl,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to start with a word that has frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: common vowel

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all.

So the target word looks like: _ _ A _ _ with no C, R, N, or E.

We need:
1. A five-letter word with A in the 3rd position.
2. Avoid C, R, N, E entirely.
3. Include common consonants we haven’t tested yet (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) to maximize information gained.

A strong candidate is “PLANT” but N is already excluded, so that’s out. Next, “CLASH” has C and S, but C is excluded. “SLANT” has N and E. 

Let’s try “PLASM”:
- P, L, S, M are all new letters not tested before.
- A is correctly positioned.
- No C, R, N, E.

Alternative: “GLASS” – but S is repeated, which is less optimal. “PLASM” seems better.

Another option: “PLAID” – but D and I are new. However, “PLASM” tests S and M which are very common.

Going with “PLASM”.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Uses both L and S exactly once each, and not in the positions they were in last guess (L was 2nd, S was 4th).
3. Does not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, P, M.

We can try placing L in positions 1, 3 (invalid, A is there), 4, or 5.
We can try placing S in positions 1, 2, 3 (invalid), or 5.

Let’s list possibilities:
- L in 1st, S in 2nd: L S A _ _ → LSAB_? Need valid word. LSAT_? LSATE – has E (invalid). LSATS – not valid. Not promising.
- L in 1st, S in 4th: L _ A S _ → L_ A S _. L B A S ? – LBAS_? Not valid.
- L in 1st, S in 5th: L _ A _ S → L _ A _ S. L D A D S – not valid. L B A C S – C excluded. L T A K S – T, K, S ok. ""LTAKS"" – not a valid word.

      - A (3rd) – correct, ok.
      - L (4th) – was 2nd before, ok.

S H A L L – but this has L in 4th and 5th which violates constraints since L was in 4th before.

Wait, re-examining constraints:
From feedback:
- S is correctly placed 1st
- A is correctly placed 3rd
- L is in word but not in 4th (from STALK feedback)
Thus L must be in 2nd or 5th position.

So possible patterns:
S L A _ _  or  S _ A _ L

Let’s explore both:

1. S L A _ _ :
Need two consonants for positions 4 and 5, excluding C, R, N, E, P, M, T, K
Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- S L A B S – S already used
- S L A B Y – Y new
   - S L A B Y:
      - S (1st) ✓
      - L (2nd) – new position
      - A (3rd) ✓
      - B (4th) – new
      - Y (5th) – new
   - Valid word and fits constraints.

2. S _ A _ L :
Explored earlier, no common words found.

Thus best guess: S L A B Y

Verify:
- Contains L now in 2nd (was 4th before) – ok
- Contains S and A correctly positioned
- No excluded letters
- Valid word
