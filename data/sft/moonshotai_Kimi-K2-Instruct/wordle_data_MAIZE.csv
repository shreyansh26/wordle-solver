1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
3. Uses different letters to test more possibilities

Common starting words often use vowels and frequent consonants. Some good options include:
- SLATE (uses S,L,A,T,E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- AUDIO (lots of vowels)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with STARE as it uses very common letters (S,T,A,R,E) which appear frequently in English words and gives good coverage of possible letters.

From the feedback:
- S, T, R are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word ends with E (position 5), contains the letter A somewhere in positions 1-4, and contains none of S, T, or R.

1. Keep E in the final position
2. Include A in a different position (not 3)

2. The letter A is in the word and in the **correct position** in PANEL (position 2). Therefore, the second letter is A and A is NOT elsewhere in the word.
3. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: S, T, R, P, N, L.
4. Letters we still have no information about: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern _ A _ _ E  
- Uses none of S, T, R, P, N, L  
- Introduces new, common letters to maximize information.

Common consonants not yet tested: C, D, G, H, K, B, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CABLE – but L is ruled out.
- CADGE – uses C, D, G.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
3. Uses different letters to test more possibilities

Common starting words often use vowels and frequent consonants. Some good options include:
- SLATE (uses S,L,A,T,E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- AUDIO (lots of vowels)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with STARE as it uses very common letters (S,T,A,R,E) which appear frequently in English words and gives good coverage of possible letters.

So the secret word ends with E (position 5), contains the letter A somewhere in positions 1-4, and contains none of S, T, or R.

Good next words should:
1. Keep E in the final position
2. Include A in a different position (not 3)
3. Avoid S, T, R entirely
4. Use new letters to gather more information

Possible candidates:
- CABLE (but B and L haven't been tested much)
- VALUE (V, L, U are new)
- PLATE (P, L are new, but T is excluded)
- FRAME (R is excluded)
- PANEL (P, N, L are new)

- VACUE – not a word.
- WACKE – obscure.

One solid common word that fits: CACHE (C, A, C, H, E). It checks all constraints:
- Position 2 is A.
- Ends in E.
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s go with CACHE.

(Note: If CACHE were invalid for some reason, I’d switch to CADGE next.)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list everything we now know:

1. Position 2 is A (from PANEL and CACHE both giving A✓ in slot 2).
2. Position 5 is E (from STARE, PANEL, CACHE all giving E✓ in slot 5).
3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   S, T, R, P, N, L, C, H
4. So far the pattern is: _ A _ _ E

We still need to place three more letters, none of which are any of the excluded ones.

Available (unused) letters that are common and worth testing:
- B, D, F, G, I, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a real word that fits the form _ A _ _ E with only these letters.

Possible easy words:
- BAGDE → needs 5 letters, “BADGE”
- GABLE → but L is excluded
- FABLE → L excluded
- MAIZE → Z is uncommon, check if it’s valid
- WAFER → R excluded
- MARGE → R excluded
- GAMER → R excluded
- WAGED → fits: W, A, G, E, D → WAGED (but E is fixed at 5)
- BADGE → fits: B, A, D, G, E

BADGE uses B, A, D, G, E:
- Position 2 A ✓
- Position 5 E ✓
- Doesn’t use any forbidden letters.

Let’s go with BADGE.

1. Word must be _ A _ _ E (positions 2 and 5 fixed).
2. Letters **excluded** so far: S, T, R, P, N, L, C, H, B, D, G.
3. Remaining common consonants: F, K, M, V, W, Y  
   Remaining vowels (besides A and E): I, O, U

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form _ A _ _ E using only letters not yet ruled out.

Look for common words:
- FABLE → L excluded  
- FRAME → R excluded  
- WAFER → R excluded  
- WAGED → D excluded  
- VAPED → P excluded  
- KAYAK → K, A, Y, A, K; A is fixed only at position 2, so not valid (A cannot appear elsewhere)  
- KNAVE → N excluded  
- MARGE → R, G excluded  
- WAIVE → W, A, I, V, E — fits pattern _ A _ _ E and uses only allowed letters.

Check WAIVE:
- W (new, allowed)  
- A (position 2)  
- I (new, allowed)  
- V (new, allowed)  
- E (position 5)  
All constraints satisfied.

From the latest feedback we now have three exact letters fixed:

Position 2: A(✓) → A  
Position 3: I(✓) → I  
Position 4: V(x) → not V  
Position 5: E(✓) → E  

So the pattern is: _ A I _ E

Letters already excluded:  
S, T, R, P, N, L, C, H, B, D, G, W, V

Common remaining consonants to test in positions 1 and 4: F, K, M, Y  
Vowels already used: A, I, E (none others allowed).

Possible words that fit:

1. FAIRE – but R is excluded  
2. MAIZE – Z and extra A disallowed  
3. KNAVE – N excluded  
4. MAILE – L excluded  
5. MAIZE – already ruled out  
6. FAINE – N excluded  
7. KAINE – N excluded  
8. YARKE – R excluded  
9. MAJID – needs to end in E  
10. KAINE – N excluded  

Real candidate: **MAIZE** – but Z is uncommon and has A twice → invalid.  

Next clear candidate: **FAIRE** – but R excluded.  

Check **MAIZE** again: _A I_ _E pattern → invalid A in position 4.  

Actually, let’s list remaining legal letters:  
Allowed consonants for positions 1 and 4: F, K, M, Y  
Allowed vowels: none extra.

Real word that fits: **MAIZE** – but has Z which we haven’t tested, but it is a real word. However, it is against rules because it has A twice.  

Next real word: **FAKIE** – F, A, K, I, E → fits _ A I _ E pattern, uses only allowed letters.  

**FAKIE** is a valid 5-letter word (skateboard term), and uses F and K which are still untested.
