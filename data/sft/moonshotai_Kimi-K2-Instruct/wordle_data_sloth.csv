For the first guess in Wordle, it's wise to choose a word that contains common letters (vowels and consonants) to maximize information gained. The best starting words typically have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters
- Good distribution across the alphabet

Popular choices include words like ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU"", ""ROATE"", or ""SLATE"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is excellent because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (most common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

The feedback from RAISE tells us:
- R, A, I, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, E
- DOES contain S, but it is NOT in position 4

Since we know S must appear somewhere else, we want a new guess that:
1. Includes S in a different position
2. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet

Common letters we haven’t tested include: T, O, N, L, U, Y, D, H, C, M, P, B, G, F, W, K, V, Z, J, Q, X.

A good second guess is often a word that uses new common consonants and vowels like O, T, N, L, U. “SOUND” fits well:
- S is moved to position 1
- O and U are common untested vowels
- N and D are common untested consonants

From the two guesses:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - Eliminates R, A, I, E entirely.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   - S is now locked in position 1.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - U, N, D are eliminated.

So the secret word must:
- Start with S (position 1).  
- Contain O somewhere after position 1.  
- Contain S only once (since we haven’t seen duplicates).  
- Use letters not yet eliminated: we’ve ruled out R,A,I,E,U,N,D.  
  Still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels (only O for now).

We also know the remaining three positions (2-5) must hold O plus two more distinct letters chosen from the allowed set.

A good strategy is to test a fresh set of common consonants (T, L, H, M, K) while placing O in a new spot and keeping S fixed at the start.

A balanced candidate is “STOCK”:
- S fixed at position 1.  
- O placed at position 3 (new location).  
- Tests T, C, K which are common and untested.  
- Uses no eliminated letters.

Current constraints:

Known letters and positions:
- S is confirmed at position 1.
- O is confirmed at position 3.

Known exclusions:
Letters totally eliminated so far: R, A, I, E, U, N, D, C, K.
Positions eliminated:
- O cannot be at position 2 (from SOUND) or 4 (from STOCK).
- T is in the word but NOT at position 2 (from STOCK).

So the pattern is:
S _ O _ _
with T somewhere in positions 4 or 5, and positions 2 and 5 (or 4 if T is at 5) to be filled with remaining available letters.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven't ruled out yet. From earlier, vowels ruled out: A, I, E, U. Only O is confirmed, so remaining vowels to consider: none. The only vowel we have is O, already placed. So positions 2, 4, 5 must be filled with consonants.

We still need to place T in positions 4 or 5.

Let's try placing T at position 4:
S _ O T _
Now position 2 and 5 need consonants from available set. We want common letters to maximize info.

Common available consonants: L, M, P, B, G, H.

Let's pick two that make a valid word: S _ O T _

Looking at possible common combinations:
S H O T _ – but we need a fifth letter, valid words: SHOT is 4 letters, need 5.
Hmm, maybe S P O T _ – but that uses P, O, T already, need a fifth letter after T. Doesn't form a common 5-letter word.
S L O T _ – SLOT plus a letter: S L O T H → SLOTH is a valid word.

SLOTH:
- S at 1 (correct)
- L at 2 (new letter, not eliminated)
- O at 3 (correct)
- T at 4 (T is in the word, and position 2 is already excluded for T)
- H at 5 (new letter, not eliminated)

This seems like a strong candidate to test L and H while placing T correctly.

Alternative placing T at position 5:
S _ O _ T
Then position 2 and 4 need letters. Example: S P O R T – but R is eliminated.
S M O L T – but L is not yet placed, but SMOLT is valid.
S M O L T:
- S, O correct positions
- M, L, T are new placements
But we have T at 5, which hasn't been excluded for T.

Between SLOTH and SMOLT, SLOTH tests L and H, while SMOLT tests M and L. SLOTH uses slightly more common letters.

I'll go with SLOTH.
