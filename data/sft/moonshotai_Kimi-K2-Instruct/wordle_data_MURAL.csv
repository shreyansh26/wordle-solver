For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Uses a mix of vowels and consonants

Some good starting words that meet these criteria include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, AUDIO. Among these, STARE is particularly strong because:
- S is very common in English words
- T is the second most common letter
- A, R, E are all very common vowels/consonants
- The word contains no duplicate letters

This should give us good information about the presence of 5 frequently occurring letters.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (marked x)  
- A and R ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (marked -)

So the target word:
- Contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, T, E anywhere

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and R (since they’re confirmed)  
2. Avoids S, T, E entirely  
3. Tests three new consonants/vowels to narrow the field quickly  
4. Places A and R in new positions

A good candidate is “ACORN”:

- Adds three new letters C, O, N (none of which are S, T, E)  
- Moves A to position 1 and R to position 4 (different from STARE)  
- Contains no duplicates

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Uses a mix of vowels and consonants

Some good starting words that meet these criteria include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, AUDIO. Among these, STARE is particularly strong because:
- S is very common in English words
- T is the second most common letter
- A, R, E are all very common vowels/consonants
- The word contains no duplicate letters

This should give us good information about the presence of 5 frequently occurring letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, E are NOT in the word (marked x)  
- A and R ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (marked -)

So the target word:
- Contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, T, E anywhere

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps A and R (since they’re confirmed)  
2. Avoids S, T, E entirely  
3. Tests three new consonants/vowels to narrow the field quickly  
4. Places A and R in new positions

A good candidate is “ACORN”:
- Uses A and R (confirmed letters)  
- Adds three new letters C, O, N (none of which are S, T, E)  
- Moves A to position 1 and R to position 4 (different from STARE)  
- Contains no duplicates

Let me test ACORN.

- R is still in the word but not in position 4 (it was also not in position 3 from STARE).
- C, O, N are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So, the target word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does NOT contain S, T, E, C, O, N.
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- R is not in positions 3 or 4.

Remaining possible positions for A: 3, 4, or 5.
Remaining possible positions for R: 1, 2, or 5.

We have not yet tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and R in new positions (positions 3 and 1, respectively).
2. Tests three new common letters not yet ruled out.
3. Avoids all letters already ruled out (S, T, E, C, O, N).

A good candidate is ""DRAFT"":
- Uses R in position 1 (new position).
- Uses A in position 3 (new position).
- Tests D, F (both new and common consonants).
- T is ruled out, so this won't work. My mistake.

Let me rethink. I need to avoid S, T, E, C, O, N. The word must have A and R in new positions.

Good letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Attempting R in position 1 and A in position 3 again:
- R _ A _ _
- Need three more letters from remaining set, common ones: D, L, M, B, K, etc.

- Possible word: ""GRAIL"" - but L and I are new, G is new. Does not contain any ruled-out letters.
- G(x), R(-), A(-), I, L - but we don't know about G, I, L yet.

From the feedback on DURAL:

- D is NOT in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, ✓)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, ✓)
- A is in the correct position (position 4, ✓)
- L is in the correct position (position 5, ✓)

So the target word is now fully determined except for the first letter, with the pattern:
_ U R A L

Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, C, O, N, I, V, D
Letters already confirmed: U, R, A, L

Remaining possible letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word beginning with one of these letters and ending in ""URAL"".

Possible candidates:
- B, F, G, H, K, M, P - these are the most common starting consonants left.

Looking at common words:
- B - BURAL? Not a valid word
- F - FURAL? Not valid
- G - GURAL? Not valid
- H - HURAL? Not valid
- K - KURAL? Not valid
- M - MURAL - yes! MURAL is a valid word
- P - PURAL? Not valid

Thus, MURAL is the only valid remaining word fitting the pattern _ U R A L.
