For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are common consonants.
- A and E are common vowels.
- N is also a frequent letter.
This combination gives us good coverage and helps rule in or out several letters right away.

From Guess 1 (CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)) we learn:
- C and N are not in the secret word at all (✗).
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the word definitely contains R, A, E (each once) and does not contain C or N.

Letters we still need to test: common consonants like T, L, S, I, D, G, etc., plus the known R, A, E.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, A, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new, high-frequency letters (T, S, L, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid C and N entirely.

One strong 5-letter word that satisfies these criteria is ""STARE"":
- S, T are totally new high-frequency letters.
- R, A, E are repositioned (1st-2nd-3rd vs 2nd-3rd-5th in CRANE).
- No C or N.

- Positions ruled out for R: positions 2 (CRANE) and 4 (STARE).  
- Positions ruled out for E: positions 5 (CRANE) and 5 (STARE).

- A cannot be in position 3.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to find a 5-letter word that:

   - A is in position 3: but A was already ruled out for position 3 by both guesses! So this is invalid.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known letters that MUST be in the word:  
- A (confirmed by its ✓ in position 2 in EARLY).  
- R and E are also in the word, but their positions are still unknown.

Known letters that CANNOT be in the word:  
- C, N, S, T, L, Y.

Ruled-out positions so far:  

A) From CRANE:  
- R ≠ 2, A ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.  

B) From STARE:  
- R ≠ 4, A ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.  

C) From EARLY:  
- A is now locked at position 2.  
- R ≠ 3, E ≠ 1.  

So we have:  
- Position 2 = A (locked).  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4. Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5. Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.  

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) with exactly two of them already known (R and E) plus one new letter that is NOT in {C,N,S,T,L,Y}. Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, M, B, F, P, etc.

We can systematically build possible patterns:

Pattern form: _ A _ _ _

Constraints:
- One of positions 1/5 must be R.  
- One of positions 3/4 must be E.  

Case 1: R in position 1  
Then pattern is R A _ _ _  
E must now be in 3 or 4.  

Subcase 1a: R A E _ _  
We need one more consonant for positions 4 and 5 (but we have only one slot left, position 5, because position 4 is still empty). Wait, we only have 5 letters total so far: R,A,E and two new ones. Actually, we’ve placed three letters (R,A,E) so we need TWO more letters for positions 4 and 5. But R,A,E already occupy 3 letters, so we need two more distinct letters. However, the word is only 5 letters, so this subcase has R,A,E plus two more letters. That’s valid.

Subcase 1b: R A _ E _  
Same idea.

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then pattern is _ A _ _ R  
E must be in 3 or 4.

Subcase 2a: _ A E _ R  
Subcase 2b: _ A _ E R  

Let’s find a word that satisfies one of these patterns and only uses allowed letters.

Let’s scan common 5-letter words.

- F A R E D: but D is allowed, but positions don’t match any pattern above.  
- R A Z E D: Z is allowed, but pattern is R A Z E D, which is R A _ E _ - looks good. But is RAZED a valid English word? Yes, it is (past tense of raze).  
- H A R E M: pattern _ A _ E R, which is OK if R is at position 5. H A R E M would be H A R E M, but R is at 3, which is disallowed. So no.  
- M A R E D: positions M A R E D - R is at 3 (disallowed).  
- G A R D E: Not a word.  
- R A B E T: Not a word.  
- R A G E D: R A G E D - positions R(1), A(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). This fits pattern R A _ E _. All letters allowed (G,D not forbidden). And RAGED is a valid English word.

Thus RAGED is a valid candidate under subcase 1b: R A _ E _.

Let’s check constraints:
- R: position 1 (allowed).  
- A: position 2 (locked).  
- G: new letter, allowed (not in C,N,S,T,L,Y).  
- E: position 4 (allowed).  
- D: new letter, allowed.

This satisfies all constraints.

Another possible word is G R A V E, but A must be in position 2, so G R A V E has A in position 3 - invalid.

Thus, the best next guess is RAGED.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,waver,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are common consonants.
- A and E are common vowels.
- N is also a frequent letter.
This combination gives us good coverage and helps rule in or out several letters right away.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)) we learn:
- C and N are not in the secret word at all (✗).
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the word definitely contains R, A, E (each once) and does not contain C or N.

Letters we still need to test: common consonants like T, L, S, I, D, G, etc., plus the known R, A, E.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, A, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new, high-frequency letters (T, S, L, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid C and N entirely.

One strong 5-letter word that satisfies these criteria is ""STARE"":
- S, T are totally new high-frequency letters.
- R, A, E are repositioned (1st-2nd-3rd vs 2nd-3rd-5th in CRANE).
- No C or N.

This maximizes the chance of hits while still repositioning the known letters.

Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
   - C and N are not in the word at all.  
   - R, A, E are in the word but in the wrong positions.

2. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   - S and T are not in the word at all.  
   - A, R, E are still in the word but in the wrong positions compared to this guess as well.

So far:
- Known letters that must appear: A, R, E (each once).  
- Known letters that must NOT appear: C, N, S, T.  
- Positions ruled out for A: positions 3 (CRANE) and 3 (STARE).  
- Positions ruled out for R: positions 2 (CRANE) and 4 (STARE).  
- Positions ruled out for E: positions 5 (CRANE) and 5 (STARE).

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for A, R, E:

- A cannot be in position 3.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to find a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once each.  
- Does not contain C, N, S, T.  
- Places A, R, E only in allowed positions.

Good letters to try next: D, L, G, H, M, P, etc.

A word that fits is ""GLARE"":
- Contains G, L (new letters), plus A, R, E.
- Positions: G L A R E.  
   - A is in position 3: but A was already ruled out for position 3 by both guesses! So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""PEARL"":
- P, L are new.  
- Positions: P E A R L.  
   - E is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - A is in position 3 (disallowed), so invalid.

Try ""EARLY"":
- E A R L Y.  
   - A is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
   - E is in position 1 (allowed).  
   - No disallowed letters.  
   - All letters: E, A, R are in allowed positions.

This seems valid.

From Guess 4 (RAGED):

- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already locked).
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (locked).
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Now we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ A _ E _
2. The letters we must use: A (position 2), E (position 4), R (must appear somewhere since it's in the word), plus one more letter we haven't ruled out yet.
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, S, T, L, Y, G, D.

We need to place R in either position 3 or 5 (since positions 1,2,4 are taken/locked, and R was already ruled out for positions 2,4 in earlier feedback).

So possible patterns:
- _ A R E _
- _ A _ E R

We need to find a 5-letter word matching one of these patterns, using only allowed letters (not in the banned list: C,N,S,T,L,Y,G,D) and ensuring R appears once.

Allowed consonants remaining: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z, etc.

Possible words:
1. _ A R E _:
   - B A R E B (invalid, E already set)
   - B A R E D (D banned)
   - F A R E D (D banned)
   - K A R E M (K,A,R,E,M - valid letters, M not banned)

   - P A R E D (D banned)
   - V A R E B (invalid)
   - W A R E Z (invalid)
   - Z A R E B (invalid)
   - H A R E M (M allowed, valid word)

2. _ A _ E R:

   - W A V E R (V allowed, valid word)
   - Z A V E R (V allowed, valid word)

We need to pick one that's most likely. ""BAKER"" is a common word fitting _ A _ E R.

Let's verify:
- B (new), A (position 2), K (new), E (position 4), R (position 5).
- All letters allowed (none banned).
- R is in position 5, which wasn't ruled out before.
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

Thus, BAKER is a strong next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,waver,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are common consonants.
- A and E are common vowels.
- N is also a frequent letter.
This combination gives us good coverage and helps rule in or out several letters right away.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)) we learn:
- C and N are not in the secret word at all (✗).
- R, A, and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the word definitely contains R, A, E (each once) and does not contain C or N.

Letters we still need to test: common consonants like T, L, S, I, D, G, etc., plus the known R, A, E.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, A, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new, high-frequency letters (T, S, L, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid C and N entirely.

One strong 5-letter word that satisfies these criteria is ""STARE"":
- S, T are totally new high-frequency letters.
- R, A, E are repositioned (1st-2nd-3rd vs 2nd-3rd-5th in CRANE).
- No C or N.

This maximizes the chance of hits while still repositioning the known letters.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
   - C and N are not in the word at all.  
   - R, A, E are in the word but in the wrong positions.

2. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)  
   - S and T are not in the word at all.  
   - A, R, E are still in the word but in the wrong positions compared to this guess as well.

So far:
- Known letters that must appear: A, R, E (each once).  
- Known letters that must NOT appear: C, N, S, T.  
- Positions ruled out for A: positions 3 (CRANE) and 3 (STARE).  
- Positions ruled out for R: positions 2 (CRANE) and 4 (STARE).  
- Positions ruled out for E: positions 5 (CRANE) and 5 (STARE).

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for A, R, E:

- A cannot be in position 3.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.  
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to find a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once each.  
- Does not contain C, N, S, T.  
- Places A, R, E only in allowed positions.

Good letters to try next: D, L, G, H, M, P, etc.

A word that fits is ""GLARE"":
- Contains G, L (new letters), plus A, R, E.
- Positions: G L A R E.  
   - A is in position 3: but A was already ruled out for position 3 by both guesses! So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""PEARL"":
- P, L are new.  
- Positions: P E A R L.  
   - E is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - A is in position 3 (disallowed), so invalid.

Try ""EARLY"":
- E A R L Y.  
   - A is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
   - E is in position 1 (allowed).  
   - No disallowed letters.  
   - All letters: E, A, R are in allowed positions.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known letters that MUST be in the word:  
- A (confirmed by its ✓ in position 2 in EARLY).  
- R and E are also in the word, but their positions are still unknown.

Known letters that CANNOT be in the word:  
- C, N, S, T, L, Y.

Ruled-out positions so far:  

A) From CRANE:  
- R ≠ 2, A ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.  

B) From STARE:  
- R ≠ 4, A ≠ 3, E ≠ 5.  

C) From EARLY:  
- A is now locked at position 2.  
- R ≠ 3, E ≠ 1.  

So we have:  
- Position 2 = A (locked).  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4. Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5. Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.  

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) with exactly two of them already known (R and E) plus one new letter that is NOT in {C,N,S,T,L,Y}. Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, M, B, F, P, etc.

We can systematically build possible patterns:

Pattern form: _ A _ _ _

Constraints:
- One of positions 1/5 must be R.  
- One of positions 3/4 must be E.  

Case 1: R in position 1  
Then pattern is R A _ _ _  
E must now be in 3 or 4.  

Subcase 1a: R A E _ _  
We need one more consonant for positions 4 and 5 (but we have only one slot left, position 5, because position 4 is still empty). Wait, we only have 5 letters total so far: R,A,E and two new ones. Actually, we’ve placed three letters (R,A,E) so we need TWO more letters for positions 4 and 5. But R,A,E already occupy 3 letters, so we need two more distinct letters. However, the word is only 5 letters, so this subcase has R,A,E plus two more letters. That’s valid.

Subcase 1b: R A _ E _  
Same idea.

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then pattern is _ A _ _ R  
E must be in 3 or 4.

Subcase 2a: _ A E _ R  
Subcase 2b: _ A _ E R  

Let’s find a word that satisfies one of these patterns and only uses allowed letters.

Let’s scan common 5-letter words.

- F A R E D: but D is allowed, but positions don’t match any pattern above.  
- R A Z E D: Z is allowed, but pattern is R A Z E D, which is R A _ E _ - looks good. But is RAZED a valid English word? Yes, it is (past tense of raze).  
- H A R E M: pattern _ A _ E R, which is OK if R is at position 5. H A R E M would be H A R E M, but R is at 3, which is disallowed. So no.  
- M A R E D: positions M A R E D - R is at 3 (disallowed).  
- G A R D E: Not a word.  
- R A B E T: Not a word.  
- R A G E D: R A G E D - positions R(1), A(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). This fits pattern R A _ E _. All letters allowed (G,D not forbidden). And RAGED is a valid English word.

Thus RAGED is a valid candidate under subcase 1b: R A _ E _.

Let’s check constraints:
- R: position 1 (allowed).  
- A: position 2 (locked).  
- G: new letter, allowed (not in C,N,S,T,L,Y).  
- E: position 4 (allowed).  
- D: new letter, allowed.

This satisfies all constraints.

Another possible word is G R A V E, but A must be in position 2, so G R A V E has A in position 3 - invalid.

Thus, the best next guess is RAGED.

- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already locked).
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (locked).
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Now we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ A _ E _
2. The letters we must use: A (position 2), E (position 4), R (must appear somewhere since it's in the word), plus one more letter we haven't ruled out yet.
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, S, T, L, Y, G, D.

We need to place R in either position 3 or 5 (since positions 1,2,4 are taken/locked, and R was already ruled out for positions 2,4 in earlier feedback).

So possible patterns:
- _ A R E _
- _ A _ E R

We need to find a 5-letter word matching one of these patterns, using only allowed letters (not in the banned list: C,N,S,T,L,Y,G,D) and ensuring R appears once.

Allowed consonants remaining: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z, etc.

Possible words:
1. _ A R E _:
   - B A R E B (invalid, E already set)
   - B A R E D (D banned)

   - V A R E B (invalid)
   - W A R E Z (invalid)
   - Z A R E B (invalid)

2. _ A _ E R:

   - F A K E R (K allowed, valid word)
   - H A V E R (V allowed, valid word)
   - M A K E R (K allowed, valid word)
   - P A V E R (V allowed, valid word)
   - W A V E R (V allowed, valid word)
   - Z A V E R (V allowed, valid word)

We need to pick one that's most likely. ""BAKER"" is a common word fitting _ A _ E R.

Let's verify:
- B (new), A (position 2), K (new), E (position 4), R (position 5).

- No conflicts with previous feedback.

All feedback combined tells us:

- The word must contain A in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: C, N, S, T, L, Y, G, D, B, K.  
- So the pattern is _ A _ E R with only one unknown letter left in position 1 or 3.  
- Position 3 is already filled by E (position 4), so position 3 must be a new letter not yet used.  
- Therefore the pattern is _ A _ E R where the blanks must be filled with remaining allowed consonants.  
- Allowed consonants not yet tested: F, H, J, M, P, V, W, Z, etc.  

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ A _ E R with no banned letters:
- F A V E R – “FAVER” isn’t a word.  
- H A V E R – “HAVER” is valid but less common.  
- P A V E R – “PAVER” is valid.  
- M A V E R – “MAVER” isn’t a word.  
- W A V E R – “WAVER” is common and valid, and all letters are allowed (W, A, V, E, R).  

Thus “WAVER” is the most likely candidate.
