For the first guess, we want to maximize information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters and good vowel/consonant coverage. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present
- Common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No duplicate letters to maximize unique letter coverage

- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E
- We still need to test other common vowels/consonants, especially O, U, T, N, L, etc.

1. Keep the known A and move it to a new position
2. Introduce new common letters, especially other vowels and consonants
3. Avoid any letters we know are absent (R, I, S, E)

Let's synthesize everything we now know:

1. Letters we have ruled out (never appear): R, I, S, E, B, U, H  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - O (position 1)  
   - A (somewhere other than positions 1 or 2, yet not 3 either because oatch gave A(-) while A was at 3)  
   - T (position 3)  
   - C (somewhere other than position 4)  

So the four confirmed letters are: O _ T _ A (or O _ _ T A or O T _ A _ etc.), with A and T already pinned to specific spots only if we take the position feedback literally.

But the feedback for A in oatch was A(-), meaning A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
From earlier, A was also not in positions 1 or 2.  
Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, C(-) tells us C is in the word but not in position 4, so C must be in 2 or 5.

T(✓) tells us T is already in the correct spot at position 3.

We now know:

O _ T _ _   with A and C occupying positions 4 & 5 in some order, or position 2 & 5, etc.

But since A must be 4 or 5 and C must be 2 or 5, the only overlap is position 5.  
If A is at 4, then C must be at 2.  
If A is at 5, then C must be at 2.

Therefore two possibilities remain for the four known letters:

1. O C T A _  
2. O C T _ A  

We still need one more letter (unknown), which must be different from the already confirmed letters.  
The simplest next guess is to test the pattern O C T A _ with a common consonant for the last slot.  
A good candidate consonant that hasn’t appeared yet is N.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,octal,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters and good vowel/consonant coverage. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to quickly identify which vowels are present
- Common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No duplicate letters to maximize unique letter coverage

<guess>arise</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""arise"":
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x) → R, I, S, and E are not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A but not in position 1 (so A must be in positions 2-5)
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E
- We still need to test other common vowels/consonants, especially O, U, T, N, L, etc.

To maximize information from the second guess, we want to:
1. Keep the known A and move it to a new position
2. Introduce new common letters, especially other vowels and consonants
3. Avoid any letters we know are absent (R, I, S, E)

A good candidate is ""ABOUT"":
- Includes the known A in position 2 (not 1)
- Tests the common vowels O and U
- Tests common consonants B and T
- Avoids all letters we know are not in the word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. A(-) in both guesses ⇒ A is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 ⇒ A must be at 3, 4, or 5.
2. B(x), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x), U(x) ⇒ these letters are NOT in the word at all.
3. O(-) ⇒ O is in the word but not in position 3 ⇒ O must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. T(-) ⇒ T is in the word but not in position 5 ⇒ T must be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Known letters so far: A, O, T  
Known positions:  
A at 3,4,5  
O at 1,2,4,5  
T at 1,2,3,4  

No letter repeats (since we have no duplicate feedback).

Possible combinations:
- T must be in 1-4 and O in 1-2-4-5, A in 3-4-5
- If A is at 3, O can be 1,2,4,5 and T can be 1,2,4 (but not 5)
- If A is at 4, O can be 1,2,5 and T can be 1,2,3
- If A is at 5, O can be 1,2,4 and T can be 1,2,3,4

We need three more letters (since we already know A, O, T are present) chosen from unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, Y.

A good third guess should test new common consonants while placing the known letters in likely positions. Let's try a word that:
- Places A at 3 (common position)
- Places O at 1 (common start)
- Places T at 4 (common placement)
- Introduces new consonants: C and H

Word: OATCH
- O at 1, A at 3, T at 4
- C and H are new common letters

This fits all constraints.
