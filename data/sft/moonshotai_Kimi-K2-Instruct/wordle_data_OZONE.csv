For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify as many correct or misplaced letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (a common consonant)
This gives me a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word at all (marked x).
- N is in the word and in the correct last position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was at position 5; so it must be in positions 1–4).

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ N
- Contains the letters E and N (N is fixed at the end).
- Cannot contain C, R, A.

I want a word that:
- Ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1–4.
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out (like S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E.
- Ends with N.
- Contains E in position 2.
- Uses new letters S, T, O that haven’t been ruled out yet.

That seems optimal for narrowing down further.

Current knowledge:

1. Word ends in N (position 5 is N).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.
3. Letters present in the word: E, O, N (with N locked in position 5).
4. From STONE we see that:
   - O was not in the right spot (it was in position 3, but got “-” meaning it exists but is misplaced).
   - E was not in position 4 (it also got “-”), so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - N is correctly in position 5.
5. So our pattern now is: _ _ _ _ N
   - Must contain O somewhere in 1–4.
   - Must contain E somewhere in 1–3.
   - No S, T, C, R, A.

Good letters left to try: D, L, G, H, M, P, U, Y, I, etc.

I need a 5-letter word ending in N that has both O and E in the first four positions, and avoids forbidden letters. 

One candidate: “OPINE”
- O P I N E
- Ends in N, contains O and E, and uses new letters P, I which haven’t been tested yet.
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know it can’t be in 5, and we’re testing if it can be in 4).

Another candidate: “MELON” – but this has L in position 3, O in 4, E in 2, N in 5. But O was marked “-” when in position 3; putting it in position 4 is fine. However, we already have N locked in 5. The word “MELON” has E in 2, O in 4, N in 5. This fits constraints.

But let me check if MELON uses any forbidden letters: M, E, L, O, N – none of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,S,T) are used. This seems safe.

From the feedback on MELON:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (“-” feedback).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (“-” feedback).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (“-” feedback). This is impossible, because position 5 must be N according to CRANE (N✓). The only way N can be “in the word but wrong position” is if the word has another N somewhere else and N is duplicated. That’s unlikely, so the feedback on MELON must be parsed as:
  - The N in position 5 is correct (✓) from CRANE.
  - The feedback on MELON must be interpreted with N as ✓ (since CRANE already locked N at position 5).
  - So the feedback on MELON is actually:

    - E(-) – E exists but not in position 2
    - O(-) – O exists but not in position 4
    - N(✓) – N is correctly in position 5.

- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, S, T, M, L
- Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in N, containing E and O, with:

- O not in position 4
- No forbidden letters.

Possible positions for E and O:
E can be in 1, 3, or 4 (but position 4 is taken by N), so 1 or 3.
O can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try to place:
If E is in 1:
E _ _ _ N
Then O must be in 2 or 3:
E O _ _ N → EOGEN? no, EO is valid but need valid word
E _ O _ N → EOBEN? no obvious word
E _ _ O N → but O is position 4 which is forbidden

If E is in 3:
_ _ E _ N
Then O can be in 1 or 2:
O _ E _ N → OBEEN (but B is allowed)
_ O E _ N → BOGEN (but G is allowed)

Let’s check:
OBEEN:
- O, B, E, E, N
- Ends in N, has O and E, E is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 1 (allowed), no forbidden letters. This is a valid English word.

Another candidate: POKEN
- P, O, K, E, N
- Ends in N, has O and E, O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (but 4 is forbidden for O, but O is in 2 here – so OK), no forbidden letters. This is also valid.

Between OBEEN and POKEN, POKEN seems more common. Let’s try POKEN.

Wait, E in POKEN is in position 4 – but we only have constraints on O not being in 4, not E. E can be in 4. So POKEN is valid.

But let’s see if we can find a word where E is in 1 or 3, and O is in 1, 2, or 3.

GENON:
- G, E, N, O, N – but N is duplicated, and ends in N, but O is in 4 (forbidden) – no.

OPENE:
- O, P, E, N, E – ends in E, not N – no.

EBON:

Finally, let’s try POKEN:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify as many correct or misplaced letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (a common consonant)
This gives me a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word at all (marked x).
- N is in the word and in the correct last position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was at position 5; so it must be in positions 1–4).

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ N
- Contains the letters E and N (N is fixed at the end).
- Cannot contain C, R, A.

I want a word that:
- Ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1–4.
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out (like S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E.
- Ends with N.
- Contains E in position 2.
- Uses new letters S, T, O that haven’t been ruled out yet.

That seems optimal for narrowing down further.

   - E was not in position 4 (it also got “-”), so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Good letters left to try: D, L, G, H, M, P, U, Y, I, etc.

I need a 5-letter word ending in N that has both O and E in the first four positions, and avoids forbidden letters. 

One candidate: “OPINE”
- O P I N E
- Ends in N, contains O and E, and uses new letters P, I which haven’t been tested yet.
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know it can’t be in 5, and we’re testing if it can be in 4).

Another candidate: “MELON” – but this has L in position 3, O in 4, E in 2, N in 5. But O was marked “-” when in position 3; putting it in position 4 is fine. However, we already have N locked in 5. The word “MELON” has E in 2, O in 4, N in 5. This fits constraints.

Let me re-interpret the feedback from the last two guesses carefully, because the “-” on N in MELON and POKEN is impossible if N is locked into position 5 (from CRANE).  
I believe the intended meaning is:

- Position 5 is N ✓ (fixed from Guess 1).  
- The “-” for N in later guesses simply means “already locked; no new info”.

So, summarizing:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ N
2. Letters in word: O, E, N (N fixed in 5)
3. Forbidden letters: C, R, A, S, T, M, L, P, K
4. Positional constraints
   – E cannot be in 2 (from MELON feedback)  
   – O cannot be in 2 or 4 (it was in 2 in STONE and got “-”, and in 4 in MELON and got “-”)  
   – Allowed positions for E: 1, 3  
   – Allowed positions for O: 1, 3

We need a 5-letter word ending in N that uses E and O in positions 1 or 3, and uses only allowed letters (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible placements:

- E in 1, O in 3 → E _ O _ N → EOGEN, EOBEN (invalid), etc.  
- O in 1, E in 3 → O _ E _ N → OBEN?  
Actually, look for valid dictionary words:

1. DOG EN → DOGEN (not a common word)  
2. BOGEN (not common)  
3. HOGEN (nope)  

The only common, valid word that fits is “BOGEN” … but “B” is allowed, “O” in 2 is disallowed, so discard.

Next placement: O in 1, E in 3 → O _ E _ N → OBEEN (valid English word, but E is in 2 & 4). But E can be in 4 (only O is banned from 4), so OBEEN is valid.

Wait, let me verify OBEEN:
Letters: O B E E N  
- Ends in N ✓  
- Contains O and E ✓  
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- E in positions 3 and 4 – position 3 is allowed; E not in 2 ✓  
- No forbidden letters ✓  

OBEEN is a recognized variant spelling of “obscene” (used in Scots dialect), acceptable in Wordle lists.

Another candidate: “HOGEN” not valid.  
“FOGEN” not valid.  

Hence OBEEN is the logical next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,OZONE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify as many correct or misplaced letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- N (a common consonant)
This gives me a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word at all (marked x).
- N is in the word and in the correct last position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was at position 5; so it must be in positions 1–4).

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ N
- Contains the letters E and N (N is fixed at the end).
- Cannot contain C, R, A.

I want a word that:
- Ends with N.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1–4.
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out (like S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E.
- Ends with N.
- Contains E in position 2.
- Uses new letters S, T, O that haven’t been ruled out yet.

That seems optimal for narrowing down further.

Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

1. Word ends in N (position 5 is N).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T.
3. Letters present in the word: E, O, N (with N locked in position 5).
4. From STONE we see that:
   - O was not in the right spot (it was in position 3, but got “-” meaning it exists but is misplaced).
   - E was not in position 4 (it also got “-”), so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
   - N is correctly in position 5.
5. So our pattern now is: _ _ _ _ N
   - Must contain O somewhere in 1–4.
   - Must contain E somewhere in 1–3.
   - No S, T, C, R, A.

Good letters left to try: D, L, G, H, M, P, U, Y, I, etc.

I need a 5-letter word ending in N that has both O and E in the first four positions, and avoids forbidden letters. 

One candidate: “OPINE”
- O P I N E
- Ends in N, contains O and E, and uses new letters P, I which haven’t been tested yet.
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since we only know it can’t be in 5, and we’re testing if it can be in 4).

Another candidate: “MELON” – but this has L in position 3, O in 4, E in 2, N in 5. But O was marked “-” when in position 3; putting it in position 4 is fine. However, we already have N locked in 5. The word “MELON” has E in 2, O in 4, N in 5. This fits constraints.

But let me check if MELON uses any forbidden letters: M, E, L, O, N – none of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,S,T) are used. This seems safe.

I’ll go with MELON.

<guess>MELON</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: MELON -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) L(x) O(-) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on MELON:
- M, L are NOT in the word (marked x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (“-” feedback).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (“-” feedback).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (“-” feedback). This is impossible, because position 5 must be N according to CRANE (N✓). The only way N can be “in the word but wrong position” is if the word has another N somewhere else and N is duplicated. That’s unlikely, so the feedback on MELON must be parsed as:
  - The N in position 5 is correct (✓) from CRANE.
  - The feedback on MELON must be interpreted with N as ✓ (since CRANE already locked N at position 5).
  - So the feedback on MELON is actually:
    - M(x), L(x)
    - E(-) – E exists but not in position 2
    - O(-) – O exists but not in position 4
    - N(✓) – N is correctly in position 5.

So updated constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ N
- Contains E (not in position 2) and O (not in position 4)
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, S, T, M, L
- Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in N, containing E and O, with:
- E not in position 2
- O not in position 4
- No forbidden letters.

Possible positions for E and O:
E can be in 1, 3, or 4 (but position 4 is taken by N), so 1 or 3.
O can be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try to place:
If E is in 1:
E _ _ _ N
Then O must be in 2 or 3:
E O _ _ N → EOGEN? no, EO is valid but need valid word
E _ O _ N → EOBEN? no obvious word
E _ _ O N → but O is position 4 which is forbidden

If E is in 3:
_ _ E _ N
Then O can be in 1 or 2:
O _ E _ N → OBEEN (but B is allowed)
_ O E _ N → BOGEN (but G is allowed)

Let’s check:
OBEEN:
- O, B, E, E, N
- Ends in N, has O and E, E is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 1 (allowed), no forbidden letters. This is a valid English word.

Another candidate: POKEN
- P, O, K, E, N
- Ends in N, has O and E, O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (but 4 is forbidden for O, but O is in 2 here – so OK), no forbidden letters. This is also valid.

Between OBEEN and POKEN, POKEN seems more common. Let’s try POKEN.

Wait, E in POKEN is in position 4 – but we only have constraints on O not being in 4, not E. E can be in 4. So POKEN is valid.

But let’s see if we can find a word where E is in 1 or 3, and O is in 1, 2, or 3.

GENON:
- G, E, N, O, N – but N is duplicated, and ends in N, but O is in 4 (forbidden) – no.

OPENE:
- O, P, E, N, E – ends in E, not N – no.

EBON:
- Too short.

Finally, let’s try POKEN:
P O K E N
- P, O, K, E, N
- Ends in N
- Contains O (position 2) and E (position 4) – no constraints violated
- No forbidden letters (C,R,A,S,T,M,L not present)
This seems the best candidate.

That’s unlikely, so the feedback on MELON must be parsed as:\n  - The N in position 5 is correct (✓) from CRANE.\n  - The feedback on MELON must be interpreted with N as ✓ (since CRANE already locked N at position 5).\n  - So the feedback on MELON is actually:\n    - M(x), L(x)\n    - E(-) – E exists but not in position 2\n    - O(-) – O exists but not in position 4\n    - N(✓) – N is correctly in position 5.\n\nSo updated constraints:\n- Pattern: _ _ _ _ N\n- Contains E (not in position 2) and O (not in position 4)\n- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, S, T, M, L\n- Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in N, containing E and O, with:\n- E not in position 2\n- O not in position 4\n- No forbidden letters.\n\nPossible positions for E and O:\nE can be in 1, 3, or 4 (but position 4 is taken by N), so 1 or 3.\nO can be in 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet’s try to place:\nIf E is in 1:\nE _ _ _ N\nThen O must be in 2 or 3:\nE O _ _ N → EOGEN? no, EO is valid but need valid word\nE _ O _ N → EOBEN? no obvious word\nE _ _ O N → but O is position 4 which is forbidden\n\nIf E is in 3:\n_ _ E _ N\nThen O can be in 1 or 2:\nO _ E _ N → OBEEN (but B is allowed)\n_ O E _ N → BOGEN (but G is allowed)\n\nLet’s check:\nOBEEN:\n- O, B, E, E, N\n- Ends in N, has O and E, E is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 1 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

From the entire history:

- Word ends N (position 5).
- Letters in the word: O, E, N.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T, M, L, P, K, B.
- Positional bans:
   – E may not be in 2 (from MELON).
   – E may not be in 3 or 4 (from OBEEN, the E’s both got “-”).
   – O may not be in 2 or 4 (from STONE and MELON).
- Therefore:
   – E must be in position 1.
   – O must be in position 3.
   – Pattern: E _ O _ N

Allowed letters left: D, F, G, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ O _ N.
The only common English word that fits is ELOIN (an archaic/legal term meaning “to remove or carry away”), and all its letters are still allowed.
