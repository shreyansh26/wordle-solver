For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in their most frequent positions to maximize the amount of information I get. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain as many of these common letters as possible. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
- S is very common at the start of words
- L is common in the second position
- A is common in the third position
- T is common in the fourth position
- E is the most common ending letter

This gives me coverage of 5 very common letters in positions where they frequently appear, which should provide good feedback to narrow down the possibilities.

From the feedback:

- S is correct in the 1st position.
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So we know the pattern so far is:  
S _ A _ _

The letters T must appear somewhere else in the word, and we have no information yet about the 2nd and 5th positions. We also know L and E are ruled out.

Good candidates would keep S and A fixed, place T somewhere else (2nd or 5th), and use new common consonants or vowels for the remaining blanks.

Some possibilities:
- S T A _ _  (but then T would be in 2nd, which hasn't been tested)
- S _ A T _  (but T is already known to not be in 4th, so invalid)
- S _ A _ T  (valid placement of T)

Let me try a word like S P A R T, but R hasn't been tested yet and is common. Alternatively S C A R T, but C hasn't been tested. S M A R T is also possible since M hasn't been tested.

I'll choose SMART because:
- Keeps S and A in correct positions (1st and 3rd)
- Uses T in the 5th position (a new placement)
- Includes M and R which are high-frequency untested letters

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain as many of these common letters as possible. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
- S is very common at the start of words
- L is common in the second position
- A is common in the third position
- T is common in the fourth position
- E is the most common ending letter

This gives me coverage of 5 very common letters in positions where they frequently appear, which should provide good feedback to narrow down the possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- S is correct in the 1st position.
- A is correct in the 3rd position.
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So we know the pattern so far is:  
S _ A _ _

The letters T must appear somewhere else in the word, and we have no information yet about the 2nd and 5th positions. We also know L and E are ruled out.

Good candidates would keep S and A fixed, place T somewhere else (2nd or 5th), and use new common consonants or vowels for the remaining blanks.

Some possibilities:
- S T A _ _  (but then T would be in 2nd, which hasn't been tested)
- S _ A T _  (but T is already known to not be in 4th, so invalid)
- S _ A _ T  (valid placement of T)

Let me try a word like S P A R T, but R hasn't been tested yet and is common. Alternatively S C A R T, but C hasn't been tested. S M A R T is also possible since M hasn't been tested.

I'll choose SMART because:
- Keeps S and A in correct positions (1st and 3rd)
- Uses T in the 5th position (a new placement)
- Includes M and R which are high-frequency untested letters

- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters eliminated so far: L, E, M, R
- Letter T is present but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (because:
  – in SLATE it was in position 4 and marked “-”,
  – in SMART it was in position 5 and still marked “-”),
  so T must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is now: S T A _ _

Letters still allowed: any letter except L, E, M, R.
We need two more consonants or vowels for positions 4 and 5 that are not yet ruled out.

Common remaining letters include I, N, O, C, H, D, G, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STAND  (N, D not yet ruled out)
- STASH  (H, S but S already known)
- STACK  (C, K)
- STAID  (I, D)

I’ll choose STAND because N and D are both frequent and neither has been marked x yet.
