For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these.

Popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers some top consonants and vowels
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - similar coverage
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - heavy on vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) - excellent coverage of common letters

After considering these, CRANE seems like a very solid first choice because it includes C (common consonant), R (very common), A (most common vowel), N (common), and E (most common letter overall). This gives good coverage across different letter types and positions.

From the feedback:

- R is NOT in the word
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (correct)
- N is NOT in the word
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (correct)

2. Uses C somewhere (but not position 1)
3. Avoids R and N entirely
4. Uses other common letters to gather more info

- S C A P E (C in position 2)
- S P A C E (C in position 4)
- M A C H E (but A must be position 3)

2. E is in position 5 (✓)
3. C is in the word but not in position 1 or 4 (from CRANE and SPACE feedback)
4. S is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
5. P is not in the word (x)
6. R and N are not in the word (from CRANE feedback)

So far the pattern is:
S _ A _ E

We still need to place C. C cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (positions 1,3,5 are taken by S,A,E respectively, and 4 is eliminated from SPACE feedback). So C must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be: S C A _ E
