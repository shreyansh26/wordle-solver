For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words typically:
1. Use common letters (especially vowels)
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Include a good mix of consonants and vowels

Popular strong starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 4 vowels and S)
- SLATE (good consonant-vowel balance)
- CRANE (common letters)
- RATIO (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO (4 vowels, but U is less common)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers most vowels (A, O, E) plus two very common consonants (R, S). This should quickly reveal which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (all marked with x).
- Only O is in the word, and it is in the correct position (position 3).

We need a 5-letter word where:
1. The third letter is O.
2. It contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. It must be a valid English word.

Let’s think of candidate words fitting this pattern:
- Ends with _ _ O _ _
- Cannot use A, R, S, E
- Possible letters left in the alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some possibilities:
- ""CLOUD"" – uses C, L, U, D, O (but U is questionable, and we want to avoid repeats of letters we’ve ruled out)
- ""MIXED"" – uses M, I, X, E, D (but E is forbidden)
- ""FOULS"" – uses F, O, U, L, S (but S is forbidden)
- ""BLOCK"" – uses B, L, O, C, K (all letters are allowed)
- ""CHOIR"" – uses C, H, O, I, R (but R is forbidden)
- ""DITTO"" – uses D, I, T, T, O (but T is allowed, and I is allowed)

""BLOCK"" seems strong: it keeps O in position 3, introduces new common consonants (B, L, C, K), and avoids forbidden letters.

Another option is ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) – but let’s see if we can do better.

""BLOCK"" is likely the best next guess to maximize information gain while sticking to the constraints.

Let me list what we now know:

1. The third letter is O.
2. None of A, R, S, E, B, C, K are in the word (all marked x).
3. L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _  
Allowed letters: any except A, R, S, E, B, C, K.  
We also know L appears somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).  
Position 3 is already O, so L must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ _ O _ _  
- L appears exactly once (and not in position 2)  
- No forbidden letters.

Possible families:
· L _ O _ _  
· _ _ O L _  
· _ _ O _ L  

Scanning those patterns quickly:
- L O O _ _ → invalid (double O not needed)
- L I O N S → “LIONS” – but S is forbidden
- D O L L → only 4 letters
- F O I L → only 4 letters
- G L O V E → 5 letters but O not in position 3
- F L O W N → 5 letters, O is 3rd, L is 2nd – but L can’t be 2nd (feedback says L is in word but wrong position)
- F L O W N → L is 2nd, so skip
- F O U L S → S is forbidden
- H O L L Y → L appears twice, and Y is allowed but second L is redundant
- D O U L E → not a valid word
- H O L L O → double L and double O
- G L O W N → L is 2nd, skip
- P I L O T → O is 4th, we need O 3rd
- V O I L A → A is forbidden
- V O I D S → S is forbidden
- M O L D Y → L is 3rd but we already have O there, so skip
- G O L D Y → D is allowed, but L is 3rd (conflict with O)
- N O M A D → A is forbidden
- L O O M Y → double O, M, Y allowed, but double O unnecessary
- L O W E R → E, R forbidden
- L O O S E → forbidden letters

A clean candidate is “FLOAT” but A is forbidden.  
Next: “GLOOM” – G, L, O, O, M; double O and L position 2 is ok because L isn’t required to be elsewhere.

Wait, let’s just generate systematically:

Allowed letters now: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and L somewhere else.

Let me list 5-letter words with O in 3rd position and L elsewhere:
- F L O U T – L is 2nd, but feedback says L is in wrong position (allowed to be 2nd? Wait – feedback for BLOCK said L(-) meaning L is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is indeed wrong. Thus L cannot be 2nd. So F L O U T is invalid because L is 2nd.
- F O U L S – wrong position for O
- G L O W N – L is 2nd, invalid
- H O L L Y – L is 4th, but has extra L – let’s avoid duplicates
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid (must be O)
- P L O T S – L is 2nd, invalid
- P O L K A – A forbidden
- S L O T H – S forbidden
- T O N A L – A forbidden
- V O L L Y – double L, invalid
- W O L V E – E forbidden
- D O L L Y – double L

- T O P L Y – not a word

- H O L P Y – not a word
- T O I L S – S forbidden
- T O I L Y – not a word
- W O L F Y – not a word
- F O I L Y – not a word

The valid candidates I can see:
- P O U L T  
- M O U L D  
- H O U L D  
But “HOULD” isn’t a word.  
“POULT” is a word (a young chicken) and fits:
- P O U L T  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- L is 4th (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, E, B, C, K, etc.)

“MOULD” is a word (British spelling of mold) and fits:
- M O U L D  
- O 3rd, L 4th, no forbidden letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words typically:
1. Use common letters (especially vowels)
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Include a good mix of consonants and vowels

Popular strong starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 4 vowels and S)
- SLATE (good consonant-vowel balance)
- CRANE (common letters)
- RATIO (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO (4 vowels, but U is less common)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers most vowels (A, O, E) plus two very common consonants (R, S). This should quickly reveal which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (all marked with x).
- Only O is in the word, and it is in the correct position (position 3).

We need a 5-letter word where:
1. The third letter is O.
2. It contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. It must be a valid English word.

Let’s think of candidate words fitting this pattern:
- Ends with _ _ O _ _
- Cannot use A, R, S, E
- Possible letters left in the alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some possibilities:
- ""CLOUD"" – uses C, L, U, D, O (but U is questionable, and we want to avoid repeats of letters we’ve ruled out)
- ""MIXED"" – uses M, I, X, E, D (but E is forbidden)
- ""FOULS"" – uses F, O, U, L, S (but S is forbidden)
- ""BLOCK"" – uses B, L, O, C, K (all letters are allowed)
- ""CHOIR"" – uses C, H, O, I, R (but R is forbidden)
- ""DITTO"" – uses D, I, T, T, O (but T is allowed, and I is allowed)

""BLOCK"" seems strong: it keeps O in position 3, introduces new common consonants (B, L, C, K), and avoids forbidden letters.

Another option is ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) – but let’s see if we can do better.

""BLOCK"" is likely the best next guess to maximize information gain while sticking to the constraints.

<guess>BLOCK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me list what we now know:

1. The third letter is O.
2. None of A, R, S, E, B, C, K are in the word (all marked x).
3. L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _  
Allowed letters: any except A, R, S, E, B, C, K.  
We also know L appears somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).  
Position 3 is already O, so L must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ _ O _ _  
- L appears exactly once (and not in position 2)  
- No forbidden letters.

Possible families:
· L _ O _ _  
· _ _ O L _  
· _ _ O _ L  

Scanning those patterns quickly:
- L O O _ _ → invalid (double O not needed)
- L I O N S → “LIONS” – but S is forbidden
- D O L L → only 4 letters
- F O I L → only 4 letters
- G L O V E → 5 letters but O not in position 3
- F L O W N → 5 letters, O is 3rd, L is 2nd – but L can’t be 2nd (feedback says L is in word but wrong position)
- F L O W N → L is 2nd, so skip
- F O U L S → S is forbidden
- H O L L Y → L appears twice, and Y is allowed but second L is redundant
- D O U L E → not a valid word
- H O L L O → double L and double O
- G L O W N → L is 2nd, skip
- P I L O T → O is 4th, we need O 3rd
- V O I L A → A is forbidden
- V O I D S → S is forbidden
- M O L D Y → L is 3rd but we already have O there, so skip
- G O L D Y → D is allowed, but L is 3rd (conflict with O)
- N O M A D → A is forbidden
- L O O M Y → double O, M, Y allowed, but double O unnecessary
- L O W E R → E, R forbidden
- L O O S E → forbidden letters

A clean candidate is “FLOAT” but A is forbidden.  
Next: “GLOOM” – G, L, O, O, M; double O and L position 2 is ok because L isn’t required to be elsewhere.

Wait, let’s just generate systematically:

Allowed letters now: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and L somewhere else.

Let me list 5-letter words with O in 3rd position and L elsewhere:
- F L O U T – L is 2nd, but feedback says L is in wrong position (allowed to be 2nd? Wait – feedback for BLOCK said L(-) meaning L is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is indeed wrong. Thus L cannot be 2nd. So F L O U T is invalid because L is 2nd.
- F O U L S – wrong position for O
- G L O W N – L is 2nd, invalid
- H O L L Y – L is 4th, but has extra L – let’s avoid duplicates
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid (must be O)
- P L O T S – L is 2nd, invalid
- P O L K A – A forbidden
- S L O T H – S forbidden
- T O N A L – A forbidden
- V O L L Y – double L, invalid
- W O L V E – E forbidden
- D O L L Y – double L
- P O U L T – P, O, U, L, T – O is 3rd, L is 4th, no forbidden letters
- T O P L Y – not a word
- V O L P T – not a word
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid
- H O L P Y – not a word
- T O I L S – S forbidden
- T O I L Y – not a word
- W O L F Y – not a word
- F O I L Y – not a word

The valid candidates I can see:
- P O U L T  
- M O U L D  
- H O U L D  
But “HOULD” isn’t a word.  
“POULT” is a word (a young chicken) and fits:
- P O U L T  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- L is 4th (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, E, B, C, K, etc.)

“MOULD” is a word (British spelling of mold) and fits:
- M O U L D  
- O 3rd, L 4th, no forbidden letters.

Between POULT and MOULD, both are fine; POULT introduces P, U, T which are new letters, so I’ll go with POULT.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letter positions:
   - Position 3 is definitely O.
   - L is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from BLOCK and POULT feedback).  
     Therefore L must be in position 1.

2. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T (from previous guesses).

3. Letters that remain possible (not yet tried or ruled out):  
   D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Word structure so far:  
   L _ O _ _  
   (because L must be first, O is third).

5. We need two more distinct letters (never tried yet) for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible valid words fitting “L _ O _ _”:
- LOUGH  – but ends with H (valid in British English for a lake)
- LOWLY  – but W and Y are allowed; ends in Y
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOGIN  – but N is allowed, I is allowed
- LODGE  – E forbidden
- LOVER  – R forbidden
- LOATH  – A forbidden
- LORRY  – R forbidden
- LOOMY  – M is allowed, Y is allowed
- LOONY  – N, Y allowed
- LOBBY  – B forbidden
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOUSY  – S forbidden
- LOPED  – P forbidden
- LOWED  – E forbidden
- LOVED  – E forbidden
- LOPING – too long
- LOIN, LOOM, LOOP, LOON, LOUD – but need 5 letters

From the valid 5-letter ones:
- LOUGH (pronounced “lock”, Scots/Irish lake) – uses L, O, U, G, H
- LOONY – uses L, O, O, N, Y – double O but second O is position 3 already
- LOGIN – uses L, O, G, I, N

Among these, LOGIN and LOONY both fit the constraints.  
LOGIN introduces G, I, N (all new), while LOONY re-uses O in position 3, but N and Y are new.  
LOGIN is a more common word and uses all new letters except O.

Structure check:
- L O G I N  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 1st (allowed)  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- No forbidden letters (G, I, N all allowed)  

Hence, LOGIN is a valid next guess.

2. None of A, R, S, E, B, C, K are in the word (all marked x).
3. L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _  
Allowed letters: any except A, R, S, E, B, C, K.  
We also know L appears somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).  
Position 3 is already O, so L must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ _ O _ _  
- L appears exactly once (and not in position 2)  
- No forbidden letters.

Possible families:
· L _ O _ _  
· _ _ O L _  
· _ _ O _ L  

Scanning those patterns quickly:
- L O O _ _ → invalid (double O not needed)
- L I O N S → “LIONS” – but S is forbidden
- D O L L → only 4 letters
- F O I L → only 4 letters
- G L O V E → 5 letters but O not in position 3
- F L O W N → 5 letters, O is 3rd, L is 2nd – but L can’t be 2nd (feedback says L is in word but wrong position)
- F L O W N → L is 2nd, so skip
- F O U L S → S is forbidden
- H O L L Y → L appears twice, and Y is allowed but second L is redundant
- D O U L E → not a valid word
- H O L L O → double L and double O
- G L O W N → L is 2nd, skip
- P I L O T → O is 4th, we need O 3rd
- V O I L A → A is forbidden
- V O I D S → S is forbidden
- M O L D Y → L is 3rd but we already have O there, so skip
- G O L D Y → D is allowed, but L is 3rd (conflict with O)
- N O M A D → A is forbidden
- L O O M Y → double O, M, Y allowed, but double O unnecessary
- L O W E R → E, R forbidden
- L O O S E → forbidden letters

A clean candidate is “FLOAT” but A is forbidden.  
Next: “GLOOM” – G, L, O, O, M; double O and L position 2 is ok because L isn’t required to be elsewhere.

Wait, let’s just generate systematically:

Allowed letters now: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and L somewhere else.

Let me list 5-letter words with O in 3rd position and L elsewhere:
- F L O U T – L is 2nd, but feedback says L is in wrong position (allowed to be 2nd? Wait – feedback for BLOCK said L(-) meaning L is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is indeed wrong. Thus L cannot be 2nd. So F L O U T is invalid because L is 2nd.
- F O U L S – wrong position for O
- G L O W N – L is 2nd, invalid
- H O L L Y – L is 4th, but has extra L – let’s avoid duplicates
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid (must be O)
- P L O T S – L is 2nd, invalid
- P O L K A – A forbidden
- S L O T H – S forbidden
- T O N A L – A forbidden
- V O L L Y – double L, invalid
- W O L V E – E forbidden
- D O L L Y – double L
- P O U L T – P, O, U, L, T – O is 3rd, L is 4th, no forbidden letters
- T O P L Y – not a word
- V O L P T – not a word
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid
- H O L P Y – not a word
- T O I L S – S forbidden
- T O I L Y – not a word
- W O L F Y – not a word
- F O I L Y – not a word

The valid candidates I can see:
- P O U L T  
- M O U L D  
- H O U L D  
But “HOULD” isn’t a word.  
“POULT” is a word (a young chicken) and fits:
- P O U L T  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- L is 4th (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, E, B, C, K, etc.)

“MOULD” is a word (British spelling of mold) and fits:
- M O U L D  
- O 3rd, L 4th, no forbidden letters.

Between POULT and MOULD, both are fine; POULT introduces P, U, T which are new letters, so I’ll go with POULT.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letter positions:
   - Position 3 is definitely O.
   - L is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from BLOCK and POULT feedback).  
     Therefore L must be in position 1.

2. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T (from previous guesses).

3. Letters that remain possible (not yet tried or ruled out):  
   D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Word structure so far:  
   L _ O _ _  
   (because L must be first, O is third).

5. We need two more distinct letters (never tried yet) for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible valid words fitting “L _ O _ _”:
- LOUGH  – but ends with H (valid in British English for a lake)
- LOWLY  – but W and Y are allowed; ends in Y
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOGIN  – but N is allowed, I is allowed
- LODGE  – E forbidden
- LOVER  – R forbidden
- LOATH  – A forbidden
- LORRY  – R forbidden
- LOOMY  – M is allowed, Y is allowed
- LOONY  – N, Y allowed
- LOBBY  – B forbidden
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOUSY  – S forbidden
- LOPED  – P forbidden
- LOWED  – E forbidden
- LOVED  – E forbidden
- LOPING – too long
- LOIN, LOOM, LOOP, LOON, LOUD – but need 5 letters

From the valid 5-letter ones:
- LOUGH (pronounced “lock”, Scots/Irish lake) – uses L, O, U, G, H
- LOONY – uses L, O, O, N, Y – double O but second O is position 3 already
- LOGIN – uses L, O, G, I, N

Among these, LOGIN and LOONY both fit the constraints.  
LOGIN introduces G, I, N (all new), while LOONY re-uses O in position 3, but N and Y are new.  
LOGIN is a more common word and uses all new letters except O.

Let’s choose LOGIN.

Structure check:
- L O G I N  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 1st (allowed)  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- No forbidden letters (G, I, N all allowed)  

Hence, LOGIN is a valid next guess.

Let’s reinterpret the feedback now that we’ve seen LOGIN.

1. Position 3 is still O (from AROSE and BLOCK).
2. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T, I, N, G.  
   (Collected from all four guesses.)

3. Feedback on LOGIN:  
   L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was in position 1 here, so now we know L cannot be 1st).  
   O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   G(-)  → G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   I(x) and N(x) → I and N are NOT in the word.

Wait – this is internally inconsistent with earlier feedback:
- Earlier we were told O is in position 3 (✓ from AROSE and BLOCK), so if LOGIN says O is “-” (wrong position) that would contradict the earlier ✓.  
Therefore I must have misread the LOGIN feedback.

Re-reading carefully: the feedback for LOGIN is L(-) O(-) G(-) I(x) N(x).

- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- G(-) → G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- I(x) and N(x) → I and N are NOT in the word.

This **directly contradicts** the earlier fact that position 3 is O (from AROSE and BLOCK). The only way both can be true is if the feedback for LOGIN is being reported incorrectly or if I misinterpreted the earlier feedback.  
But per the instructions, we must accept the feedback as given.

Hence the correct interpretation is:

- **O is in the word but its correct position is NOT 3** (from LOGIN’s O(-), overriding any prior ✓).  
  I.e., the earlier “O(✓)” in AROSE and BLOCK must have meant “O is in the word and position 3 is correct” was **superseded** by LOGIN’s feedback that O is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  (Wordle rules do not allow retraction, but the host’s feedback here overrides.)  

Therefore we must treat:

- O is in the word, but **not** in position 3.  
- L is in the word, but **not** in positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, from earlier:
   - In BLOCK, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 2.  
   - In POULT, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 4.  
   - In LOGIN, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 1.  
   So L must be in **position 5** (only remaining spot).

- Further, all letters tried so far that are forbidden:  
  A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T, I, N, G.

- Word structure now must be:  
  _ _ _ _ L  (L in position 5)  
  O must be in one of positions 1,2,4 (not 3 or 5)  
  Other three letters must be chosen from remaining allowed alphabet:  
  D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s examine possible 5-letter words fitting “X X X O L” or “X X O X L” or “O X X X L”.

Try “HYPOL” – no, that’s not a word.

“LOWLY” – O is 2nd, but L must be 5th – no.

“FOYOL” – not a word.

“MOXOL” – not a word.

“WOOLY” – has two O’s and L in 5th, O in 2nd – valid English word (wooly) but has double O.  
Let’s see if “WOOLY” is acceptable. It is 5 letters, W-O-O-L-Y, L in 5th, O in 2nd (allowed), uses W, O, Y which are all allowed.

Another candidate: “WORLD” – R and D, but R is forbidden.

“DOOLY” – D, O, O, L, Y – L is 5th, O in 2nd and 3rd – but 3rd is now NOT O (per LOGIN feedback), so only one O allowed. Also we need to avoid double letters to maximize information.

“DOOLY” invalid due to double O.

“DOYOL” – not a word.

“HUDOL” – not a word.

“FUMOL” – not a word.

“HODOL” – not a word.

“JUMOL” – not a word.

“VODOL” – not a word.

“WOMOL” – not a word.

“WODOL” – not a word.

“VOYOL” – not a word.

“DOYEL” – E forbidden.

“FIXOL” – I forbidden.

“FOXLY” – not a word.

“FLYOL” – not a word.

“JOWLY” – J, O, W, L, Y – L is 5th, O is 2nd, remaining letters J, W, Y are allowed. “JOWLY” is a valid English word meaning “having large jowls”.

Hence JOWLY is a valid candidate.

Structure check:
- J O W L Y  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 5th (allowed)  
- O is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd)  
- No forbidden letters (J, W, Y allowed)

Hence JOWLY is the next guess.

  D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s examine possible 5-letter words fitting “X X X O L” or “X X O X L” or “O X X X L”.

Try “HYPOL” – no, that’s not a word.

“LOWLY” – O is 2nd, but L must be 5th – no.

“FOYOL” – not a word.

“MOXOL” – not a word.

“WOOLY” – has two O’s and L in 5th, O in 2nd – valid English word (wooly) but has double O.  
Let’s see if “WOOLY” is acceptable. It is 5 letters, W-O-O-L-Y, L in 5th, O in 2nd (allowed), uses W, O, Y which are all allowed.

Another candidate: “WORLD” – R and D, but R is forbidden.

“DOOLY” – D, O, O, L, Y – L is 5th, O in 2nd and 3rd – but 3rd is now NOT O (per LOGIN feedback), so only one O allowed. Also we need to avoid double letters to maximize information.

“DOOLY” invalid due to double O.

“DOYOL” – not a word.

“HUDOL” – not a word.

“FUMOL” – not a word.

“HODOL” – not a word.

“JUMOL” – not a word.

“VODOL” – not a word.

“WOMOL” – not a word.

“WODOL” – not a word.

“VOYOL” – not a word.

“DOYEL” – E forbidden.

“FIXOL” – I forbidden.

“FOXLY” – not a word.

“FLYOL” – not a word.

“JOWLY” – J, O, W, L, Y – L is 5th, O is 2nd, remaining letters J, W, Y are allowed. “JOWLY” is a valid English word meaning “having large jowls”.

Hence JOWLY is a valid candidate.

Structure check:
- J O W L Y  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 5th (allowed)  
- O is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd)  
- No forbidden letters (J, W, Y allowed)

Hence JOWLY is the next guess.",Guess 5: JOWLY -> FEEDBACK: J(x) O(-) W(x) L(-) Y(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words typically:
1. Use common letters (especially vowels)
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Include a good mix of consonants and vowels

Popular strong starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 4 vowels and S)
- SLATE (good consonant-vowel balance)
- CRANE (common letters)
- RATIO (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO (4 vowels, but U is less common)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers most vowels (A, O, E) plus two very common consonants (R, S). This should quickly reveal which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (all marked with x).
- Only O is in the word, and it is in the correct position (position 3).

We need a 5-letter word where:
1. The third letter is O.
2. It contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. It must be a valid English word.

Let’s think of candidate words fitting this pattern:
- Ends with _ _ O _ _
- Cannot use A, R, S, E
- Possible letters left in the alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Some possibilities:
- ""CLOUD"" – uses C, L, U, D, O (but U is questionable, and we want to avoid repeats of letters we’ve ruled out)
- ""MIXED"" – uses M, I, X, E, D (but E is forbidden)
- ""FOULS"" – uses F, O, U, L, S (but S is forbidden)
- ""BLOCK"" – uses B, L, O, C, K (all letters are allowed)
- ""CHOIR"" – uses C, H, O, I, R (but R is forbidden)
- ""DITTO"" – uses D, I, T, T, O (but T is allowed, and I is allowed)

""BLOCK"" seems strong: it keeps O in position 3, introduces new common consonants (B, L, C, K), and avoids forbidden letters.

Another option is ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) – but let’s see if we can do better.

""BLOCK"" is likely the best next guess to maximize information gain while sticking to the constraints.

<guess>BLOCK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me list what we now know:

1. The third letter is O.
2. None of A, R, S, E, B, C, K are in the word (all marked x).
3. L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _  
Allowed letters: any except A, R, S, E, B, C, K.  
We also know L appears somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).  
Position 3 is already O, so L must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ _ O _ _  
- L appears exactly once (and not in position 2)  
- No forbidden letters.

Possible families:
· L _ O _ _  
· _ _ O L _  
· _ _ O _ L  

Scanning those patterns quickly:
- L O O _ _ → invalid (double O not needed)
- L I O N S → “LIONS” – but S is forbidden
- D O L L → only 4 letters
- F O I L → only 4 letters
- G L O V E → 5 letters but O not in position 3
- F L O W N → 5 letters, O is 3rd, L is 2nd – but L can’t be 2nd (feedback says L is in word but wrong position)
- F L O W N → L is 2nd, so skip
- F O U L S → S is forbidden
- H O L L Y → L appears twice, and Y is allowed but second L is redundant
- D O U L E → not a valid word
- H O L L O → double L and double O
- G L O W N → L is 2nd, skip
- P I L O T → O is 4th, we need O 3rd
- V O I L A → A is forbidden
- V O I D S → S is forbidden
- M O L D Y → L is 3rd but we already have O there, so skip
- G O L D Y → D is allowed, but L is 3rd (conflict with O)
- N O M A D → A is forbidden
- L O O M Y → double O, M, Y allowed, but double O unnecessary
- L O W E R → E, R forbidden
- L O O S E → forbidden letters

A clean candidate is “FLOAT” but A is forbidden.  
Next: “GLOOM” – G, L, O, O, M; double O and L position 2 is ok because L isn’t required to be elsewhere.

Wait, let’s just generate systematically:

Allowed letters now: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 3 and L somewhere else.

Let me list 5-letter words with O in 3rd position and L elsewhere:
- F L O U T – L is 2nd, but feedback says L is in wrong position (allowed to be 2nd? Wait – feedback for BLOCK said L(-) meaning L is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is indeed wrong. Thus L cannot be 2nd. So F L O U T is invalid because L is 2nd.
- F O U L S – wrong position for O
- G L O W N – L is 2nd, invalid
- H O L L Y – L is 4th, but has extra L – let’s avoid duplicates
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid (must be O)
- P L O T S – L is 2nd, invalid
- P O L K A – A forbidden
- S L O T H – S forbidden
- T O N A L – A forbidden
- V O L L Y – double L, invalid
- W O L V E – E forbidden
- D O L L Y – double L
- P O U L T – P, O, U, L, T – O is 3rd, L is 4th, no forbidden letters
- T O P L Y – not a word
- V O L P T – not a word
- M O L D Y – L is 3rd, invalid
- H O L P Y – not a word
- T O I L S – S forbidden
- T O I L Y – not a word
- W O L F Y – not a word
- F O I L Y – not a word

The valid candidates I can see:
- P O U L T  
- M O U L D  
- H O U L D  
But “HOULD” isn’t a word.  
“POULT” is a word (a young chicken) and fits:
- P O U L T  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- L is 4th (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S, E, B, C, K, etc.)

“MOULD” is a word (British spelling of mold) and fits:
- M O U L D  
- O 3rd, L 4th, no forbidden letters.

Between POULT and MOULD, both are fine; POULT introduces P, U, T which are new letters, so I’ll go with POULT.

<guess>POULT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: POULT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) U(-) L(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letter positions:
   - Position 3 is definitely O.
   - L is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from BLOCK and POULT feedback).  
     Therefore L must be in position 1.

2. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T (from previous guesses).

3. Letters that remain possible (not yet tried or ruled out):  
   D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Word structure so far:  
   L _ O _ _  
   (because L must be first, O is third).

5. We need two more distinct letters (never tried yet) for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible valid words fitting “L _ O _ _”:
- LOUGH  – but ends with H (valid in British English for a lake)
- LOWLY  – but W and Y are allowed; ends in Y
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOGIN  – but N is allowed, I is allowed
- LODGE  – E forbidden
- LOVER  – R forbidden
- LOATH  – A forbidden
- LORRY  – R forbidden
- LOOMY  – M is allowed, Y is allowed
- LOONY  – N, Y allowed
- LOBBY  – B forbidden
- LOFTY  – T forbidden
- LOUSY  – S forbidden
- LOPED  – P forbidden
- LOWED  – E forbidden
- LOVED  – E forbidden
- LOPING – too long
- LOIN, LOOM, LOOP, LOON, LOUD – but need 5 letters

From the valid 5-letter ones:
- LOUGH (pronounced “lock”, Scots/Irish lake) – uses L, O, U, G, H
- LOONY – uses L, O, O, N, Y – double O but second O is position 3 already
- LOGIN – uses L, O, G, I, N

Among these, LOGIN and LOONY both fit the constraints.  
LOGIN introduces G, I, N (all new), while LOONY re-uses O in position 3, but N and Y are new.  
LOGIN is a more common word and uses all new letters except O.

Let’s choose LOGIN.

Structure check:
- L O G I N  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 1st (allowed)  
- O is 3rd (correct)  
- No forbidden letters (G, I, N all allowed)  

Hence, LOGIN is a valid next guess.

<guess>LOGIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: POULT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) U(-) L(-) T(x)
Guess 4: LOGIN -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(-) G(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s reinterpret the feedback now that we’ve seen LOGIN.

1. Position 3 is still O (from AROSE and BLOCK).
2. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T, I, N, G.  
   (Collected from all four guesses.)

3. Feedback on LOGIN:  
   L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was in position 1 here, so now we know L cannot be 1st).  
   O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   G(-)  → G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   I(x) and N(x) → I and N are NOT in the word.

Wait – this is internally inconsistent with earlier feedback:
- Earlier we were told O is in position 3 (✓ from AROSE and BLOCK), so if LOGIN says O is “-” (wrong position) that would contradict the earlier ✓.  
Therefore I must have misread the LOGIN feedback.

Re-reading carefully: the feedback for LOGIN is L(-) O(-) G(-) I(x) N(x).

- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- G(-) → G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- I(x) and N(x) → I and N are NOT in the word.

This **directly contradicts** the earlier fact that position 3 is O (from AROSE and BLOCK). The only way both can be true is if the feedback for LOGIN is being reported incorrectly or if I misinterpreted the earlier feedback.  
But per the instructions, we must accept the feedback as given.

Hence the correct interpretation is:

- **O is in the word but its correct position is NOT 3** (from LOGIN’s O(-), overriding any prior ✓).  
  I.e., the earlier “O(✓)” in AROSE and BLOCK must have meant “O is in the word and position 3 is correct” was **superseded** by LOGIN’s feedback that O is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  (Wordle rules do not allow retraction, but the host’s feedback here overrides.)  

Therefore we must treat:

- O is in the word, but **not** in position 3.  
- L is in the word, but **not** in positions 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, from earlier:
   - In BLOCK, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 2.  
   - In POULT, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 4.  
   - In LOGIN, L(-) meant L was in word but **not** in position 1.  
   So L must be in **position 5** (only remaining spot).

- Further, all letters tried so far that are forbidden:  
  A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T, I, N, G.

- Word structure now must be:  
  _ _ _ _ L  (L in position 5)  
  O must be in one of positions 1,2,4 (not 3 or 5)  
  Other three letters must be chosen from remaining allowed alphabet:  
  D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s examine possible 5-letter words fitting “X X X O L” or “X X O X L” or “O X X X L”.

Try “HYPOL” – no, that’s not a word.

“LOWLY” – O is 2nd, but L must be 5th – no.

“FOYOL” – not a word.

“MOXOL” – not a word.

“WOOLY” – has two O’s and L in 5th, O in 2nd – valid English word (wooly) but has double O.  
Let’s see if “WOOLY” is acceptable. It is 5 letters, W-O-O-L-Y, L in 5th, O in 2nd (allowed), uses W, O, Y which are all allowed.

Another candidate: “WORLD” – R and D, but R is forbidden.

“DOOLY” – D, O, O, L, Y – L is 5th, O in 2nd and 3rd – but 3rd is now NOT O (per LOGIN feedback), so only one O allowed. Also we need to avoid double letters to maximize information.

“DOOLY” invalid due to double O.

“DOYOL” – not a word.

“HUDOL” – not a word.

“FUMOL” – not a word.

“HODOL” – not a word.

“JUMOL” – not a word.

“VODOL” – not a word.

“WOMOL” – not a word.

“WODOL” – not a word.

“VOYOL” – not a word.

“DOYEL” – E forbidden.

“FIXOL” – I forbidden.

“FOXLY” – not a word.

“FLYOL” – not a word.

“JOWLY” – J, O, W, L, Y – L is 5th, O is 2nd, remaining letters J, W, Y are allowed. “JOWLY” is a valid English word meaning “having large jowls”.

Hence JOWLY is a valid candidate.

Structure check:
- J O W L Y  
  positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
- L is 5th (allowed)  
- O is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd)  
- No forbidden letters (J, W, Y allowed)

Hence JOWLY is the next guess.

Let me carefully reconcile the feedback, because the LOGIN and JOWLY results appear to contradict earlier feedback.

Summary of the feedback:
1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word and is in position 3.

2. BLOCK → B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   ⇒ O is still in position 3 (✓), and L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. POULT → P(x) O(-) U(-) L(-) T(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 3, and L is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   This conflicts with the first two pieces that said O is in position 3.

4. LOGIN → L(-) O(-) G(-) I(x) N(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 3, and L is in the word but NOT in position 1, and G is in the word but NOT in position 3.

5. JOWLY → J(x) O(-) W(x) L(-) Y(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word but NOT in position 3, and L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

The only way all five feedback lines can be simultaneously true is if the ✓ in the first two guesses was a reporting error, and the host’s later feedback takes precedence.  Under the host’s latest feedback we must now treat:

- O is in the word, but NOT in position 3.  
- L is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from LOGIN, BLOCK, POULT, JOWLY).  
  Therefore L must be in position 5.

Forbidden letters accumulated from all guesses:  
A, R, S, E, B, C, K, P, T, I, N, G, J, W, Y.

Word pattern:  _ _ _ _ L   (L in slot 5) and O must sit in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Allowed remaining letters: D, F, H, M, Q, V, X, Z.

Enumerate valid 5-letter words fitting “_ _ _ _ L” with O somewhere else and no forbidden letters:

- MOULD – M, O, U, L, D  
  – O is 2nd (allowed), L is 5th (required).  
  – M, U, D are still allowed.  
  – Valid English word.

- FOUL D – but F, O, U, L, D is “FOULD”, not standard.  
- DOUL D – not a word.  
- HOULD – not a word.  

Only “MOULD” is a standard English 5-letter word that satisfies every constraint.

So MOULD is the only viable candidate left.
