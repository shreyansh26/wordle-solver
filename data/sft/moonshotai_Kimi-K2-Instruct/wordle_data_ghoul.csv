For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opener because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about multiple letters and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
S(x) – S is not in the word.
L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second letter).
A(x) – A is not in the word.
T(x) – T is not in the word.
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, A, T, E
- Letter that is in the word: L (but not in position 2)

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2
- Uses none of the letters S, A, T, E

Good candidates often include other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.  
Possible consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y, plus L  
Possible vowels still allowed: I, O, U

A strong second guess that meets these rules and mixes common remaining letters is “BLOND”:
- Contains L (and it’s in position 2 here, so if L is elsewhere it will get “-”).  
- Uses fresh, common consonants B, N, D and vowels O.  
- Avoids S, A, T, E.

From the feedback so far:

Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, B, N, D, F, I, C, K  
Letters known to be IN the word:  
- L (but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 – so it must be in position 1 or 5)  
- O in position 3

Word pattern so far:  
_ _ O _ _  with L in 1 or 5

Consonants still allowed: G, H, M, P, R, V, W, Y  
Vowels still allowed: U

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Contains L (in 1 or 5)
- Only uses letters not yet ruled out
- Tests as many new consonants as possible

Possible structures:
- L _ O _ _  or  _ _ O _ L

Based on the constraints, the only remaining vowel is U, and L must appear in position 1 or 5. The pattern is _ _ O _ L. A valid word matching this is GHOUL. It uses only letters not yet ruled out (G, H, U, L) and tests two new consonants (G and H).
