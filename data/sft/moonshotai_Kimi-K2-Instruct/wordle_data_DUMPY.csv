For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. Ideally, the guess should include common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the word. A common strategy is to use a word that contains frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One such word is ""RAISE"", which includes R, A, I, S, E - all common letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"". Between these, ""RAISE"" seems slightly better because it includes S and E, which are very common. However, ""AROSE"" includes O, which is also a common vowel. 

After considering a few options, ""AROSE"" is a solid first guess because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all high-frequency letters. This gives us the best chance to quickly narrow down possible letters in the word.

All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s actually very useful information: we can eliminate A, R, O, S, E from every position.

What letters have we not touched yet?  
We still have most of the consonants and vowels left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

To maximize the new information, we want a word made entirely of fresh letters and ideally containing the next-most-common set of letters.  
A classic second-guess in this situation is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y), because U, I, N, T are very common and Y is also useful to check.

Another solid candidate would be “UNTIL”, but I’ll go with “UNITY” to cover U, N, I, T, Y all at once.

- U is present but not in position 1.
- Y is present and already in the correct position 5.

So the unknown letters are in positions 1-4, the only vowel still available (besides Y) is U, and consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Y is fixed at the end, so we have _ _ _ _ Y.

We know U must appear somewhere in positions 2-4.  
Among the still-available consonants, we want to pick three that are common so we get maximal information.  
A good triple is L, D, and H, giving us a word like DULHY, but that’s not valid. Another valid option is LUMPY (but P has not been ruled out yet, and P is available).  
We need a valid 5-letter word that has Y last, one U, and three of the remaining consonants.  
A valid word that fits is LUMPY (L, U, M, P, Y).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. Ideally, the guess should include common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the word. A common strategy is to use a word that contains frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One such word is ""RAISE"", which includes R, A, I, S, E - all common letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"". Between these, ""RAISE"" seems slightly better because it includes S and E, which are very common. However, ""AROSE"" includes O, which is also a common vowel. 

After considering a few options, ""AROSE"" is a solid first guess because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all high-frequency letters. This gives us the best chance to quickly narrow down possible letters in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s actually very useful information: we can eliminate A, R, O, S, E from every position.

What letters have we not touched yet?  
We still have most of the consonants and vowels left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

To maximize the new information, we want a word made entirely of fresh letters and ideally containing the next-most-common set of letters.  
A classic second-guess in this situation is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y), because U, I, N, T are very common and Y is also useful to check.

Another solid candidate would be “UNTIL”, but I’ll go with “UNITY” to cover U, N, I, T, Y all at once.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(x) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T are all absent.
- U is present but not in position 1.
- Y is present and already in the correct position 5.

So the unknown letters are in positions 1-4, the only vowel still available (besides Y) is U, and consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Y is fixed at the end, so we have _ _ _ _ Y.

We know U must appear somewhere in positions 2-4.  
Among the still-available consonants, we want to pick three that are common so we get maximal information.  
A good triple is L, D, and H, giving us a word like DULHY, but that’s not valid. Another valid option is LUMPY (but P has not been ruled out yet, and P is available).  
We need a valid 5-letter word that has Y last, one U, and three of the remaining consonants.  
A valid word that fits is LUMPY (L, U, M, P, Y).  
Other possibilities are DUMPY, HUMPY, etc., but LUMPY uses three fresh consonants and places U in position 2.

Let’s go with LUMPY.
