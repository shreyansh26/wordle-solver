For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good first guess should have a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S) 
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving me maximum information
- It covers a good range of letters that appear frequently in English words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has pattern:
- 1st letter: unknown, but not A or O
- 2nd letter: R
- 3rd letter: unknown, but not O
- 4th letter: unknown, but not S
- 5th letter: unknown, but E is in the word somewhere (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4)

Now I need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has E somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Doesn't use A, O, S
- Common letters: let's try consonants like T, N, L, D, C, etc. and vowels I, U

Some possible patterns:
- _ R _ E _ (E in 4th position)
- E R _ _ _ (E in 1st position)
- _ R E _ _ (E in 3rd position)

I'll try ""TREND"":
- T (position 1) - new letter
- R (position 2) - confirmed correct
- E (position 3) - possible position for E
- N (position 4) - new letter
- D (position 5) - new letter

This uses common letters and tests E in position 3.

Updated knowledge from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _ with E somewhere in the word (but not in the 3rd position).

2. TREND → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is now confirmed in position 1.
   - R is still confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position, so E must be in the 4th or 5th slot.
   - N and D are not in the word.

Current pattern:
1: T
2: R
3: not E, not O, not S, not N, not D
4: could be E or another letter
5: could be E or another letter (but E can only appear once)

Remaining vowels to consider: I, U
Remaining common consonants: C, L, M, P, etc.

Because E must be in 4th or 5th position, I’ll test E in 4th with common letters in 3rd and 5th:
Possible word: T R I E _

Let’s pick a common consonant for the 5th slot. “TRI” + “E” + “D” is invalid (D already ruled out). “TRI” + “E” + “M” = TRIEM – not a valid English word. “TRI” + “E” + “L” = TRIEL – not valid. “TRI” + “E” + “K” = TRIEK – not valid.

Next option: E in 5th position, pattern T R _ _ E
Common consonants for 3rd and 4th could be L and M: T R I M E → TRIME – not valid. T R I P E → TRIPE – valid word.

TRIPE:
- T(1): ✓
- R(2): ✓
- I(3): new letter
- P(4): new letter
- E(5): checks the “E must be in 4 or 5” constraint.
