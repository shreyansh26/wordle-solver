For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they cover many common letters.

Looking at the options:
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - all common letters
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - also strong
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes both S and T (very common starting letters), plus L, A, and E which are all high-frequency letters. This should give good coverage across different word patterns.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word AND in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so it must appear somewhere other than 4th
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so it must appear somewhere other than 5th

So we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain T and E, but T cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5
- Cannot contain S or A

Possible placements:
- T could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2 is already L, so 1, 3, or 5)
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 2 is L, so 1, 3, or 4)

Let's try putting T in position 1 and E in position 3: T L E _ _
That would make a word starting with TL... but few valid words start with TL.

Let's try T in position 3: _ L T _ _
E could be in 1 or 4. E in 1: E L T _ _
E in 4: _ L T E _

Another pattern: E in 1, T in 5: E L _ _ T
Possible word: ELINT (but that's not common)
ELATE - but has A which we know is excluded
ELITE - has I, which is possible
ELECT - has C

Looking at common patterns, let's try:
- EL _ _ T: ELINT (rare), ELMNT (invalid)
- _ L E T _: B L E T S (invalid)
- _ L T E _: A L T E R (but has A)
- P L E T O (invalid)

A common word that fits: ELITE (E-L-I-T-E)
Wait, but E cannot be in position 5, but ELITE has E in positions 1 and 5 - this would be invalid because the second E is in position 5 which is the same as original position.

Let's try: B L E N T
- B L E N T: valid word ""BLENT"" (past tense of blend)
But ""BLENT"" is not very common.

Another option: P L E A T - but has A which is excluded.

CLERK: C-L-E-R-K
- Fits _ L _ _ _ pattern
- Has E in position 3 (acceptable, original was position 5)
- Has no T - this would violate that T must be in word

GLENT: G-L-E-N-T
- Valid word ""GLENT"" (Scottish word, not common)

Let's try: F L E E T
- F L E E T: 
  - _ L _ _ _ pattern
  - Contains T (position 5 - acceptable since original was position 4)
  - Contains E (position 3 - acceptable since original was position 5)
  - Does not contain S or A

2. FLEET → F(x) L(✓) E(✓) E(-) T(✓)

So we need a word of the form ? L E ? T, using only letters we have not ruled out.

- C L E F T – F excluded
- D L E P T – invalid
- E L E C T – but we already have L E _ T
   - ELECT: E L E C T – fits: E(1) L(2) E(3) C(4) T(5)
   - Check exclusions: does not use S, A, F
   - L is in position 2 (correct)

- C L E F T – F excluded
- D L E P T – invalid
- E L E C T – but we already have L E _ T
   - ELECT: E L E C T – fits: E(1) L(2) E(3) C(4) T(5)
   - Check exclusions: does not use S, A, F
   - L is in position 2 (correct)
   - E is in position 3 (correct)
   - T is in position 5 (correct)
   - And no forbidden letters.

So ELECT seems perfect.",Guess 3: ELECT -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(✓) E(✓) C(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
