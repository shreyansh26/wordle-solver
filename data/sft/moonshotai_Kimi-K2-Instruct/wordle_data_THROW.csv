For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, to cover as much ground as possible. 

Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular first guesses for this reason. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes some of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S), giving us a good chance to identify or eliminate several letters early on.

From the feedback on arose:
- A is **not** in the word (x).
- R is in the word but **wrong position** (-) — so R is not in position 2.
- O is in the word but **wrong position** (-) — so O is not in position 3.
- S is **not** in the word (x).
- E is **not** in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, S, E
- Letters confirmed present: R (not in 2nd), O (not in 3rd)

1. Contains R somewhere other than position 2
2. Contains O somewhere other than position 3
3. Does **not** contain A, S, E

Good consonants and vowels we can still use: T, N, L, C, P, D, U, I, etc.
A balanced word might be “ROTOR” but that repeats R and O and is unlikely.

- F (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2 → but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Try “NORTH”:

From the total feedback so far:

1. Excluded letters: A, S, E, N  
2. Confirmed letters and positions:  
   - R(✓) is in position 3  
3. Confirmed letters but wrong positions:  
   - O is in the word but not at position 2 or 3 (since it was “-” in both arose and north)  
   - T is in the word but not at position 4  
   - H is in the word but not at position 5  

So the word must:  
- Have R in slot 3  
- Include O, T, H in other slots, avoiding positions already ruled out  
- Exclude A, S, E, N  

Possible placements:  
- O cannot be slot 2 or 3 → must be 1, 4 or 5  
- T cannot be slot 4 → must be 1, 2 or 5  
- H cannot be slot 5 → must be 1, 2 or 4  

We also need one more distinct letter (not yet used).  
Good remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (O is already known to be present)

Let’s try a word that satisfies all constraints and covers new letters.  
First idea: C O R T H → CORTH (invalid, not a word).  
Second idea: T O R C H → TORCH  
- R is in slot 3 ✓  
- O is in slot 2 — but we were told O is NOT in slot 2 (from arose feedback). So this fails.

Third idea: T R O P H → invalid, R must be slot 3.  
Fourth idea: P O R T H → PORTH (not a valid word).

Fifth idea: C H O R T → CHORT (valid word? “CHORT” is a rare variant of “chert,” but not common).  
Sixth idea: H O R T C → HORTC (invalid).

Seventh idea: C R O W T → CROWT (invalid).

Let me step back and list valid 5-letter words with R in slot 3 and containing O, T, H, using only allowed letters.

Known constraints:  
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _  
- Must include O, T, H  
- Must NOT include A, S, E, N  
- Additional letter should be unused (C, D, F, G, L, M, P, U, I, etc.)

Try:  
- G R O U T (uses G, U)  
  - R is slot 3 ✓  
  - O is slot 2 ✓ (allowed; arose only forbid O in slot 3)  
  - T is slot 5 ✓ (allowed; north only forbid T in slot 4)  
  - H is missing — fails.

- F R O T H (uses F)  
  - R slot 3 ✓  
  - O slot 2 ✓  
  - T slot 4 — but north said T is not in slot 4. So T in slot 4 is invalid. This fails.

- M O R T H → MORT H (invalid, not a word).

- C O R T H → CORTH (invalid).

- P R O T H → PROTH (invalid).

- T R O W H → TROWH (invalid).

- B R O T H → BROTH  
  - R slot 3 ✓  
  - O slot 2 ✓  
  - T slot 4 — again, T not allowed in slot 4. Fails.

- H O R T A → contains A (excluded). Fails.

- D R O U T  
  - R slot 3 ✓  
  - O slot 2 ✓  
  - T slot 5 ✓  
  - H is missing — fails.

We need O, T, H all to appear and R in slot 3, with no A,S,E,N.  
A valid arrangement is:  
O _ R T _ → O R T H _ → ORTH? But we need 5 letters.

Try:  
- W R O T H → WROTH (a valid word meaning “angry”)

Check constraints:  
- W (new letter)  
- R is slot 3 ✓  
- O is slot 2 ✓ (allowed)  
- T is slot 4 — but north said T is not in slot 4. So this fails.

Try:  
H O R T _ → HORT? (invalid).

Try:  
T H R O _ → THRO B (invalid).

Try:  
T _ R O H → T R O H _ → TROPH? (invalid).

Try:  
C H R O T → CHROT (invalid).

Wait, we need all three O, T, H plus R in slot 3.  
The only slot remaining for T is 1 or 5 (since 4 is forbidden).  
Similarly O must be 1,4,5 (not 2,3).  
H must be 1,2,4 (not 5).  

Possible pattern:  
If we put T in 1: T _ R _ _  
Then O and H must be in 4,5 (but H can’t be 5). So H at 4, O at 5 → T _ R H O  
Need a letter at slot 2: T ? R H O  
Valid word: T R O P H → TROPH (invalid).

Alternative: T H R O _ → THRO? (4 letters). No.

Alternative: O _ R T H  
O ? R T H → O ? R T H → need a letter at slot 2.  
Valid word: O B R T H → invalid.

Alternative: O T R _ _ → O T R _ _ → O T R ? ? → but we need H somewhere.  
H can’t be here easily.

Another approach: use D.  
D R O U T — H missing.  
D R O W T — H missing.  

Realizing I’m missing a clear candidate, let’s try:  
T H R O W  
- R is slot 3 ✓  
- O is slot 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- T is slot 1 ✓ (allowed)  
- H is slot 2 ✓ (allowed)  
- W is new letter  
This word satisfies everything: THROW  
Letters: T, H, R, O, W  
Excluded letters avoided: A, S, E, N  
Positions:  
- O not in 2 or 3 ✓ (it’s 4)  
- T not in 4 ✓ (it’s 1)  
- H not in 5 ✓ (it’s 2)

So THROW meets all constraints.

Try:  
C H R O T → CHROT (invalid).

Wait, we need all three O, T, H plus R in slot 3.  
The only slot remaining for T is 1 or 5 (since 4 is forbidden).  
Similarly O must be 1,4,5 (not 2,3).  
H must be 1,2,4 (not 5).  

Possible pattern:  
If we put T in 1: T _ R _ _  
Then O and H must be in 4,5 (but H can’t be 5). So H at 4, O at 5 → T _ R H O  
Need a letter at slot 2: T ? R H O  
Valid word: T R O P H → TROPH (invalid).

Alternative: T H R O _ → THRO? (4 letters). No.

Alternative: O _ R T H  
O ? R T H → O ? R T H → need a letter at slot 2.  
Valid word: O B R T H → invalid.

Alternative: O T R _ _ → O T R _ _ → O T R ? ? → but we need H somewhere.  
H can’t be here easily.

Another approach: use D.  
D R O U T — H missing.  
D R O W T — H missing.  

Realizing I’m missing a clear candidate, let’s try:  
T H R O W  
- R is slot 3 ✓  
- O is slot 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- T is slot 1 ✓ (allowed)  
- H is slot 2 ✓ (allowed)  
- W is new letter  
This word satisfies everything: THROW  
Letters: T, H, R, O, W  
Excluded letters avoided: A, S, E, N  
Positions:  
- O not in 2 or 3 ✓ (it’s 4)  
- T not in 4 ✓ (it’s 1)  
- H not in 5 ✓ (it’s 2)

So THROW meets all constraints.",Guess 3: throw -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
