For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that will maximize the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, giving me the best chance to identify letters in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are: A, E, S, O, R, I, L, T, N, D. I'll choose a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters.

""AROSE"" is a good choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All these letters appear in many different positions across English words
3. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This will give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are **not** in the word.
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has an O in slot 3.
- It also contains an S somewhere, but not in slot 4.
- It cannot contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
3. Uses other common letters that remain available (T, N, I, L, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like “SOUND”, “SHOCK”, “SLOTH”, but since S must move from slot 4, let’s try a word that puts S at the start and uses other high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Let’s try “SPOON”:
- S is in slot 1 (a new position).
- P is a new common letter.
- Second O is a test to see if there’s another O.
- N is a common consonant.

However, “SPOON” has two O’s and we only know of one; better to avoid duplication until we confirm.

A better pick: “STOCK”
- S in slot 1 (new position)
- T, C, K are all common remaining letters
- Keeps O in slot 3
- No repeats of known letters

So I’ll go with STOCK.

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, giving me the best chance to identify letters in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are: A, E, S, O, R, I, L, T, N, D. I'll choose a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters.

""AROSE"" is a good choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All these letters appear in many different positions across English words
3. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This will give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are **not** in the word.
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has an O in slot 3.
- It also contains an S somewhere, but not in slot 4.
- It cannot contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
3. Uses other common letters that remain available (T, N, I, L, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like “SOUND”, “SHOCK”, “SLOTH”, but since S must move from slot 4, let’s try a word that puts S at the start and uses other high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Let’s try “SPOON”:
- S is in slot 1 (a new position).
- P is a new common letter.
- Second O is a test to see if there’s another O.
- N is a common consonant.

However, “SPOON” has two O’s and we only know of one; better to avoid duplication until we confirm.

A better pick: “STOCK”
- S in slot 1 (new position)
- T, C, K are all common remaining letters
- Keeps O in slot 3
- No repeats of known letters

So I’ll go with STOCK.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)  
   – O is in position 3.  
   – S is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
   – Letters A, R, E are absent.

2. STOCK → S(-) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   – Confirms O in position 3.  
   – S is **not** in position 1.  
   – T, C, K are **not** in the word.

Therefore:
- Must have O in position 3.
- Must contain S somewhere **other than** positions 1 or 4.
- Cannot contain A, R, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already in place).

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.

Candidate words:
- SONIC – but C is excluded.
- SOLID – D is allowed, L and I are allowed, S in 1 is disallowed (rule 2), so invalid.
- FOIST – F is allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- NOISY – N, I, Y are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- MOIST – M, I are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- POSIT – P, I are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- DOING – D, I, N, G are allowed but lacks S.
- USING – U, S, N, I, G are allowed, S in 2 is allowed, positions are valid.

Let’s check USING:
- U in 1 (new, allowed).  
- S in 2 (allowed).

From the latest feedback (FLOPS → F(x) L(x) O(✓) P(x) S(-)) we now know:

- F, L, P are **not** in the word.
- S is in the word but **not** in position 5 (so far we’ve seen S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).  
  Therefore S must be in position 3.
- However, position 3 is **already occupied by O** (from every prior guess).  
  Because a letter cannot simultaneously be O and S in the same slot, this is impossible.

There is an inconsistency: all positions for S have now been eliminated (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 each ruled out), yet the feedback continues to claim S is in the word.  
In a correctly functioning Wordle feedback system this cannot happen.  
The situation implies either:

1. The feedback provided contains an error, or  
2. The puzzle is unsolvable under standard Wordle rules.

Before concluding, let me re-check each prior step:

1. AROSE → O(✓) means O is in position 3 and S is in the word somewhere **other than position 4**.
2. STOCK → S(-) means S is not in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
3. USING → S(-) means S is not in position 2, narrowing S to 3 or 5.
4. FLOPS → S(-) means S is not in position 5, so the **only remaining spot** is position 3.

But position 3 is **already O**.  
Hence no valid placement for S exists, contradicting earlier information.

Conclusion: the feedback sequence is internally inconsistent; no 5-letter target word can satisfy all four pieces of feedback.  
Under normal play, this would indicate a mistake in the feedback given.

Therefore I cannot make a logically valid next guess.  
Nevertheless, if I am forced to choose, I will signal the contradiction by guessing a word that deliberately violates the impossible constraints to highlight the issue.

(Note: In a real game, one would typically ask for correction of the feedback.)
</think>

The sequence of feedback has produced an impossible constraint: every possible position for the letter S has now been ruled out (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are excluded, yet position 3 is already occupied by O). Hence no 5-letter word can satisfy all the feedback provided.

There is an inconsistency: all positions for S have now been eliminated (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 each ruled out), yet the feedback continues to claim S is in the word.  
In a correctly functioning Wordle feedback system this cannot happen.  
The situation implies either:

1. The feedback provided contains an error, or  
2. The puzzle is unsolvable under standard Wordle rules.

Before concluding, let me re-check each prior step:

1. AROSE → O(✓) means O is in position 3 and S is in the word somewhere **other than position 4**.
2. STOCK → S(-) means S is not in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
3. USING → S(-) means S is not in position 2, narrowing S to 3 or 5.
4. FLOPS → S(-) means S is not in position 5, so the **only remaining spot** is position 3.

But position 3 is **already O**.  
Hence no valid placement for S exists, contradicting earlier information.

Conclusion: the feedback sequence is internally inconsistent; no 5-letter target word can satisfy all four pieces of feedback.  
Under normal play, this would indicate a mistake in the feedback given.

Therefore I cannot make a logically valid next guess.  
Nevertheless, if I am forced to choose, I will signal the contradiction by guessing a word that deliberately violates the impossible constraints to highlight the issue.

(Note: In a real game, one would typically ask for correction of the feedback.)The sequence of feedback has produced an impossible constraint: every possible position for the letter S has now been ruled out (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are excluded, yet position 3 is already occupied by O).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BOOST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that will maximize the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, giving me the best chance to identify letters in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are: A, E, S, O, R, I, L, T, N, D. I'll choose a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters.

""AROSE"" is a good choice because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All these letters appear in many different positions across English words
3. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This will give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are **not** in the word.
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has an O in slot 3.
- It also contains an S somewhere, but not in slot 4.
- It cannot contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S in a different position (not 4).
3. Uses other common letters that remain available (T, N, I, L, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like “SOUND”, “SHOCK”, “SLOTH”, but since S must move from slot 4, let’s try a word that puts S at the start and uses other high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Let’s try “SPOON”:
- S is in slot 1 (a new position).
- P is a new common letter.
- Second O is a test to see if there’s another O.
- N is a common consonant.

However, “SPOON” has two O’s and we only know of one; better to avoid duplication until we confirm.

A better pick: “STOCK”
- S in slot 1 (new position)
- T, C, K are all common remaining letters
- Keeps O in slot 3
- No repeats of known letters

So I’ll go with STOCK.

<guess>STOCK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: STOCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)  
   – O is in position 3.  
   – S is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
   – Letters A, R, E are absent.

2. STOCK → S(-) T(-) O(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   – Confirms O in position 3.  
   – S is **not** in position 1.  
   – T, C, K are **not** in the word.

Therefore:
- Must have O in position 3.
- Must contain S somewhere **other than** positions 1 or 4.
- Cannot contain A, R, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already in place).

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.

Candidate words:
- SONIC – but C is excluded.
- SOLID – D is allowed, L and I are allowed, S in 1 is disallowed (rule 2), so invalid.
- FOIST – F is allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- NOISY – N, I, Y are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- MOIST – M, I are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- POSIT – P, I are allowed, S in 4 is disallowed.
- DOING – D, I, N, G are allowed but lacks S.
- USING – U, S, N, I, G are allowed, S in 2 is allowed, positions are valid.

Let’s check USING:
- U in 1 (new, allowed).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- I in 4 (new, allowed).  
- N in 5 (new, allowed).  
- Contains required O in 3.

All constraints satisfied.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback (USING → U(x) S(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)) we learn:

- U, I, N, G are **not** in the word.
- S is in the word but **not** in position 2 (so now we know S must be in position 5 because positions 1 and 4 were already ruled out).
- We already have O locked in position 3.

Known facts:
- O is in position 3.
- S is in position 5.
- Letters that are **not** in the word: A, R, E, T, C, K, U, I, N, G.

Remaining consonants (that haven’t been ruled out): D, L, M, P, B, H, F, Y, W  
Remaining vowel: none left (only O is allowed).  
So slots 1, 2, 4 must be filled with the remaining consonants.

Candidate words fitting _ _ O _ S (O in 3, S in 5) and using only allowed letters:

- DLOPS – L and D allowed, P allowed; but must be a real word.
- FLOPS – F, L, O, P, S – all allowed letters and a real word.
- PLODS – P, L, O, D, S – all allowed letters and a real word.
- BLOWS – B, L, O, W, S – all allowed letters and a real word.

Among these, let’s pick one that uses two fresh common consonants.

FLOPS seems good (F, L, P are all new and common).
