For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about the letters in the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically use common letters distributed across different positions. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRATE
- ADIEU
- STARE

I'll go with ""CRATE"" as it uses C, R, A, T, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback on CRATE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4 but belongs somewhere else).

So the secret word:
- Contains T (but not in slot 4).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

Possible remaining letters: the whole alphabet minus C, R, A, E.

I need a new word that re-uses T in a different position and introduces fresh common letters like S, L, N, I, O, D, etc. A good second-guess mix is often SLING, POINT, or DOILY.

Let’s pick POINT:
- P, O, I, N, T all new and common.
- Puts T in position 5 (not 4), satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

This should quickly narrow down any T possibilities and reveal hits for the new letters.

Letters definitely in the word:  
- O must be in position 2 (✓ every time it is placed there)  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.  
  Possible positions for T: 1 or 4 (position 2 is O, so 2 is excluded).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern looks like:

Case 1: T _ O _ _   (T in 1, O in 2, S must be in 3 or 4)  
Case 2: _ O _ T _   (O in 2, T in 4, S must be in 1 or 3)

Fresh letters still unused: D, G, L, U, Y, B, F, K, W, etc.

I want a word that covers both possible T positions and places S somewhere new, while introducing several fresh letters.

Choosing “STOCK”:
- S in position 1 (tests Case 1 with T in 1 impossible, so this really tests S in 1)  
- T in position 3 (still tests T in a new spot)  
- O in position 2 (locked)  
- C (already eliminated) is in position 4 – but we know C is out. Let me pick a better word.

Better choice: “STOCK” uses C which we know is eliminated. Instead, let’s use “STOUT”:
- S in position 1  
- T in position 3  
- O in position 2 (locked)  
- U and T (but T is already known). Hmm.

Better still: “DOLTS”
- D, L, S fresh  
- O in 2 (locked)  
- T in 4 (tests Case 2)  
- S in 5 – but S can’t be in 5. Oops.

Next candidate: “LOTSY” – Y is fresh and S in 3 (allowed).

But simpler: “LOTSY” isn’t common. Let’s use “LOTSY” but that feels forced.

Actually, a clean test word is “GLOST” but again uncommon.

A standard word that tests: T in 4, O in 2, S in 1: “STOCK” uses C (bad), “STOKE” uses E (bad), “STOGY” uses G, Y.

“STOGY” is acceptable.

But the simplest clean word that tests T in 4, O in 2, S in 1 is “STORY”.

- S in 1  
- T in 4  
- O in 2 ✓  
- R, Y fresh (R is eliminated, so R is a problem). R is eliminated.

Omit R: “STOGY” or “STOLN” – let’s use “STOGY”.

Actually “FOOTS” – O in 2, T in 4, S in 5 (invalid for S).

Finally: “FOLKS” – O in 2, L, K, S fresh, but T missing.

We must include T somewhere new. Let’s go with “GLOST” is uncommon.

Best clean word: “STONY” – S (1), T (2) impossible (O must be 2), so T in 3: “STONY” has T in 3 (invalid, T already shown as not in 3).

Back to basics: Pattern _ O _ _ _

T must be 1 or 4. S must be 3 or 4, but if T is 4, S must be 3.

So possible patterns:

1) T O S _ _   (T in 1, O in 2, S in 3)  
2) _ O S T _   (O in 2, S in 3, T in 4)

Need new letters D, G, L, U, Y, K, etc.

Let’s test pattern 1: T O S _ _

Candidate: TOSYL – invalid (not standard).

Pattern 2: _ O S T _  

Candidate: G O S T _ – but needs 5 letters. GOST_ doesn’t complete.

Another approach: use common word that fits _ O _ T _ with fresh letters.

“BOOST” – O in 2, T in 5 (invalid, T can’t be 5).

“FOIST” – O in 2, T in 5 again.

“WORST” – O in 2, T in 5 again.

Ah, simple: “JOUST” – O in 2, T in 5 invalid.

Actually, the only possible positions now are:

- O is locked in 2.  
- T must be 1 or 4.  
- S must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 and 4 may be T).

So safest word: “TOLUS” – T in 1, O in 2, L, U, S fresh.

Standard word and covers:  
T in 1  
O in 2  
L, U, S fresh letters.

This tests T in 1, O locked, and adds three new letters.

This seems optimal.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BOOST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about the letters in the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically use common letters distributed across different positions. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRATE
- ADIEU
- STARE

I'll go with ""CRATE"" as it uses C, R, A, T, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

<guess>CRATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRATE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4 but belongs somewhere else).

So the secret word:
- Contains T (but not in slot 4).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

Possible remaining letters: the whole alphabet minus C, R, A, E.

I need a new word that re-uses T in a different position and introduces fresh common letters like S, L, N, I, O, D, etc. A good second-guess mix is often SLING, POINT, or DOILY.

Let’s pick POINT:
- P, O, I, N, T all new and common.
- Puts T in position 5 (not 4), satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

This should quickly narrow down any T possibilities and reveal hits for the new letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Letters not in the word (ever): C, R, A, E, P, I, N  
Letters definitely in the word and already placed:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3 or 4.  
  However, position 2 is already taken by O, so T can be in 1, 3, or 4.

So the pattern so far looks like:

_ O _ _ _  with T somewhere in 1, 3, or 4

I need a new word that:
1. Uses O in position 2 (already locked).
2. Uses T in one of those remaining positions (1, 3, 4).
3. Introduces new common letters not yet tested: S, L, D, U, H, G, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate that meets these criteria is “MOTHS”:
- O is already in position 2 (matches ✓).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- M, H, S are fresh letters.

This should tell us where T truly belongs and reveal any hits among M, H, S.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BOOST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about the letters in the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically use common letters distributed across different positions. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRATE
- ADIEU
- STARE

I'll go with ""CRATE"" as it uses C, R, A, T, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

<guess>CRATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRATE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4 but belongs somewhere else).

So the secret word:
- Contains T (but not in slot 4).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.

Possible remaining letters: the whole alphabet minus C, R, A, E.

I need a new word that re-uses T in a different position and introduces fresh common letters like S, L, N, I, O, D, etc. A good second-guess mix is often SLING, POINT, or DOILY.

Let’s pick POINT:
- P, O, I, N, T all new and common.
- Puts T in position 5 (not 4), satisfying the “wrong position” clue.

This should quickly narrow down any T possibilities and reveal hits for the new letters.

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters not in the word (ever): C, R, A, E, P, I, N  
Letters definitely in the word and already placed:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3 or 4.  
  However, position 2 is already taken by O, so T can be in 1, 3, or 4.

So the pattern so far looks like:

_ O _ _ _  with T somewhere in 1, 3, or 4

I need a new word that:
1. Uses O in position 2 (already locked).
2. Uses T in one of those remaining positions (1, 3, 4).
3. Introduces new common letters not yet tested: S, L, D, U, H, G, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate that meets these criteria is “MOTHS”:
- O is already in position 2 (matches ✓).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- M, H, S are fresh letters.

This should tell us where T truly belongs and reveal any hits among M, H, S.

<guess>MOTHS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
Guess 3: MOTHS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) T(-) H(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, N, M, H  
Letters definitely in the word:  
- O must be in position 2 (✓ every time it is placed there)  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.  
  Possible positions for T: 1 or 4 (position 2 is O, so 2 is excluded).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern looks like:

Case 1: T _ O _ _   (T in 1, O in 2, S must be in 3 or 4)  
Case 2: _ O _ T _   (O in 2, T in 4, S must be in 1 or 3)

Fresh letters still unused: D, G, L, U, Y, B, F, K, W, etc.

I want a word that covers both possible T positions and places S somewhere new, while introducing several fresh letters.

Choosing “STOCK”:
- S in position 1 (tests Case 1 with T in 1 impossible, so this really tests S in 1)  
- T in position 3 (still tests T in a new spot)  
- O in position 2 (locked)  
- C (already eliminated) is in position 4 – but we know C is out. Let me pick a better word.

Better choice: “STOCK” uses C which we know is eliminated. Instead, let’s use “STOUT”:
- S in position 1  
- T in position 3  
- O in position 2 (locked)  
- U and T (but T is already known). Hmm.

Better still: “DOLTS”
- D, L, S fresh  
- O in 2 (locked)  
- T in 4 (tests Case 2)  
- S in 5 – but S can’t be in 5. Oops.

Next candidate: “LOTSY” – Y is fresh and S in 3 (allowed).

But simpler: “LOTSY” isn’t common. Let’s use “LOTSY” but that feels forced.

Actually, a clean test word is “GLOST” but again uncommon.

A standard word that tests: T in 4, O in 2, S in 1: “STOCK” uses C (bad), “STOKE” uses E (bad), “STOGY” uses G, Y.

“STOGY” is acceptable.

But the simplest clean word that tests T in 4, O in 2, S in 1 is “STORY”.

- S in 1  
- T in 4  
- O in 2 ✓  
- R, Y fresh (R is eliminated, so R is a problem). R is eliminated.

Omit R: “STOGY” or “STOLN” – let’s use “STOGY”.

Actually “FOOTS” – O in 2, T in 4, S in 5 (invalid for S).

Finally: “FOLKS” – O in 2, L, K, S fresh, but T missing.

We must include T somewhere new. Let’s go with “GLOST” is uncommon.

Best clean word: “STONY” – S (1), T (2) impossible (O must be 2), so T in 3: “STONY” has T in 3 (invalid, T already shown as not in 3).

Back to basics: Pattern _ O _ _ _

T must be 1 or 4. S must be 3 or 4, but if T is 4, S must be 3.

So possible patterns:

1) T O S _ _   (T in 1, O in 2, S in 3)  
2) _ O S T _   (O in 2, S in 3, T in 4)

Need new letters D, G, L, U, Y, K, etc.

Let’s test pattern 1: T O S _ _

Candidate: TOSYL – invalid (not standard).

Pattern 2: _ O S T _  

Candidate: G O S T _ – but needs 5 letters. GOST_ doesn’t complete.

Another approach: use common word that fits _ O _ T _ with fresh letters.

“BOOST” – O in 2, T in 5 (invalid, T can’t be 5).

“FOIST” – O in 2, T in 5 again.

“WORST” – O in 2, T in 5 again.

Ah, simple: “JOUST” – O in 2, T in 5 invalid.

Actually, the only possible positions now are:

- O is locked in 2.  
- T must be 1 or 4.  
- S must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 and 4 may be T).

So safest word: “TOLUS” – T in 1, O in 2, L, U, S fresh.

Standard word and covers:  
T in 1  
O in 2  
L, U, S fresh letters.

This tests T in 1, O locked, and adds three new letters.

This seems optimal.

Current confirmed facts:

- Position 2 is O.  
- T must appear, but has never been accepted in positions 1, 3, 5 → it **must** be in position 4.  
- S must appear, but has never been accepted in positions 1, 3, 5 → it **must** be in position 1.  
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, P, I, N, M, H, L, U, F, Y.  

So the only possible pattern is:

S  O  _  T  _

The missing letter (position 3) must be from the remaining alphabet not yet ruled out:  
B, D, G, K, W, Z (no J, Q, X, V appear in common 5-letter words here).

Valid dictionary words fitting S O _ T _:

1. SOBTS – non-word  
2. SOGTS – non-word  
3. SOKTS – non-word  
4. SOWTS – non-word  
5. SO D T S → **SODTS** non-word  
6. SO B T S → **SOBTS** non-word  

None of these are actual English words.

However, **SO B T S** doesn’t exist; the only common 5-letter word ending OT-S is **SOOTS**, which uses an already-eliminated S again.  

Rechecking: the only standard English 5-letter word that fits **S O _ T _** is **SOOTS**, but that repeats S. Since the rules don’t forbid duplicated letters, **SOOTS** is indeed the only possibility left.

Therefore, the secret word must be **SOOTS**.
