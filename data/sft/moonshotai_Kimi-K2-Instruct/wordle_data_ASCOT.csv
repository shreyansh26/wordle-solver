Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of likely letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:

A(✓) – the first letter is definitely A.  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- First letter: A
- Letters present somewhere: O, S
- Letters excluded: R, E
- Still-unknown positions: 2,3,4,5
- O and S must appear in positions 2,4, or 5 (since they’re not in 3 or 4 respectively).

Good next guesses avoid the excluded letters and place O and S in remaining positions. A high-frequency letter not yet tested is T. A plausible candidate is “ATOMS”:
- It starts with A
- Places O in position 3 (allowed because the earlier feedback only said O is “not in position 3” in AROSE; since AROSE’s O was in position 3, this feedback means O is not in 3 in the secret word). Wait—actually the feedback on AROSE showed O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3. Therefore we must keep O out of position 3.  
Let’s instead try “ABOUT”:
- A at 1 (✓)  
- B is a common untested consonant.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is a new vowel.  
- T is a common untested consonant.  
- It uses the known letter O and doesn’t use R or E.  
- It avoids placing S until we know where S can go without repeating S in position 4.

However, we still need to place S somewhere. A better fit that places both O and S in allowed positions is “AMISS”:
- A(1) ✓  
- M, I, S (S in position 5)  
- O is not used yet. We might still need to place O.

Another candidate that positions O in 2 and S in 5 is “AVISO”:
- A(1) ✓  
- V untested, I untested, S in 4 (but feedback said S is not in 4), so S must be in 2 or 5.  
Let’s put S in 5 and O in 2: “AMONG”
- A, M, O in 2, N, G. But we still need to place S.

A balanced word that fits all constraints is “ABOUT” but it lacks S. A word that has both S and O in new positions is “ASCON” – but N and C are less common.

A more mainstream choice: “APODS” (but P and D are uncommon).

Let’s pick a word that keeps A fixed, uses O and S in new positions, and brings in common new letters. A good candidate is “ABOUT” but it lacks S. Next best: “AFOOT” – but double O is unlikely.

Simplest balanced word: “ABOUT” – even though it lacks S, it checks O in position 2 and tests B, U, T; S can be tested later. However we want to confirm S’s placement.

Best compromise: “ADIOS”
- A(1) ✓  
- D, I new  
- O in 4 (allowed, since earlier O was in 3 and feedback said ‘not in 3’)  
- S in 5 (allowed, since earlier S was in 4 and feedback said ‘not in 4’)

- R and E are definitely out of the word.
- O is now confirmed in position 4 (from ADIOS feedback O(✓)).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from AROSE and ADIOS feedback).  
  – Therefore S must be in position 3.
- Letters still untested that are common and useful: B, C, H, L, M, N, T, U.

Current skeleton: A _ S O _

We need two more letters that are
  – not D, I, R, or E (already ruled out),
  – and may not duplicate A, S, or O.

Common consonants to test: L, N, T, M, C, H, B.

Let’s form a word that fits A _ S O _ and uses high-frequency remaining letters. Good candidates:

- ANSON (but N and S are fine, but ANSON is a proper noun, not a common word)
- ASTON (again, a proper name)
- ASCOT (C and T are common)
- ASHOT (H and T are common)
- ABSOL (not a valid word)

ASCOT is a valid 5-letter word (means necktie) and uses A, S, C, O, T in the exact positions needed:

All letters are allowed and none are duplicates of ruled-out letters.
