Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that uses several of these would be helpful. Some good starting words are:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good initial coverage of the alphabet.

Therefore, the actual word has:
- E in position 4 (fixed).
- R somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since in both guesses R was marked as “in word but wrong position” at positions 2 and 3 respectively).
- No C, A, N, T, I, S.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is already taken by E, so R must be in position 1 or 5.

- Pos 2: ?

- Pos 4: E

- O, G new letters

Another idea: since R can’t be in positions 2 or 3, and must be in 1 or 5, let’s try R in position 5. Then we have _ _ _ E R.

- No C, A, N, T, I, S.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is already taken by E, so R must be in position 1 or 5.

Letters still available (common ones): D, L, O, U, B, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We have the pattern so far:
- Pos 1: R or _ 
- Pos 2: ?
- Pos 3: ?
- Pos 4: E
- Pos 5: R or _ 

Let’s try R in position 1 and choose common letters for positions 2 and 3 that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “ROGER”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O, G new letters
- E in position 4 (matches)
- R in position 5 would be a repeat, but we’re trying R in position 1 here.

But we should avoid double R unless necessary. Let’s instead try “RULER”:
- R in position 1
- U, L new letters
- E in position 4
- R in position 5 would be a repeat.

Another idea: since R can’t be in positions 2 or 3, and must be in 1 or 5, let’s try R in position 5. Then we have _ _ _ E R.

A good word fitting _ _ _ E R is “HOMER”:
- H, O, M new letters
- E in position 4 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This seems optimal.

Known facts
1. E is in position 4.

2. R is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 5 (because in every guess it appeared in one of those spots and was marked “wrong position”).  
   Therefore R **must** be in position 1.

   Word template so far: R _ _ E _

3. Letters **not** in the word at all:

4. Unused common letters that are still possible:  
   B, D, F, G, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Now we need a 5-letter word of the form R _ _ E _ using only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates
- R U L E _  → RULE_ needs a 5th letter; “RULED” uses D, which is allowed.  
- R I D E _  → “RIDER” but I is ruled out.  
- R A K E _  → “RAKER” but A is ruled out.  
- R U P E _  → “RUPER” isn’t a valid word.  
- R U G E _  → “RUGER” isn’t common.  
- R U L E D  → “RULED” is a valid word, uses only allowed letters.

Check RULED:
- R in pos 1 (required)  
- U and L are still allowed  
- E in pos 4 (required)  
- D is still allowed  

Therefore RULED is a valid next guess that satisfies every constraint.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that uses several of these would be helpful. Some good starting words are:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- RAISE

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good initial coverage of the alphabet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: NOT in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- A: NOT in the word (x)
- N: NOT in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but R is NOT in position 2 and E is NOT in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Good letters to focus on next: R, E, plus other common letters not yet tested like T, S, L, I, O.

Looking for a new 5-letter word using these constraints:
- Must include R and E
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5
- Cannot use C, A, N

A strong candidate is ""STERE"":
- S, T (new common letters)
- E (known to be in word)
- R (known to be in word)
- E again (double letter possible, plus tests E in position 5 - but we know E isn't in 5th spot from feedback, so maybe better to avoid)

Better choice: ""TRIES"":
- T, I (new common letters)
- R and E (known to be in word)
- S (new common letter)
- R is in position 3 (allowed since it can't be in position 2)
- E is in position 4 (allowed since it can't be in position 5)

This tests T, I, S while keeping R and E in new positions.

From the latest feedback (RULED):

1. R(✓) – R is correctly in position 1.
2. U(x) – U is not in the word.
3. L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
4. E(✓) – E is correctly in position 4.
5. D(x) – D is not in the word.

Current template: R _ _ E _

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, S, H, O, M, U, D  
Letters still unused but allowed: B, F, G, K, P, W, Y, etc.

We also know L is in the word but must occupy either position 2 or 5 (since positions 1, 3, 4 are taken by R, _, E respectively).

Possible positions for L:
- Position 2: R L _ E _
- Position 5: R _ _ E L

Let’s test position 5 first (R _ _ E L) because position 2 would leave fewer common consonants for position 5.

Valid words of the form R _ _ E L:
- R A G E L → “RAGEL” not valid
- R I G E L → “RIGEL” but I is ruled out
- R U G E L → U is ruled out
- R O G E L → O is ruled out
- R B E E L → “REBEL” → valid, but E is already in position 4 and double E is possible. However, “REBEL” would be _ E B E L, doesn’t fit R _ _ E L.
- R F E E L → invalid
- R G E E L → invalid
- R P E E L → invalid
- R W E E L → invalid
- R G Y E L → invalid

Wait, let me think of actual valid 5-letter words with pattern R _ _ E L:
- R I P E L – invalid
- R A P E L – invalid
- R U P E L – invalid
- R O P E L – invalid
- R A G E L – invalid
- R U G E L – invalid
- R I G E L – invalid
- R U N E L – invalid
- R U S E L – invalid

Hmm, seems like no common valid English words fit R _ _ E L except “RUBEL” (but U is ruled out), “RAVEL” (A and V not yet considered)

Wait, “RAVEL”:
- R A V E L → A is ruled out (from CRANE feedback)
  
“REBEL”:
- R E B E L → E is in position 4, so this would be R E B E L. But E is already in position 4, so position 2 would be E, which is allowed. However, this would be R E B E L – but we don’t know if second E is allowed (double E possible). But “REBEL” is a valid word.

Let me check “REBEL”:
- R(✓), E in position 2 (unknown), B, E(✓), L(-)
But from feedback, L is in word, and in REBEL, L is in position 5 which is allowed.

But we need to check if B is allowed. B hasn’t been tested yet.

Alternative: position 2 for L (R L _ E _):
Need a word R L _ E _ with remaining letters allowed (not C,A,N,T,I,S,H,O,M,U,D).

Possible:
- R L B E _ → “RLBEE” invalid
- R L G E _ → “RLGEE” invalid
- R L F E _ → “RLFEE” invalid
- R L P E _ → “RLPEE” invalid
- R L Y E _ → “RLYEE” invalid

Real valid words:
- R L A C E → invalid (A, C ruled out)
- R L I C E → invalid (I, C)
- R L O S E → invalid (O, S)
- R L O P E → invalid (O, P not ruled out but O is ruled out)
- R L U S E → invalid (U, S)
- R L A M E → invalid (A, M)
- R L A T E → invalid (A, T)
- R L A Z E → invalid (A, Z)
- R L O G E → invalid (O)

Seems no valid words fit R L _ E _ with current constraints.

Thus, the only plausible word left is “REBEL” (R E B E L), even though it has two Es. The rules don’t forbid double letters.

So the next guess is REBEL.
