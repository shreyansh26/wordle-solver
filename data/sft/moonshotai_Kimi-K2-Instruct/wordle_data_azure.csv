Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting hits or useful information. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word should cover multiple common letters. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). However, another strong option is ""CRANE"" which has C, R, A, N, E - also covering many frequent letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's widely considered an optimal starting word in Wordle-like games.

- AROMA – O is excluded.
- ANGER – A N G E R; R is in 5th, but E is already confirmed for 5th, so this would need R in 4th and something else in 5th – doesn’t fit.

From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
   - Contains R (but not in position 2)
   - Letters NOT in the word: O, S

2. AGREE → A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
   - Still A _ _ _ E
   - G is NOT in the word
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the updated constraints:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ E
- R must appear in position 4 (positions 2 and 3 are already ruled out)
- Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, G
- No restriction yet on positions 2 and 3 other than they can’t be the excluded letters.

Therefore the word must be A _ R _ E.

Viable 5-letter words that fit A _ R _ E:
- ARARE — not common
- AERIE — contains E twice, but E is already in position 5 (could be, but “AERIE” has E in position 2 and 4; position 4 is R here)
- ANIME — N and M are possible
- ARISE — S excluded
- ARBOR — B and O; O excluded
- ARGUE — G excluded
- ACREE — but real word is “ACRE”
- AIRIE — uncommon

A common word fitting: A R I _ E, but we need to check the exact pattern: A _ R _ E.

Look at:

- AERIE (A-E-R-I-E) — has E in position 2, which is not yet forbidden
- ANIME (A-N-I-M-E) — but R is required in position 4

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current feedback from AROSE:
- A(✓) — 1st letter is A
- R(-) — R is in the word but NOT in 2nd position
- O(x) — O is NOT in the word
- S(x) — S is NOT in the word
- E(✓) — 5th letter is E

So far we know:
1. A _ _ _ E
2. Contains R (but not in 2nd position)
3. Does NOT contain O, S

We need a 5-letter word matching A _ _ _ E that includes R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since 2nd position is ruled out) and avoids O and S.

Possible candidates that fit:
- ARISE – but S is excluded.
- AGREE – fits: A G R E E (E in 5th is already known); R is in 3rd position.
- AROMA – O is excluded.
- ANGER – A N G E R; R is in 5th, but E is already confirmed for 5th, so this would need R in 4th and something else in 5th – doesn’t fit.
- AUGER – A U G E R – R is in 5th but E is already 5th.

Looking at patterns, ""AGREE"" fits all constraints: starts with A, ends with E, contains R in a valid position (3rd), and avoids O and S.

Let’s try AGREE.

<guess>AGREE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
   - Contains R (but not in position 2)
   - Letters NOT in the word: O, S

2. AGREE → A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
   - Still A _ _ _ E
   - G is NOT in the word
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the updated constraints:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ E
- R must appear in position 4 (positions 2 and 3 are already ruled out)
- Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, G
- No restriction yet on positions 2 and 3 other than they can’t be the excluded letters.

Therefore the word must be A _ R _ E.

Viable 5-letter words that fit A _ R _ E:
- ARARE — not common
- AERIE — contains E twice, but E is already in position 5 (could be, but “AERIE” has E in position 2 and 4; position 4 is R here)
- ANIME — N and M are possible
- ARISE — S excluded
- ARBOR — B and O; O excluded
- ARGUE — G excluded
- ACREE — but real word is “ACRE”
- AIRIE — uncommon

A common word fitting: A R I _ E, but we need to check the exact pattern: A _ R _ E.

Look at:
- ARARE (A-R-A-R-E) — possible, but rare
- AERIE (A-E-R-I-E) — has E in position 2, which is not yet forbidden
- ANIME (A-N-I-M-E) — but R is required in position 4
- APHRE — not a word
- AFIRE (A-F-I-R-E) — fits A _ _ R E exactly: A F I R E

Wait – we have A _ _ R E. Let’s systematically list valid English 5-letter words that start with A and end with RE, excluding any that contain the banned letters.

Banned letters: O, S, G, F, I

Known pattern: A _ _ R E

Real words:
- ACREE – invalid (ACRE is 4 letters)
- AMBER – A M B E R – fits A _ _ R E? No, it’s A M B E R (positions 1-5). Actually, it’s A M B E R – position 4 is B, not R. Doesn’t fit.
- ANGER – G excluded

- AWARE – W allowed, no banned letters: A W A R E – pattern A _ A R E – fits A _ _ R E (position 3 is A)
  - Check letters: A, W, A, R, E – none of the banned letters. This is a valid word and meets all constraints.

So AWARE is a perfect fit:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,azure,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting hits or useful information. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good starting word should cover multiple common letters. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). However, another strong option is ""CRANE"" which has C, R, A, N, E - also covering many frequent letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's widely considered an optimal starting word in Wordle-like games.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current feedback from AROSE:
- A(✓) — 1st letter is A
- R(-) — R is in the word but NOT in 2nd position
- O(x) — O is NOT in the word
- S(x) — S is NOT in the word
- E(✓) — 5th letter is E

So far we know:
1. A _ _ _ E
2. Contains R (but not in 2nd position)
3. Does NOT contain O, S

We need a 5-letter word matching A _ _ _ E that includes R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since 2nd position is ruled out) and avoids O and S.

Possible candidates that fit:
- ARISE – but S is excluded.
- AGREE – fits: A G R E E (E in 5th is already known); R is in 3rd position.
- AROMA – O is excluded.
- ANGER – A N G E R; R is in 5th, but E is already confirmed for 5th, so this would need R in 4th and something else in 5th – doesn’t fit.
- AUGER – A U G E R – R is in 5th but E is already 5th.

Looking at patterns, ""AGREE"" fits all constraints: starts with A, ends with E, contains R in a valid position (3rd), and avoids O and S.

Let’s try AGREE.

<guess>AGREE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AGREE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
   - Contains R (but not in position 2)
   - Letters NOT in the word: O, S

2. AGREE → A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
   - Still A _ _ _ E
   - G is NOT in the word
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the updated constraints:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ E
- R must appear in position 4 (positions 2 and 3 are already ruled out)
- Letters that are NOT in the secret word: O, S, G
- No restriction yet on positions 2 and 3 other than they can’t be the excluded letters.

Therefore the word must be A _ R _ E.

Viable 5-letter words that fit A _ R _ E:
- ARARE — not common
- AERIE — contains E twice, but E is already in position 5 (could be, but “AERIE” has E in position 2 and 4; position 4 is R here)
- ANIME — N and M are possible
- ARISE — S excluded
- ARBOR — B and O; O excluded
- ARGUE — G excluded
- ACREE — but real word is “ACRE”
- AIRIE — uncommon

A common word fitting: A R I _ E, but we need to check the exact pattern: A _ R _ E.

Look at:
- ARARE (A-R-A-R-E) — possible, but rare
- AERIE (A-E-R-I-E) — has E in position 2, which is not yet forbidden
- ANIME (A-N-I-M-E) — but R is required in position 4
- APHRE — not a word
- AFIRE (A-F-I-R-E) — fits A _ _ R E exactly: A F I R E

Let me check: AFIRE
- A(✓) F I R E — position 4 is R, position 5 is E, no O/S/G, meets all constraints.

2. Letters NOT in word: O, S, G, F, I
3. R is in position 4 and is ✓, so fixed.
4. A and E are fixed at positions 1 and 5.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A _ _ R E, using only letters not yet excluded.

Excluded letters: O, S, G, F, I
Allowed consonants left (in rough frequency order): T, N, L, C, B, D, M, H, P, Y, etc.

Try each consonant in positions 2 and 3 (must both be allowed and form a real word):

- A T _ R E: AT...RE – no common word
- A N _ R E: AN...RE – ANGER (but G is excluded), ANODE (O excluded), ANKLE (K allowed) – ANKLE? No, it’s A N K L E, doesn’t fit.
- A C _ R E: A C _ R E – ACRRE – no
- A L _ R E: A L _ R E – AL...RE – ALURE? Not common
- A B _ R E: A B _ R E – AB...RE – ABORE (O excluded)
- A M _ R E: AM...RE – no
- A D _ R E: AD...RE – ADORE (O excluded)
- A T C R E – not a word
- A B U R E – no
- A M B R E – no
- A N C R E – ANCRE (rare, but not valid)
- A T L R E – no
- A N T R E – ANTRE (rare)
- A C T R E – no
- A B R R E – no
- A C H R E – no

Wait – we have A _ _ R E. Let’s systematically list valid English 5-letter words that start with A and end with RE, excluding any that contain the banned letters.

Banned letters: O, S, G, F, I

Known pattern: A _ _ R E

Real words:
- ACREE – invalid (ACRE is 4 letters)
- AMBER – A M B E R – fits A _ _ R E? No, it’s A M B E R (positions 1-5). Actually, it’s A M B E R – position 4 is B, not R. Doesn’t fit.
- ANGER – G excluded
- ANKLE – K and L, but pattern is A N K L E – doesn’t match A _ _ R E
- AWARE – W allowed, no banned letters: A W A R E – pattern A _ A R E – fits A _ _ R E (position 3 is A)
  - Check letters: A, W, A, R, E – none of the banned letters. This is a valid word and meets all constraints.

So AWARE is a perfect fit:
- A(1) ✓
- W (allowed)
- A (allowed) in position 3
- R(4) ✓
- E(5) ✓

No banned letters present and all positional constraints met.

Current constraints after five guesses:

1. Pattern locked: A _ _ R E  (positions 1, 4, 5 are A, R, E)
2. Letters **not** in the word: O, S, G, F, I, W, N, T
3. Letters **not** in positions 2 or 3:  
   - A (cannot be in position 3 – cf. AWARE feedback)
   - E (cannot be in position 4 – cf. AGREE feedback)
   - R (cannot be in positions 2 or 3 – cf. AGREE & AROSE feedback)

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 3, taken from the remaining alphabet and excluding the banned set:
- Remaining consonants: B, C, D, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O, I are already ruled out)

We need a real 5-letter word of the form A _ _ R E using only those letters.  
The two slots to fill are positions 2 and 3.  Try all consonant + allowed-letter pairs:

A B C R E → ABCRE – no  
A B D R E → ABDRE – no  
A C H R E – ACHRE – no  
A C R E E – no  
A D M R E – no  
A L B R E – ALBRE – no  
A L V R E – ALVRE – no  
A M B R E – AMBRE (a real word: “ambre” is an archaic variant of amber).

Check: A M B R E  
- All letters are allowed (M, B not yet banned).  
- No banned letters (O, S, G, F, I, W, N, T) appear.  
- Pattern fits A _ _ R E perfectly.

Hence “AMBRE” is the only remaining plausible candidate.
