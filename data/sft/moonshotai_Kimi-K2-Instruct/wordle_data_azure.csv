For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, O, N, S, L, C. One effective approach is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some popular strong starter words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)

This should help quickly identify which letters are present/absent in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses:

   - R (from both guesses we know it is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5; therefore R must be in position 1 or 3)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the secret word  
   - C, N, W, T

3. Positional constraints  
   - Position 5 is E (from guess 1 feedback)  
   - A is not in positions 2 or 3  
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. Only possible in 1 or 3.

- Ends with E  
- Contains both A and R  
- Has A not in positions 2 or 3  
- Has R in position 1 or 3  
- Contains none of C, N, W, T

Alternative: put R in position 3. Then word looks like _ _ R _ E.  
A must be in position 1 or 4. Position 4 is taken by E, so A must be in position 1.  
Word pattern: A _ R _ E.  
Fill middle letters avoiding C, N, W, T.  
We can use A L R I E – but ALRIE is invalid.  
A I R E _ – needs one more letter.  
A M I R E – not a word.  
A G R E E – this is valid!

1. Letters that are IN the word, and their positions  
   - A is in position 1 (from AGREE feedback)  
   - E is in position 5 (from CRANE feedback)  

2. Letters in the word but in the wrong positions

   - R (from AGREE) – not in position 3  
   - Therefore R must be in position 4 (positions 1 and 5 are already taken by A and E).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   C, N, W, T, G

Current pattern:  
A _ _ R E and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, N, W, T, G).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, such that the combination makes a valid English word.

Examples to test quickly:
- ABIDE – but D and I are allowed, but B is allowed, but ABIDE has I in position 3 and that’s fine.  
- ADORE – D and O are allowed.  
- ALERT – but T is not allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, O, N, S, L, C. One effective approach is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some popular strong starter words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)

This should help quickly identify which letters are present/absent in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

C – not in the word  
R – in the word, but not in position 2  
A – in the word, but not in position 3  
N – not in the word  
E – in the word and in the correct position (position 5)  

So the secret word ends with E, contains R and A (but R is not in slot 2 and A is not in slot 3), and does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
- ends in E
- contains R and A
- does not have C or N
- R cannot be in slot 2
- A cannot be in slot 3

Good candidates: LATER, MATER, RATER, WATER, TAPER, PAPER, BAKER, GAMER…

Let’s pick “WATER”; it satisfies all constraints:
- ends in E
- has A (not in slot 3) and R (not in slot 2)
- no C or N

1. Letters definitely in the secret word  
   - E (it is in the word, and from the first guess we know it is in the 5th position)
   - A (from the first guess we know it is not in position 3, from the second guess we see it is in the word but not in position 2 either)
   - R (from both guesses we know it is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5; therefore R must be in position 1 or 3)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the secret word  
   - C, N, W, T

3. Positional constraints  
   - Position 5 is E (from guess 1 feedback)  
   - A is not in positions 2 or 3  
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. Only possible in 1 or 3.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E  
- Contains both A and R  
- Has A not in positions 2 or 3  
- Has R in position 1 or 3  
- Contains none of C, N, W, T

Looking at these constraints, place R in position 1 and A in position 4 seems to satisfy all.  
Candidate: R A _ _ E but A can’t be in position 3 so try R _ A _ E.  
Let’s pick R A P E _ → R A P E ?. Need a fifth letter that isn’t C, N, W, T and makes a valid word.  
“RAPE” is only 4 letters. Try “RAISE” – but it has S and E – S is allowed.

- R in position 1 ✓  
- A in position 2 – but earlier feedback tells us A cannot be in position 2. So RAISE is invalid.

Next candidate: R _ _ A E with A in position 4.  
We need letters in positions 2 and 3 that are not C, N, W, T and form a valid word.  
Try R O A D E → invalid (D is fine, but ROADE is not a word).

Try R A M I E – but A is in position 2 again (invalid).  
Try F A R E D – but E must be last.  
Try B R A V E – but R in position 2 is invalid.

Alternative: put R in position 3. Then word looks like _ _ R _ E.  
A must be in position 1 or 4. Position 4 is taken by E, so A must be in position 1.  
Word pattern: A _ R _ E.  
Fill middle letters avoiding C, N, W, T.  
We can use A L R I E – but ALRIE is invalid.  
A I R E _ – needs one more letter.

From all feedback:

Known fixed letters:
- Position 1: A (from AGREE and AIDER)
- Position 5: E (from CRANE)

Known letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- R appeared in CRANE, WATER, AGREE, and AIDER always as “-” (wrong position).  
  - Forbidden positions for R: 2 (CRANE), 3 (AGREE), 4 (AIDER).  
  - Positions 1 and 5 are already taken by A and E, so the only remaining spot is position 3.  
  Therefore R must be in position 3.

Letters definitely absent: C, N, W, T, G, I, D.

So we have the pattern: A _ R _ E

We need to choose a letter for position 2 and 4 from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden set). Allowed letters include B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, etc.

Looking for common words:
- AFIRE  (but I is excluded)  
- AFORE  (O and F are allowed)  
- AMBER  (M and B are allowed)  
- ARBOR  (repeats R)  
- ARGUE  (G and U are allowed, but G is already excluded)  
- AROSE  (O and S are allowed)

“AFORE” fits: A F O R E
- A in pos 1 ✓  
- F and O not in excluded list ✓  
- R in pos 3 ✓  
- E in pos 5 ✓

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, O, N, S, L, C. One effective approach is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some popular strong starter words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)

This should help quickly identify which letters are present/absent in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

C – not in the word  
R – in the word, but not in position 2  
A – in the word, but not in position 3  
N – not in the word  
E – in the word and in the correct position (position 5)  

So the secret word ends with E, contains R and A (but R is not in slot 2 and A is not in slot 3), and does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
- ends in E
- contains R and A
- does not have C or N
- R cannot be in slot 2
- A cannot be in slot 3

Good candidates: LATER, MATER, RATER, WATER, TAPER, PAPER, BAKER, GAMER…

Let’s pick “WATER”; it satisfies all constraints:
- ends in E
- has A (not in slot 3) and R (not in slot 2)
- no C or N

Guess 2: WATER -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(-) T(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses:

1. Letters definitely in the secret word  
   - E (it is in the word, and from the first guess we know it is in the 5th position)
   - A (from the first guess we know it is not in position 3, from the second guess we see it is in the word but not in position 2 either)
   - R (from both guesses we know it is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5; therefore R must be in position 1 or 3)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the secret word  
   - C, N, W, T

3. Positional constraints  
   - Position 5 is E (from guess 1 feedback)  
   - A is not in positions 2 or 3  
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. Only possible in 1 or 3.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E  
- Contains both A and R  
- Has A not in positions 2 or 3  
- Has R in position 1 or 3  
- Contains none of C, N, W, T

Looking at these constraints, place R in position 1 and A in position 4 seems to satisfy all.  
Candidate: R A _ _ E but A can’t be in position 3 so try R _ A _ E.  
Let’s pick R A P E _ → R A P E ?. Need a fifth letter that isn’t C, N, W, T and makes a valid word.  
“RAPE” is only 4 letters. Try “RAISE” – but it has S and E – S is allowed.  
Check constraints:
- R in position 1 ✓  
- A in position 2 – but earlier feedback tells us A cannot be in position 2. So RAISE is invalid.

Next candidate: R _ _ A E with A in position 4.  
We need letters in positions 2 and 3 that are not C, N, W, T and form a valid word.  
Try R O A D E → invalid (D is fine, but ROADE is not a word).  
Try R I A L E → RIALE not a word.  
Try R A M I E – but A is in position 2 again (invalid).  
Try F A R E D – but E must be last.  
Try B R A V E – but R in position 2 is invalid.

Alternative: put R in position 3. Then word looks like _ _ R _ E.  
A must be in position 1 or 4. Position 4 is taken by E, so A must be in position 1.  
Word pattern: A _ R _ E.  
Fill middle letters avoiding C, N, W, T.  
We can use A L R I E – but ALRIE is invalid.  
A I R E _ – needs one more letter.  
A M I R E – not a word.  
A G R E E – this is valid!  
Check constraints:  
- A is in position 1 (allowed)  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- E is in position 5 (required)  
- No C, N, W, T  
- Contains both A and R  
“AGREE” fits all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list everything we now know.

1. Letters that are IN the word, and their positions  
   - A is in position 1 (from AGREE feedback)  
   - E is in position 5 (from CRANE feedback)  

2. Letters in the word but in the wrong positions  
   - R (from CRANE) – not in position 2  
   - R (from AGREE) – not in position 3  
   - Therefore R must be in position 4 (positions 1 and 5 are already taken by A and E).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   C, N, W, T, G

Current pattern:  
A _ _ R E and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, N, W, T, G).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, such that the combination makes a valid English word.

Examples to test quickly:
- ABIDE – but D and I are allowed, but B is allowed, but ABIDE has I in position 3 and that’s fine.  
- ADORE – D and O are allowed.  
- ALERT – but T is not allowed.  
- AMBER – M and B are allowed.  
- ANGER – N and G not allowed.  
- AIDER – I and D are allowed.

Let’s pick “AIDER” – it fits A _ I _ R _ E.  
Check constraints:  
- A in 1 ✓  
- I and D are not in the excluded list ✓  
- R in 4 ✓  
- E in 5 ✓  
- No C, N, W, T, G ✓

- E is correctly in position 5
- F and O are NOT in the word at all

So the actual pattern is: A _ _ R E with the blanks being positions 2 and 3.

Wait no - let me clarify the positions from the feedback:

AFORE:
A - position 1 (✓)
F - position 2 (x) - not in word
O - position 3 (x) - not in word
R - position 4 (✓)
E - position 5 (✓)

So the word structure is: A _ _ R E with positions 2 and 3 needing letters, and the following letters are excluded:
C, N, W, T, G, I, D, F, O

Remaining letters: B, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit A _ _ R E with these constraints:

Possible words:
- AMBER (M and B are allowed)
- ASKER (S and K are allowed)
- ALDER (D is excluded)
- AKERS (not a word)
- APERS (P and E again, but P is allowed)
- AUGER (U and G, but G is excluded)
- AYMER (not a word)

Between AMBER and ASKER, both fit. Let me check:
- AMBER: A(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - but position 4 is R, not E. Wait, no - the structure is A _ _ R E, so:
- A _ _ R E means positions 2,3,4,5 are _, _, R, E - no, that's not right.

Actually, from AFORE feedback:
- A is correct in position 1
- R is correct in position 4
- E is correct in position 5

So the pattern is: A _ _ R E with positions 2 and 3 to be filled, and the letters not being any of the excluded ones.

Looking at this, the word must be A _ _ R E with positions 2 and 3 filled from remaining letters.

Looking at possible combinations:
- A + B + ? + R + E → A B _ R E → ABARE (not a word)
- A + L + ? + R + E → A L _ R E → ALURE (not common)
- A + M + B + R + E → A M B R E → AMBER (valid word)

AMBER fits perfectly:
A(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), E(5)
All letters are from allowed set, and it matches the pattern.

<guess>AMBER</guess>",AMBER,"We have:

A _ _ R E with:
- Position 1: A (confirmed)
- Position 3: R (confirmed)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)
- Letters excluded so far: C, N, W, T, G, I, D, F, O

We now need to find the missing letter for position 2 and 4, but looking at the pattern A _ R _ E, we actually have the structure A _ R _ E, which means:

- Position 2 needs a letter (not in excluded list)
- Position 4 is already filled by R

Wait, let me re-express this correctly: the pattern is A _ R _ E, meaning:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: E

But from AFORE feedback, we know:
- A(✓) F(x) O(x) R(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- A is correctly in position 1
- R is correctly in position 4
- E is correctly in position 5
- F and O are NOT in the word at all

So the actual pattern is: A _ _ R E with the blanks being positions 2 and 3.
