For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by testing common letters and letter positions. The optimal opening word should include frequently used letters in English while avoiding uncommon letters or letter combinations. 

Popular choices like ""ADIEU"" or ""AUDIO"" focus on vowels, but consonants like S, T, R, N, and L are also very common. A balanced approach that tests both vowels and common consonants in good positions is ideal.

After considering several options, ""SLATE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because:
1. It includes three of the most common consonants (S, T, L) in good positions
2. It has two common vowels (A, E)
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain
4. It's a common, valid English word

Other strong candidates like ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good, but ""SLATE"" provides a nice balance of common letters and positions.

We now know the exact pattern: S _ A L D.

Positions fixed:
1: S
3: A
4: L
5: D

Only position 2 is unknown, and it must form a valid 5-letter word with the known letters.  
Letters already ruled out (from all feedback): T, E, N, R, K.  
Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U  

Possible candidates that fit S _ A L D:
- SCALD – uses C (already tested? No, C hasn’t been used yet)  
- SHALD – not a valid word  
- SMALD – archaic/minor variant, unlikely  
- SPALD – not a common word  
- SWALD – not valid  

The only common, valid word is **SCALD** – but we already guessed SKALD and D was marked ✓ at position 5, so SCALD is essentially the same pattern (S C A L D). The issue is that C was never explicitly tested, and the game might accept SCALD as a distinct guess. However, since the pattern is locked to S _ A L D, the only remaining letter to test is position 2.

Given the constraints, **SC** is the most plausible start for the blank.

Thus the missing letter is C.
