For the first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. Good first guesses often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain

Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong first choice.

From the feedback for AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in slot 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.

Therefore the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
2. DOES contain the letter A somewhere other than the first position (positions 2-5).
3. Still needs three more letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, S, E).

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O & E are out).

A good second guess uses many of these still-possible letters and places A in positions 2-5. The word “TAINT” would test several new letters (T, I, N) and places A in position 2. However, I prefer “PLAIN” because it:
- P, L, I, N are all still possible.
- Places A in position 3.

Let’s lock that in.

- A ≠ 1st, 3rd
- N ≠ 5th

We still need three more distinct letters drawn from the unused alphabet, excluding the 7 letters already ruled out.  Common remaining consonants: T, C, D, B, G, M, K, F, H, etc.; remaining vowels: U (since A is already in, and O, E, I are out).

We want a 5-letter word that uses:
- A (not 1st or 3rd)
- N (not 5th)
- three other unused letters.

One convenient pattern: N _ A _ _ or _ N _ A _ or _ A N _ _ etc.

Let’s try “CHANT”:
- C, H, T have not been tried yet
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A is NOT in position 3!).

Try “UNMAN”:
- U, M are new letters, N in 1st, A in 4th, N again in 5th – but N cannot be 5th.  
Also duplicates N, which is allowed only if the secret word contains two N’s (unlikely without evidence).

Try “URBAN”:
- U, B, R: R already excluded.

- A is 3rd again (invalid).

Try “TUBAN”:
- A is 4th (acceptable), N is 5th (invalid).

From the new feedback on CANDY we now have exact placements:

A is in position 2 (✓)  
N is in position 3 (✓)  
Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the unknown letters are in positions 1 and 4, and must be drawn from the remaining pool that excludes:
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, C, D

Available letters (excluding the above and excluding A, N, Y which are already placed):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

- FANCY – C is excluded
- MANGY – M and G, and MANGY is a valid word
- HANKY – H and K, and HANKY is valid
- TANGY – T and G, TANGY is valid
- VANNY – repeats N (not necessary)
- BANTY – T is fine, but BANTY is uncommon
- WANKY – W and K, but WANKY is slang and might not be in the allowed list

The clearest valid choices among these are MANGY, HANKY, TANGY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Good first guesses often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain

Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong first choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in slot 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.

Therefore the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
2. DOES contain the letter A somewhere other than the first position (positions 2-5).
3. Still needs three more letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, S, E).

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O & E are out).

A good second guess uses many of these still-possible letters and places A in positions 2-5. The word “TAINT” would test several new letters (T, I, N) and places A in position 2. However, I prefer “PLAIN” because it:
- P, L, I, N are all still possible.
- Places A in position 3.

Let’s lock that in.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

Letters absent entirely: R, O, S, E, P, L, I
Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, N
Positions where these letters are NOT:
- A ≠ 1st, 3rd
- N ≠ 5th

Remaining positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Remaining positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4

We still need three more distinct letters drawn from the unused alphabet, excluding the 7 letters already ruled out.  Common remaining consonants: T, C, D, B, G, M, K, F, H, etc.; remaining vowels: U (since A is already in, and O, E, I are out).

We want a 5-letter word that uses:
- A (not 1st or 3rd)
- N (not 5th)
- three other unused letters.

One convenient pattern: N _ A _ _ or _ N _ A _ or _ A N _ _ etc.

Let’s try “CHANT”:
- C, H, T have not been tried yet
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A is NOT in position 3!).  
So CHANT is invalid because A cannot be 3rd.

Next try “NAVAL”:
- V and L: L is already excluded (x in PLAIN), so skip.

Try “UNMAN”:
- U, M are new letters, N in 1st, A in 4th, N again in 5th – but N cannot be 5th.  
Also duplicates N, which is allowed only if the secret word contains two N’s (unlikely without evidence).

Try “URBAN”:
- U, B, R: R already excluded.

Try “CAULK”:
- A is 3rd again (invalid).

Try “TUBAN”:
- A is 4th (acceptable), N is 5th (invalid).

Try “GNAT” – only 4 letters.

Try “VANDA” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Try “MANIA” – I is excluded, A appears twice but 3rd is invalid.

Try “BANAL” – L excluded.

Try “ANKLE” – L, E excluded.

Try “ADHAN” – A is 2nd, D, H new letters, N is 5th (invalid).

Try “ADMAN” – same issue with N 5th.

Try “GAMMA” – A is 3rd, M appears twice with no evidence.

Try “ADUNC” – obscure.

Try “CANDY” – A 2nd, N 3rd, C, D, Y new – all letters unused so far and positions obey constraints.

Let’s check:
C A N D Y
- C, D, Y never tested – OK
- A is 2nd (allowed)
- N is 3rd (allowed)
- No excluded letters
- All five letters distinct
- Word exists in English.

This looks valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. Good first guesses often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain

Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong first choice.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s NOT in slot 1).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters are NOT in the secret word at all.

Therefore the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
2. DOES contain the letter A somewhere other than the first position (positions 2-5).
3. Still needs three more letters drawn from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, S, E).

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O & E are out).

A good second guess uses many of these still-possible letters and places A in positions 2-5. The word “TAINT” would test several new letters (T, I, N) and places A in position 2. However, I prefer “PLAIN” because it:
- P, L, I, N are all still possible.
- Places A in position 3.

Let’s lock that in.

<guess>PLAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

Letters absent entirely: R, O, S, E, P, L, I
Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, N
Positions where these letters are NOT:
- A ≠ 1st, 3rd
- N ≠ 5th

Remaining positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Remaining positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4

We still need three more distinct letters drawn from the unused alphabet, excluding the 7 letters already ruled out.  Common remaining consonants: T, C, D, B, G, M, K, F, H, etc.; remaining vowels: U (since A is already in, and O, E, I are out).

We want a 5-letter word that uses:
- A (not 1st or 3rd)
- N (not 5th)
- three other unused letters.

One convenient pattern: N _ A _ _ or _ N _ A _ or _ A N _ _ etc.

Let’s try “CHANT”:
- C, H, T have not been tried yet
- A is in position 3 (but we already know A is NOT in position 3!).  
So CHANT is invalid because A cannot be 3rd.

Next try “NAVAL”:
- V and L: L is already excluded (x in PLAIN), so skip.

Try “UNMAN”:
- U, M are new letters, N in 1st, A in 4th, N again in 5th – but N cannot be 5th.  
Also duplicates N, which is allowed only if the secret word contains two N’s (unlikely without evidence).

Try “URBAN”:
- U, B, R: R already excluded.

Try “CAULK”:
- A is 3rd again (invalid).

Try “TUBAN”:
- A is 4th (acceptable), N is 5th (invalid).

Try “GNAT” – only 4 letters.

Try “VANDA” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Try “MANIA” – I is excluded, A appears twice but 3rd is invalid.

Try “BANAL” – L excluded.

Try “ANKLE” – L, E excluded.

Try “ADHAN” – A is 2nd, D, H new letters, N is 5th (invalid).

Try “ADMAN” – same issue with N 5th.

Try “GAMMA” – A is 3rd, M appears twice with no evidence.

Try “ADUNC” – obscure.

Try “CANDY” – A 2nd, N 3rd, C, D, Y new – all letters unused so far and positions obey constraints.

Let’s check:
C A N D Y
- C, D, Y never tested – OK
- A is 2nd (allowed)
- N is 3rd (allowed)
- No excluded letters
- All five letters distinct
- Word exists in English.

This looks valid.

<guess>CANDY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: CANDY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on CANDY we now have exact placements:

A is in position 2 (✓)  
N is in position 3 (✓)  
Y is in position 5 (✓)  

We also know that C and D are not in the word at all (x).

So the unknown letters are in positions 1 and 4, and must be drawn from the remaining pool that excludes:
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, C, D

Available letters (excluding the above and excluding A, N, Y which are already placed):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two distinct consonants from this set, one for spot 1 and one for spot 4, forming a valid English word.

Thinking of common 5-letter words matching the pattern  _ A N _ Y:

- BANGY? (B, G) – not a recognized word
- FANCY – C is excluded
- MANGY – M and G, and MANGY is a valid word
- HANKY – H and K, and HANKY is valid
- TANGY – T and G, TANGY is valid
- VANNY – repeats N (not necessary)
- BANTY – T is fine, but BANTY is uncommon
- WANKY – W and K, but WANKY is slang and might not be in the allowed list

The clearest valid choices among these are MANGY, HANKY, TANGY.  
They all satisfy:
- Positions 2,3,5 fixed as A N Y
- All letters come from the still-allowed set
- All are real 5-letter English words
- No letter reused except A, N, Y which are already placed

Among them, TANGY is very common and uses the frequently-occurring T and G, giving maximal information.

Therefore, I’ll choose TANGY.
