For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains all 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.

- ""STOCK"" – S in 1st, O in 3rd, C/K new.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains all 5 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

With these constraints, I’ll look for a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Contains S, but not in position 4.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, E).

Candidate words:
- ""POINT"" – has O in 3rd, but P, I, N, T are new; S is missing.
- ""CLOUD"" – O in 3rd, but S is missing.
- ""SPOIL"" – S in 1st, O in 3rd, but I/L are new.
- ""STOCK"" – S in 1st, O in 3rd, C/K new.

""STOCK"" meets all criteria: O in 3rd, S not in 4th, and introduces new letters (T, C, K) to test.

- SPOIL (P, I, L still possible)
