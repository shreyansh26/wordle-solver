For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. The best starting words in Wordle typically use 5 unique common letters. Two of the most popular choices are ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"". 

Between these, ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters. C and R are particularly useful consonants, A is the most common vowel, and N/E are frequent. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

I'll go with CRANE as it has a good mix of consonants and vowels with high frequency letters.

Current known facts
- Word still starts with C (first letter locked in).
- Letters totally absent from the word (x): R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D, H, M, P.
- Letters present but in wrong positions (yellow/-): I – it is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out (consonants and vowels still allowed):
B, F, G, J, K, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  plus the vowel I (which must appear somewhere else).

We need a pattern C _ _ _ _ and we must use I in one of positions 2, 4 or 5 and fill the remaining slots with any of the still-allowed letters.

Quick scan of common 5-letter C-words that contain I but avoid all forbidden letters and don’t put I in 3rd place:
- CIVIC – but both C’s are already fixed at the start and we don’t know if another C exists; also V already unused.
- CIGAR – R is out.
- CUBIC – U is out.
- CISTS – S twice, but C and S are allowed; I at 2, S at 3, T at 5.  But we have S,T still allowed.
- CYSTI – not a word.
- CIVVY – V twice, but V is allowed.
- CIVIL – already considered.
- CISTS – valid word, uses new letters S and T and places I in position 2 (which is safe).

Let’s pick CISTS because it re-uses C (known), puts I in position 2 (allowed), and introduces S and T which are still possible.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. The best starting words in Wordle typically use 5 unique common letters. Two of the most popular choices are ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"". 

Between these, ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common letters. C and R are particularly useful consonants, A is the most common vowel, and N/E are frequent. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

I'll go with CRANE as it has a good mix of consonants and vowels with high frequency letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is at position 1 (✓) – fixed
- R, A, N, E are all not in the word (x) – eliminate these letters

We now know:
- Word starts with C _ _ _ _
- Cannot contain R, A, N, E
- Must be 5 letters

Next, I want a word that:
- Starts with C
- Uses new common letters (especially vowels and consonants not yet tested)
- Avoids R, A, N, E

Good vowels left: I, O, U
Good consonants left: S, T, L, D, P, M, etc.

A balanced choice: C + O + I + S + T in a valid word → ""COIST"" isn’t valid, but ""COBIS"" isn’t either. Trying valid words: ""CLOUD"" has U/O, ""CHIPS"" has I/S, etc.

""CLOUD"" is a valid word using C (fixed at 1), L, O, U, D – none of which are R/A/N/E.

- Word starts with C (fixed)
- Letters already ruled out: R, A, N, E, L, O, U, D
- Remaining letters that are still possible (among common ones): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Begins with C
2. Uses only letters not in the forbidden set
3. Uses new common letters to maximize information

Looking for common patterns, the next vowels to test are I (since A, E, O, U are out). Good consonants left include S, T, M, P, etc.

Possible first-guess words that fit:
- CISTY (invalid – Y may be okay, but “CISTY” isn’t a common word)
- CIVIL (uses I twice, but V is allowed)
- CHIMP (H, I, M, P are all new and valid)

""CHIMP"" uses C (fixed), H, I, M, P – all new letters that haven’t been tried yet. It’s a valid word and should give good coverage.

Let’s go with CHIMP.
