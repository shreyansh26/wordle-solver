To start the Wordle game, it's strategic to make a first guess that uses common letters to gather as much information as possible. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess would be a word that covers a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It contains three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common.
- It has two common consonants (R, S).
- No letters are repeated, maximizing the information gained from the feedback.

This gives us a strong foundation to interpret the feedback and narrow down possible words in subsequent guesses.

A(x) – A is NOT in the word.  
R(x) – R is NOT in the word.  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word.  
S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

- The word has an S somewhere except the last position.

1. Keeps S but moves it away from the 5th slot,
2. Introduces fresh common letters not yet ruled out,
3. Avoids the eliminated letters,

- S is now in the 1st position (satisfying “not in 5th”).
- Uses new consonants L, N, T and the still-possible vowel A (but A was already ruled out!) – oops, A was eliminated.

Let’s pick a word without A, R, O, E, and still common: “SLINK”

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

- The word has an S somewhere except the last position.
- We still have no information on consonants like T, L, N, C, K, M, D, etc. and vowels like I, U.

A good follow-up guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it away from the 5th slot,
2. Introduces fresh common letters not yet ruled out,
3. Avoids the eliminated letters,

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLINK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) I(✓) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

1. Eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, N, K  
2. Fixed letters:
   - S(✓) in position 1  
   - I(✓) in position 3  
3. Mis-placed letters:
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
4. Still untested common letters: T, U, C, D, M, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S  
- Has I in the 3rd spot  
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Candidate structure: S _ I _ _

Possible pattern:
- Position 2: any of T, U, C, D, M, Y, etc. (not yet ruled out)  
- Position 4: L (since L is mis-placed and we haven’t tried it there)  
- Position 5: another consonant or vowel that hasn’t been eliminated

One common word that fits: “STILL”

Check:
- S (✓) position 1  
- T – new letter  
- I (✓) position 3  
- L – correct letter, now in position 4 (allowed)  
- L – repeated, still allowed  
Eliminated letters avoided: A,R,O,E,N,K absent.  
This tests T and confirms placement of L.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of the constraints so far:

- Positions we know:
  1. S (fixed)
  3. I (fixed)
  4. L (fixed)
  5. L (fixed)

- So the word must look like: S _ I L L

- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, N, K, T

- Letters still available for position 2: Any consonant or vowel not yet eliminated and not already locked in. Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, a few form actual 5-letter words: B, C, D, G, M, P, W, Y.

- We need an English word that fits the pattern S _ I L L.

Possible candidates:  
- SKILL – uses K, but K was already ruled out (Guess 2 feedback: K(x)).  
- SPILL – uses P, which has not been used or ruled out.  
- SWILL – uses W, not ruled out yet.  
- SCILL – not a recognized English word.  
- SDILL – not recognized.  
- SMILL – not recognized.  
- SBILL – not recognized.  
- SHILL – valid word.

Between SPILL, SWILL, and SHILL, any could work. Let me pick SPILL as it is a common word and introduces the letter P.

Let me verify:  
S P I L L  
- S is confirmed position 1 (✓)  
- P has not been tested yet, and is allowed.  
- I is confirmed position 3 (✓)  
- L is confirmed positions 4 and 5 (✓)  
- All letters are allowed (no A, R, O, E, N, K, T).

SPILL is a valid guess.

S _ I L L (from positions 1, 3, 4, 5 all confirmed)

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, E, N, K, T, P

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ I L L that uses a letter in position 2 that has NOT yet been eliminated.

Real 5-letter English words that fit S _ I L L and avoid all banned letters:
- SHILL  (H not yet tested)
- SWILL  (W not yet tested)
- SKILL  – but K is banned
- SCILL  – not a recognized word
- SMILL  – not a recognized word
- SBILL  – not a recognized word
- SDILL  – not a recognized word
- SGILL  – not a recognized word

Among the two valid options (SHILL and SWILL), choose SHILL first because it introduces the common consonant H.

All letters S, H, I, L are allowed (none banned), and it fits the pattern S _ I L L.
