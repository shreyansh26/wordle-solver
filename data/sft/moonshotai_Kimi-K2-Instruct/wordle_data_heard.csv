Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, the strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common consonants include R, S, T, N, L, and common vowels include A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: most common vowel
- R: very common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This gives a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.

- Letters to avoid: O, S, C, T
- R must be placed somewhere other than 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (since 2nd and 3rd are already E and A). Therefore R must be in 4th or 5th.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:

- R must appear in position 4 or 5
- No O, S, C, T

Let’s list possible valid English words fitting the pattern “?EAR?” or “?EA?R”.

- “PEARL” fits: P-E-A-R-L. R is in 4th, no forbidden letters.
- “FEARN” is not a valid word.
- “BEARD” fits: B-E-A-R-D. R is in 4th, but D is allowed.
- “HEART” includes T, which is forbidden.
- “DEARY” uses Y, which is allowed but the word is less common.

The most common consonants include R, S, T, N, L, and common vowels include A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. \n\nOne of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- A: most common vowel\n- R: very common consonant\n- O: common vowel\n- S: very common consonant\n- E: most common letter overall\n\nThis gives a good spread of high-frequency letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2\n- O(x) : O is NOT in the word\n- S(x) : S is NOT in the word\n- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo the secret word contains A, R, E (each at some other spot) and definitely does NOT contain O or S.\n\nTo pick a second guess we want to:\n1. Use A, R, E in different positions from before.\n2. Use new common letters to test additional positions.\n3.

From the latest feedback:

- P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 2 and is correct.
- A(✓) → A is in position 3 and is correct.
- R(✓) → R is in position 4 and is correct.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.

Current known pattern:
- _ E A R _

Confirmed letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, P, L.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? E A R ?

Let’s list possible final letters (position 5) that haven’t been ruled out:
Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English words ending in these letters and matching the pattern:
- BEARD (D) - but R is already in 4th, and we have _EAR_, so BEARD won't fit since it requires D in 5th and B in 1st, but _EAR_ with B gives BEARD: B E A R D. This seems valid.
- FEAR? - no common words.
- GEAR? - GEAR? - but needs a 5-letter word: GEARS (but S is excluded), GEAR? - no.
- HEARD - but D is allowed, H is allowed: H E A R D.
- NEAR? - NEARS (S excluded), no.
- WEARY - but Y is allowed: W E A R Y. However, this uses Y in 5th which is uncommon.
- YEARN - but positions are wrong (needs E in 2nd, A in 3rd, R in 4th): Y E A R N.

Between HEARD and BEARD:
- HEARD: H E A R D - all letters allowed, no conflicts.
- BEARD: B E A R D - all letters allowed, no conflicts.

HEARD seems more likely given frequency. Let’s go with HEARD.
