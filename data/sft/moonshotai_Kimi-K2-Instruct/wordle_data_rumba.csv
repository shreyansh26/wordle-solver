For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Uses 5 unique letters (no duplicates) to test more possibilities
4. Is statistically likely to contain common English letters

Common starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, ADIEU, AUDIO, RAISE, etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common in English words)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:  
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E

My next guess should:
1. Still test common letters we haven’t tried yet (like R, N, I, O, C, D)
2. Place A in a different position (not 3)
3. Avoid the 4 letters already ruled out

A strong candidate word that meets these criteria is “RADIO”:

- A is moved to position 2
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, D, I, O

Letters that ARE in the word:  
A (somewhere other than positions 2 or 3)  
R (exactly in position 1)

So the secret word looks like: R _ _ _ _

Likely positions for A: 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is excluded by both guesses).

Next guess should:
- Keep R in position 1.
- Place A in a new spot (let’s try position 2).
- Use three new, common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., N, C, K / M / H).

A good candidate is RANCH:

This maximizes information while fitting all constraints.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, D, I, O, N, C, H  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
R (at position 1)  
A (somewhere, but NOT at positions 2, 3)  

So the word looks like: R _ A _ _  or  R _ _ A _ or R _ _ _ A.

Since positions 2, 3 have now been ruled out for A, the only remaining possible positions for A are 4 or 5 (word indices 4 or 5), i.e., patterns:

- R _ _ A _
- R _ _ _ A

We need to test new consonants that have not been used yet.  Available consonants that are common and not yet guessed include: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

I’ll now pick a word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Puts A in position 4 (to test that spot).
3. Uses three new consonants.

Candidate: RAGMA – but G and M haven’t been tried, but I’d like a legal word.  Let’s pick RAGMA’s cousin: RAGMA isn’t valid, but “RAGMA” isn’t a word.  
A valid word is RAKMA?  No.  Let me pick a real word: RAPID – but D and I are out.  RAVEN – E and N are out.  RAMBO – O and B are untried, but O is out.  RUMMY – M, M, Y: but M and Y are new, but it has two M’s.  RUMMY is a word, but let’s use unique letters to maximize coverage.  RAYON – Y, O, N: but O and N are out.

Next choice: RAGGY – has two G’s, not ideal.  RAGUS – S and U: S out.  RAJAH – J and H: H is out.  RALPH – L, P, H: L and H out.  RAMAL – two A’s.  RAMMY – two M’s.  RANKS – N, K, S: N, S out.  RAPHE – P, H: H out.  RATHE – T, H, E: all out.  RAVEN – V, E, N: E, N out.

We need a word that starts with R, has A in position 4 or 5, and uses only consonants that haven’t been eliminated.

Let’s pick A in position 4: R _ _ A _

We need three new consonants.  Let’s use M, B, K.  A valid word: RUMBA – but we already ruled out U (no, U hasn’t been tried yet).  U hasn’t been ruled out.  Let me check: U hasn’t been guessed before.  Also, B, M are new.  RUMBA is a valid 5-letter English word.

So let’s try RUMBA.

Pattern: R U M B A  
- R is fixed at position 1.  
- A is at position 5 – a new location.  
- U, M, B are all new and untried consonants (U is technically a vowel, but it hasn’t been used).  

This should give us maximal new information.

<guess>RUMBA</guess>",RUMBA,"Summary of what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, D, I, O, N, C, H  

Letters that ARE in the word:  
R (at position 1)  
A (somewhere, but NOT at positions 2, 3)  

So the word looks like: R _ A _ _  or  R _ _ A _ or R _ _ _ A.

Since positions 2, 3 have now been ruled out for A, the only remaining possible positions for A are 4 or 5 (word indices 4 or 5), i.e., patterns:

- R _ _ A _
- R _ _ _ A

We need to test new consonants that have not been used yet.  Available consonants that are common and not yet guessed include: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

I’ll now pick a word that:
1. Starts with R.
2. Puts A in position 4 (to test that spot).
3. Uses three new consonants.
