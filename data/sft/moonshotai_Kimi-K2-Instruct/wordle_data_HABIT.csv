Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters, ideally including several vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This combination covers 5 different common letters, which should give helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated): C, R, N, E, D, O, S, P, L  
Letters definitely IN the word: A, I, T  
Exact positions now fixed:
- I is in slot 4 (✓)
- T is in slot 5 (✓)

Remaining slots to fill: 1, 2, 3  
Allowed letters left (common ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus A (but A may not sit in slot 3).

We still need to place A somewhere other than slot 1, 3, or 4 (from earlier), so A must be slot 2.

So current partial word: _ A _ I T

We need two different consonants for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the still-allowed set.  
Good candidates that give maximum new information: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, Y

A common test word meeting these constraints is “GAIT” – but that’s only 4 letters.  
We need 5 letters and must use slot 3.

A valid 5-letter word matching _ A _ I T is “HABIT”:
- H: new consonant  
- A: slot 2 (allowed)  
- B: new consonant  
- I: fixed in slot 4  
- T: fixed in slot 5  

And “HABIT” uses only still-allowed letters.
