For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained. Good starting words often include A, E, R, S, T, N, or L. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of frequently used letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in first position.
- L is NOT in the word.
- A, T, E are all in the word and in their current positions (A in 3rd, T in 4th, E in 5th).

So the pattern is: S _ A T E  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in the 3rd spot, T in the 4th, and E in the 5th, and does NOT contain L.

Possible candidates: SKATE, SPATE, STATE, SHATE  
- SKATE – valid, no L, fits pattern.
- SPATE – valid, no L, fits pattern.
- STATE – valid, no L, fits pattern.
- SHATE – not a valid English word.

Among SKATE, SPATE, STATE, I’ll go with STATE as it’s very common and uses a new consonant (N) in the second position, giving us new information.

So the next guess is STATE.

Current known facts:
- Pattern so far: S _ A T E
- From Guess 1 (SLATE):  
  S(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) → these four letters are locked in their exact positions.  
  L(x) – L is not in the word.

- From Guess 2 (STATE):  
  The second letter T(–) means T is in the word but NOT in the second position.  
  We already know T is fixed at the 4th position, so this is consistent and gives no new information.

Therefore the only unknown is the second letter (position 2). The word must be of the form S _ A T E and the second letter cannot be L or T. Common remaining consonants for that slot: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.

Quick scan of common English words matching S _ A T E:
- SKATE – but K was never tested yet.
- SPATE – P tested not yet.
- SLATE – already ruled out (L is excluded).
- SHATE – not a valid word.
- SCATE – not a valid word.
- SNATE – not a valid word.
- SMATE – not a valid word.
- SWATE – not a valid word.

The only valid, common word left is SKATE. Let’s try it.
