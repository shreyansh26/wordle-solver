For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ones like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar coverage
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - includes the less common 'I' but still strong
- ""ADIEU"" is very vowel-heavy (A, I, E, U) which can be good for vowel placement but may miss some key consonants

""SLATE"" seems like a balanced choice with high frequency letters and good vowel/consonant mix. This should give us good information about letter presence and positions regardless of the hidden word.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ L _ E  
   (L is definitely in position 3 and E is somewhere in the last four positions—originally thought E was fixed at 5, but the second guess shows E was only marked “-”, meaning E is in the word but NOT necessarily at position 5.)

2. Letters not in the word: S, A, T, O, I, R.

3. Letters that are in the word with known positions: L (3rd), E (somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 but NOT 5 from the first guess—so positions 1,2,4).

4. Therefore possible E positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has L in position 3.
- Has E in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only remaining possible letters (avoid S, A, T, O, I, R).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have only 5-letter English words to consider.

Possible pattern looks like:
E _ L _ _  (if E is 1st)
_ E L _ _  (if E is 2nd)
_ _ L E _  (if E is 4th)

Let’s try a word like “FLEET”:
Check constraints:
- L is 3rd ✓
- E appears in 2nd and 5th. 5th E contradicts feedback from guess 1 where E wasn’t at 5th, but 2nd E is possible. However, the word has duplicate E which might not give new info.

Better: “DULCE” – but includes U and C, but C and U are still possible.
However, we haven’t confirmed U is in word.

Another possibility: “MELON” – but O is already excluded.

Wait, we need to avoid O, I, R, S, A, T.

Let’s try “BLEED”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 2nd and 5th, but 5th E is invalid (from guess 1), so only E 2nd is possible.
Also double E is fine.

But “BLEED” has D which is new.

But let’s see a better fit: “DWELL” – but L is 4th here, not 3rd.

“ELBOW” – L is 2nd, not 3rd.

“HELIX” – I and X, but I is excluded.

“JULES” – S is excluded.

“KNELT” – T is excluded.

“UPLED” – not a real word.

Let’s try “ELDER”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 1st (allowed)
- R is excluded (from guess 2), so R cannot be there – this fails.

“ULCER” – R is excluded.

“GLUED” – U and D are possible, but E is 5th which contradicts guess 1.

Wait, let’s re-examine: E cannot be 5th (from guess 1), but guess 2 shows E is “-” in position 5, meaning E is NOT in 5th. So possible positions for E: 1,2,4.

Let’s pick a word with E in 2nd position: e.g., “FLESH” – but S and H. S is excluded.

“CLEPE” – E 2nd and 5th, 5th E invalid.

“BLEAK” – A is excluded.

“CLEEK” – E 2nd and 4th. 4th E is possible.

Check “CLEEK”:
Letters: C, L, E, E, K

Let me double-check: “OILER” has no S, A, T, and includes L not in position 2. This should give good info.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: OILER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) I(x) L(✓) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ _ L _ E  
   (L is definitely in position 3 and E is somewhere in the last four positions—originally thought E was fixed at 5, but the second guess shows E was only marked “-”, meaning E is in the word but NOT necessarily at position 5.)

2. Letters not in the word: S, A, T, O, I, R.

3. Letters that are in the word with known positions: L (3rd), E (somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 but NOT 5 from the first guess—so positions 1,2,4).

4. Therefore possible E positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has L in position 3.
- Has E in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only remaining possible letters (avoid S, A, T, O, I, R).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have only 5-letter English words to consider.

Possible pattern looks like:
E _ L _ _  (if E is 1st)
_ E L _ _  (if E is 2nd)
_ _ L E _  (if E is 4th)

Let’s try a word like “FLEET”:
Check constraints:
- L is 3rd ✓
- E appears in 2nd and 5th. 5th E contradicts feedback from guess 1 where E wasn’t at 5th, but 2nd E is possible. However, the word has duplicate E which might not give new info.

Better: “DULCE” – but includes U and C, but C and U are still possible.
However, we haven’t confirmed U is in word.

Another possibility: “MELON” – but O is already excluded.

Wait, we need to avoid O, I, R, S, A, T.

Let’s try “BLEED”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 2nd and 5th, but 5th E is invalid (from guess 1), so only E 2nd is possible.
Also double E is fine.

But “BLEED” has D which is new.

But let’s see a better fit: “DWELL” – but L is 4th here, not 3rd.

“ELBOW” – L is 2nd, not 3rd.

“HELIX” – I and X, but I is excluded.

“JULES” – S is excluded.

“KNELT” – T is excluded.

“UPLED” – not a real word.

Realizing that E must be in 1,2, or 4, and L is 3rd.

Let’s try “ELDER”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 1st (allowed)
- R is excluded (from guess 2), so R cannot be there – this fails.

“ULCER” – R is excluded.

“GLUED” – U and D are possible, but E is 5th which contradicts guess 1.

Wait, let’s re-examine: E cannot be 5th (from guess 1), but guess 2 shows E is “-” in position 5, meaning E is NOT in 5th. So possible positions for E: 1,2,4.

Let’s pick a word with E in 2nd position: e.g., “FLESH” – but S and H. S is excluded.

“CLEPE” – E 2nd and 5th, 5th E invalid.

“BLEAK” – A is excluded.

“CLEEK” – E 2nd and 4th. 4th E is possible.

Check “CLEEK”:
Letters: C, L, E, E, K
- L is 3rd ✓
- E is 2nd and 4th – 2nd E is possible
- No forbidden letters
- Real word

This seems valid.

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word

   - E is NOT in position 5 (from SLATE) and NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from CLEEK).  
     So E must be in position 1 … but position 1 is already taken by L.  
   - This contradiction means our earlier reading was incomplete.

Re-read carefully:

- SLATE: L(-) means L is in the word but **not** in position 2. It does **not** exclude position 3.  
- CLEEK: L(-) means L is **not** in position 2. Still does **not** exclude position 3.  
- CLEEK: E(-) in positions 3 and 4 means E is **not** in 3 or 4. Earlier SLATE had E(✓) in position 5, so E is fixed at 5.

Therefore the pattern is: _ _ L _ E

Common starting words include ones like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar coverage
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - includes the less common 'I' but still strong

- E is in the correct position (5th letter).

We must avoid S, A, T entirely.

4. Therefore possible E positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has L in position 3.
- Has E in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only remaining possible letters (avoid S, A, T, O, I, R).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have only 5-letter English words to consider.

Possible pattern looks like:
E _ L _ _  (if E is 1st)
_ E L _ _  (if E is 2nd)
_ _ L E _  (if E is 4th)

Let’s try a word like “FLEET”:
Check constraints:
- L is 3rd ✓
- E appears in 2nd and 5th. 5th E contradicts feedback from guess 1 where E wasn’t at 5th, but 2nd E is possible. However, the word has duplicate E which might not give new info.

Better: “DULCE” – but includes U and C, but C and U are still possible.
However, we haven’t confirmed U is in word.

Another possibility: “MELON” – but O is already excluded.

Wait, we need to avoid O, I, R, S, A, T.

Let’s try “BLEED”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 2nd and 5th, but 5th E is invalid (from guess 1), so only E 2nd is possible.
Also double E is fine.

But “BLEED” has D which is new.

But let’s see a better fit: “DWELL” – but L is 4th here, not 3rd.

“ELBOW” – L is 2nd, not 3rd.

“HELIX” – I and X, but I is excluded.

“JULES” – S is excluded.

“KNELT” – T is excluded.

“UPLED” – not a real word.

Realizing that E must be in 1,2, or 4, and L is 3rd.

Let’s try “ELDER”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 1st (allowed)
- R is excluded (from guess 2), so R cannot be there – this fails.

“ULCER” – R is excluded.

“GLUED” – U and D are possible, but E is 5th which contradicts guess 1.

Wait, let’s re-examine: E cannot be 5th (from guess 1), but guess 2 shows E is “-” in position 5, meaning E is NOT in 5th. So possible positions for E: 1,2,4.

Let’s pick a word with E in 2nd position: e.g., “FLESH” – but S and H. S is excluded.

“CLEPE” – E 2nd and 5th, 5th E invalid.

“BLEAK” – A is excluded.

“CLEEK” – E 2nd and 4th. 4th E is possible.

Check “CLEEK”:
Letters: C, L, E, E, K

Let's synthesize all the clues.

Known facts  
- E is in the word and is at position 5.  
- L is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5 (from SLATE L(-), CLEEK L(-), FLUME L(-)); therefore L **must** be in position 1.  
So far we have: L _ _ _ E  

Letters already ruled out completely:  
S, A, T, O, I, R, C, K, F, U, M  

Still-available letters (common ones):  
B, D, G, H, N, P, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with L, ends with E, and uses only the allowed letters in the middle three spots.  
Possible pattern: L _ _ _ E

Looking at remaining consonants, let’s try a real word fitting that form:  
L + Y + N + D + E  → LYNDE (valid proper noun, but Wordle accepts it).  
More common: L + I + N + D + E (I is excluded) → invalid.  
L + A + N + D + E → A excluded.  
L + U + N + G + E → U excluded.  
L + A + N + G + E → A excluded.  

The simplest remaining common word is L + Y + N + D + E → LYNDE, but Wordle sometimes rejects proper names.  
Next best is L + I + N + D + E → I excluded.  
Real option: L + I + N + E → ""LINEN"" fails, letters used.  

Wait, we have only three slots to fill.  Real English word: “LEDGE”  
- L ✓  
- E ✓  
- D, G, E are allowed.  Pattern: L _ D _ E.  Position 2 must be a consonant, 3 must be consonant, 4 consonant.  

“LEDGE” fits L E D G E.  
Check letters: L, E, D, G are all allowed.  It is a valid 5-letter word.

Double-check:  
LEDGE – positions 1 = L, 5 = E, so matches fixed positions.  
Letters used are all allowed.  No excluded letters appear.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common starting words include ones like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - similar coverage
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - includes the less common 'I' but still strong
- ""ADIEU"" is very vowel-heavy (A, I, E, U) which can be good for vowel placement but may miss some key consonants

""SLATE"" seems like a balanced choice with high frequency letters and good vowel/consonant mix. This should give us good information about letter presence and positions regardless of the hidden word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- S, A, T are not in the word at all.

Since E is locked in place, the pattern is _ _ _ _ E.
We know L exists somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 5 is E, so 1, 3, or 4).
We must avoid S, A, T entirely.

Good next letters to try: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, H, etc.
Let’s build a word that:
- Ends with E
- Includes L somewhere not 2nd
- Avoids S, A, T

One strong candidate is “OILER” — O, I, L, E, R:
- Ends with E (match)
- L is in position 3 (valid since L is not fixed to position 2)
- Uses new letters O, I, R and avoids S, A, T.

Let me double-check: “OILER” has no S, A, T, and includes L not in position 2. This should give good info.

1. Pattern so far: _ _ L _ E  
   (L is definitely in position 3 and E is somewhere in the last four positions—originally thought E was fixed at 5, but the second guess shows E was only marked “-”, meaning E is in the word but NOT necessarily at position 5.)

2. Letters not in the word: S, A, T, O, I, R.

3. Letters that are in the word with known positions: L (3rd), E (somewhere in positions 1,2,4,5 but NOT 5 from the first guess—so positions 1,2,4).

4. Therefore possible E positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has L in position 3.
- Has E in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only remaining possible letters (avoid S, A, T, O, I, R).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have only 5-letter English words to consider.

Possible pattern looks like:
E _ L _ _  (if E is 1st)
_ E L _ _  (if E is 2nd)
_ _ L E _  (if E is 4th)

Let’s try a word like “FLEET”:
Check constraints:
- L is 3rd ✓
- E appears in 2nd and 5th. 5th E contradicts feedback from guess 1 where E wasn’t at 5th, but 2nd E is possible. However, the word has duplicate E which might not give new info.

Better: “DULCE” – but includes U and C, but C and U are still possible.
However, we haven’t confirmed U is in word.

Another possibility: “MELON” – but O is already excluded.

Wait, we need to avoid O, I, R, S, A, T.

Let’s try “BLEED”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 2nd and 5th, but 5th E is invalid (from guess 1), so only E 2nd is possible.
Also double E is fine.

But “BLEED” has D which is new.

But let’s see a better fit: “DWELL” – but L is 4th here, not 3rd.

“ELBOW” – L is 2nd, not 3rd.

“HELIX” – I and X, but I is excluded.

“JULES” – S is excluded.

“KNELT” – T is excluded.

“UPLED” – not a real word.

Realizing that E must be in 1,2, or 4, and L is 3rd.

Let’s try “ELDER”:
- L 3rd ✓
- E 1st (allowed)
- R is excluded (from guess 2), so R cannot be there – this fails.

“ULCER” – R is excluded.

“GLUED” – U and D are possible, but E is 5th which contradicts guess 1.

Wait, let’s re-examine: E cannot be 5th (from guess 1), but guess 2 shows E is “-” in position 5, meaning E is NOT in 5th. So possible positions for E: 1,2,4.

Let’s pick a word with E in 2nd position: e.g., “FLESH” – but S and H. S is excluded.

“CLEPE” – E 2nd and 5th, 5th E invalid.

“BLEAK” – A is excluded.

“CLEEK” – E 2nd and 4th. 4th E is possible.

Check “CLEEK”:
Letters: C, L, E, E, K
- L is 3rd ✓
- E is 2nd and 4th – 2nd E is possible
- No forbidden letters
- Real word

This seems valid.

3. Positions ruled out

     So L must be in position 1.  
   - E is NOT in position 5 (from SLATE) and NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from CLEEK).  
     So E must be in position 1 … but position 1 is already taken by L.  
   - This contradiction means our earlier reading was incomplete.

Re-read carefully:

- SLATE: L(-) means L is in the word but **not** in position 2. It does **not** exclude position 3.  
- CLEEK: L(-) means L is **not** in position 2. Still does **not** exclude position 3.  
- CLEEK: E(-) in positions 3 and 4 means E is **not** in 3 or 4. Earlier SLATE had E(✓) in position 5, so E is fixed at 5.

Therefore the pattern is: _ _ L _ E

Letters still unused that are allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Re-examining all feedback:

1. E is in positions 2 and 5.
   - From LEDGE: E(✓) at 2 and 5 ⇒ both must be E.
2. L is in the word but excluded from positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
   - SLATE L(-) → not pos 2  
   - OILER L(✓) → but this only confirmed L is present; the “✓” means it’s in the word, not fixed yet.  
   - CLEEK L(-) → not pos 3  
   - FLUME L(-) → not pos 2  
   - LEDGE L(-) → not pos 1  

   So L is present but **none** of the positions 1–5 have it marked ✓.  That is impossible for a 5-letter word.  
   The only logical conclusion is that my prior interpretation of OILER L(✓) must mean L is in **position 3**, because OILER feedback was:
   O(x) I(x) L(✓) E(-) R(x)  
   The ✓ is at the L, i.e. **L is in position 3**.

   Therefore the pattern is _ _ L _ _ with E somewhere.  
   SLATE showed E(✓) at 5 → E is at 5.  
   Thus pattern: _ _ L _ E
