Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to guide my choice. The optimal strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as possible. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like A, E)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong starters include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, or STARE. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in the first position (-).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).

So we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. The first letter is NOT C.
3. The word does NOT contain R, A, or N.
4. The word DOES contain C, just not in the first position.

Remaining common letters to test: S, T, L, M, P, D, B, G, H, I, O, U, Y.

Since C is somewhere in the middle, possible positions 2-4. I need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains C (not first)
- Avoids R, A, N
- Uses new common letters

Good options: STOLE (but has no C), SCONE (but N is excluded), SPICE (but I and P are less common), BLOKE (no C), CHOSE (but R is excluded).

""CHOSE"" fits:
- Ends with E
- Contains C in position 2
- Doesn't contain R, A, N
- Tests new common letters H, O, S

But wait - CHOSE has C in position 2, which is allowed since C can be in positions 2-4. However, I should check if O and S are allowed - they're not in the excluded letters.

Let me think of another: ""CLOSE"" - but A is excluded, so O is allowed. CLOSE has C in position 1 which is excluded. 

""SCOPE"" - ends with E, has C in position 3, avoids R,A,N. Tests S,P,O.

I'll go with SCOPE as it tests more new letters.

But looking back, CHOSE might be better as it tests H which is common. Actually let me pick ""SCOPE"" since P is less common than H but O and S are very common. 

Wait, ""CLOVE"" has C in position 1 which is excluded. 

""CHIDE"" - has C in position 1 which is excluded.

""SPICE"" - has C in position 3, ends with E, avoids R,A,N. Tests S,P,I.

I think ""SPICE"" is a good choice.

But let me reconsider - ""CHOSE"" has C in position 2 which is allowed, ends with E, avoids R,A,N. Tests H,O,S which are all common.

I think ""CHOSE"" is slightly better as it tests more common consonants.

But CHOSE has H which might be less common than S. Let me go with ""SCOPE"".

Actually, ""CHOSE"" uses O,H,S - all common, while SCOPE uses S,P,O. H is more common than P, so CHOSE is better.
