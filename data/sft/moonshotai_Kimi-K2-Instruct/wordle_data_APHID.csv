For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to use letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good first guess should include a mix of vowels and consonants. Words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they use common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(✓) – the first letter is definitely A.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – none of R, O, S, E appear anywhere else in the word.

So our second guess must:
- Start with A.  
- Contain none of R, O, S, E.  
- Still use only valid English 5-letter words.

We need fresh, common letters to test next. Common unused consonants now are T, N, L, D, C, M, P, G, H, B, K, etc. and the remaining vowels are I, U, Y.

A useful word that satisfies these rules and tests several new high-frequency letters is “ACIDY”:
- Starts with A.  
- Uses C, I, D, Y – none of which were in the first guess.  
- All are common letters that help narrow the remaining pool quickly.

So far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with A
   - R, O, S, E not in the word at all

2. ACIDY → A(✓) C(x) I(-) D(-) Y(x)
   - C and Y not in the word
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. ADMIN → A(✓) D(-) M(x) I(✓) N(x)
   - M and N not in the word
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 2
   - I is now confirmed in position 4 (✓)

Current known facts:
- Word form: A _ _ I _
- Must contain D somewhere in positions 2, 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 4 are taken by A and I)
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, E, C, Y, M, N
- Remaining frequently used letters: T, L, G, H, B, K, U, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, ending with I in position 4, containing D in positions 2, 3 or 5, and only using allowed letters.

Let's think of possibilities:
- A D _ I _ (D in position 2)
- A _ D I _ (D in position 3)
- A _ _ I D (D in position 5)

Possible valid English words:
- AVID? (but V is less common and we haven't tested it)
- AUDIT? (but ends with T, has U, but let's see if we can find a better test)
- AHOLD? (H is allowed but O is already eliminated)
- ALGID? (G is allowed but rare)
- APTLY? (P and T allowed but Y is eliminated)
- APHID? (P, H, D all allowed, and H is common)

""APHID"" seems good:
- Starts with A
- Has D in position 3 (allowed since D just needs to not be in position 2 or 4)
- Has I in position 4 (confirmed)
- Uses P and H which are common and untested
- Doesn't use any forbidden letters
