- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained about the secret word. This means choosing a word that contains common letters likely to appear in many 5-letter words. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Common letters in English:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Consonants: R, S, T, L, N, D, C, M, P, G

A well-known effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

The feedback tells us:
1. S is in the correct first position.
2. L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x = not in word).

So the word begins with S _ _ _ _ and does not contain L, A, T, or E.

Vowels left: I, O, U
Consonants left (common ones not ruled out): N, R, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Since E is ruled out and A is ruled out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We need to find a word that starts with S and uses none of L, A, T, E.

A good next guess would try to test as many new letters as possible, especially common ones. ""SOUND"" is a good candidate:
- S(✓) matches first position
- O, U are new vowels to test
- N, D are new consonants to test
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (L, A, T, E)

This will give us information on whether the word contains O, U, N, or D and help narrow down vowel and consonant possibilities.

Testing ""SONIC"" would check:
- I (remaining vowel)
- C (common consonant)
- Keeps N in the word (and since feedback said N is in wrong position in SOUND where it was 4th, placing it 3rd is valid)

Also avoids all previously ruled-out letters.
