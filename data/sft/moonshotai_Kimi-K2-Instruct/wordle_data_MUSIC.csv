For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and good letter distribution. Popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains all five of the most common English letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should give me maximum information about the secret word's letters and positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So the secret word:
- contains S  
- does NOT contain A, R, O, E  
- has 5 letters total, one of which is S in a different spot than position 4.  

To maximize information in the second guess, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps S in a new position (either 1, 2, 3, or 5)  
- avoids the eliminated letters A, R, O, E  
- introduces other high-frequency consonants (T, N, L, I, etc.)  

A good choice meeting these criteria is “STINK”:  
- S is moved from position 4 to position 1.  
- T, I, N, K are all new letters not yet tested.  
- No forbidden letters A, R, O, E appear.

Let’s tabulate what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, K, H, P  
Letters that ARE in the word (and their position exclusions):
- S: must appear, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STINK & CHIPS feedback).  
  ⇒ S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- I: must appear, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from STINK & CHIPS feedback).  
  ⇒ I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining, still-untested frequent letters: L, D, G, B, C (tested C already but it was only “-”), M, F, U, Y, W, V.

We need a 5-letter word using:
- letters only from {S, I} plus the still-allowed set {L, D, G, B, M, F, U, Y, W, V, C, …}  
- S in position 2 or 3  
- I in position 1, 4, or 5.

A quick scan of common words fitting these constraints gives “BUILD”:
- B: new letter, frequent.  
- U: new letter, frequent vowel.  
- I: in position 3, which is still allowed for I (position 3 was only excluded for I in earlier feedback? Wait, no: I was only excluded from 2 and 3. So 3 is still allowed for I? Actually, the feedback on STINK said I(-) meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So I can be in 1, 4, or 5. So BUILD has I in position 3 which is actually excluded.

“FUSIL”:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and good letter distribution. Popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains all five of the most common English letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should give me maximum information about the secret word's letters and positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So the secret word:
- contains S  
- does NOT contain A, R, O, E  
- has 5 letters total, one of which is S in a different spot than position 4.  

To maximize information in the second guess, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps S in a new position (either 1, 2, 3, or 5)  
- avoids the eliminated letters A, R, O, E  
- introduces other high-frequency consonants (T, N, L, I, etc.)  

A good choice meeting these criteria is “STINK”:  
- S is moved from position 4 to position 1.  
- T, I, N, K are all new letters not yet tested.  
- No forbidden letters A, R, O, E appear.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we have:

1. AROSE feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

2. STINK feedback: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) K(x)  
   ⇒ S is still in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2, 3, or 5).  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ T, N, K are NOT in the word.

Letters still allowed: S, I, plus any other consonants/vowels except the already-eliminated A R O E T N K.

Most frequent consonants not yet eliminated: L, D, G, B, C, H, M, P, F, U, Y …  
Most frequent vowels not yet eliminated: U, Y (I is already known to be in).

I want a word that:
- keeps S in one of positions 2, 3, or 5  
- keeps I in one of positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- uses only letters from the allowed set.

A good candidate is “CHIPS”:
- C, H, P are new, high-frequency consonants.  
- I is in position 2.  
- S is in position 5.  
- No eliminated letters appear.

This should give new positional info on S (position 5) and I (position 2) while testing three new consonants.
