For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities regardless of the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: Uses S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E - covers common consonants and a vowel
- AUDIO: Good for vowels but lacks common consonants
- AROSE: Uses A, R, O, S, E - strong coverage

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good feedback on letter presence regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback:
- R is in correct position (2nd letter)
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So the hidden word has:
- 2nd letter = R
- contains O somewhere but not at position 3
- does NOT contain A, S, E

Possible structure: _ R _ _ _ or _ _ R _ _ etc. but we know R is at position 2.

Word pattern: _ R _ _ _

Letters available (excluding A,S,E): B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Since O is in the word but not at position 3, it could be at 1, 4, or 5.

I'll try to cover common consonants and the letter O. A good next word could be ""FRONT"":
- F: not tried yet
- R: already confirmed at position 2
- O: must be somewhere (here at 3 - but feedback said O is wrong position at 3, so this would test if O is at 3)
- N: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Wait - the feedback said O is in word but wrong position (3), so putting O at 3 in next guess would be bad. Let me reconsider.

Alternative: ""CROWN""
- C: new letter
- R: matches position 2
- O: would be at position 3 again (same problem)

Better to place O at 1 or 4 or 5. Let's try ""PROUD"":

- O: position 3 (but we know O isn't at 3)

Summary of what we now know:

3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. Letters A, S, E, T do not appear at all.
5. B is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from ORBIT feedback: B(-) means B is present but wrong spot).

Current partial arrangement: _ R _ _ _

Possible positions for O: 4 or 5
Possible positions for B: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 2 is R, so 1, 4, 5)
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is R, so 1, 3, 5)

We need to pack O, B, I into the three empty slots (positions 1,3,4,5). Since O can only be 4 or 5, and B can be 1,4,5, and I can be 1,3,5, we can deduce:

Case 1: O at 4
- Then B and I must fit in 1,3,5
- B can be 1 or 5
- I can be 1,3,5
Possible combinations:
- B at 1, I at 3 or 5
- B at 5, I at 1 or 3

Case 2: O at 5

- B can be 1 or 4
- I can be 1 or 3
Possible combinations:

- B at 4, I at 1 or 3

Let's pick a word that satisfies one of these. For example:
- B at 1, I at 3, O at 4 → B R I O _
But we need 5 letters, so position 5 must be a new consonant not yet used (not A,S,E,T). Let's try D.

So ""BRIO?"" - we need a 5th letter. ""BRION"" is not a word, ""BRIOS"" has S (invalid). Next consonant: ""BRIOX"" is not valid.

Alternative: B at 1, I at 3, O at 5 → B R I _ O
Need a consonant for position 4 (not A,S,E,T). Try D → ""BRIDO"" (not a word), C → ""BRICO"" (valid word).

Let's go with BRICO:
B(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), O(5)
Check constraints:

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities regardless of the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: Uses S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E - covers common consonants and a vowel
- AUDIO: Good for vowels but lacks common consonants
- AROSE: Uses A, R, O, S, E - strong coverage

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good feedback on letter presence regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is in correct position (2nd letter)
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So the hidden word has:
- 2nd letter = R
- contains O somewhere but not at position 3
- does NOT contain A, S, E

Possible structure: _ R _ _ _ or _ _ R _ _ etc. but we know R is at position 2.

Word pattern: _ R _ _ _

Letters available (excluding A,S,E): B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Since O is in the word but not at position 3, it could be at 1, 4, or 5.

I'll try to cover common consonants and the letter O. A good next word could be ""FRONT"":
- F: not tried yet
- R: already confirmed at position 2
- O: must be somewhere (here at 3 - but feedback said O is wrong position at 3, so this would test if O is at 3)
- N: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Wait - the feedback said O is in word but wrong position (3), so putting O at 3 in next guess would be bad. Let me reconsider.

Alternative: ""CROWN""
- C: new letter
- R: matches position 2
- O: would be at position 3 again (same problem)

Better to place O at 1 or 4 or 5. Let's try ""PROUD"":
- P: new letter
- R: position 2
- O: position 3 (but we know O isn't at 3)

This is tricky. Let me try ""FROND"":
- F: new
- R: position 2
- O: position 3 (still same issue)

I need to place O somewhere else. Let's try ""TROOP"":
- T: new
- R: position 2
- O: positions 3 and 4 (but 3 is invalid for O)

Better approach: place O at position 1. Try ""ORBIT"":
- O: position 1
- R: position 2
- B: new
- I: new
- T: new

This seems good - O at 1, R at 2, and covering new letters B,I,T.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. R is in position 2 (fixed).
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. Letters A, S, E, T do not appear at all.
5. B is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from ORBIT feedback: B(-) means B is present but wrong spot).

Current partial arrangement: _ R _ _ _

Possible positions for O: 4 or 5
Possible positions for B: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 2 is R, so 1, 4, 5)
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is R, so 1, 3, 5)

We need to pack O, B, I into the three empty slots (positions 1,3,4,5). Since O can only be 4 or 5, and B can be 1,4,5, and I can be 1,3,5, we can deduce:

Case 1: O at 4
- Then B and I must fit in 1,3,5
- B can be 1 or 5
- I can be 1,3,5
Possible combinations:
- B at 1, I at 3 or 5
- B at 5, I at 1 or 3

Case 2: O at 5
- Then B and I must fit in 1,3,4
- B can be 1 or 4
- I can be 1 or 3
Possible combinations:
- B at 1, I at 3
- B at 4, I at 1 or 3

Let's pick a word that satisfies one of these. For example:
- B at 1, I at 3, O at 4 → B R I O _
But we need 5 letters, so position 5 must be a new consonant not yet used (not A,S,E,T). Let's try D.

So ""BRIO?"" - we need a 5th letter. ""BRION"" is not a word, ""BRIOS"" has S (invalid). Next consonant: ""BRIOX"" is not valid.

Alternative: B at 1, I at 3, O at 5 → B R I _ O
Need a consonant for position 4 (not A,S,E,T). Try D → ""BRIDO"" (not a word), C → ""BRICO"" (valid word).

Let's go with BRICO:
B(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), O(5)
Check constraints:
- O is at 5 (allowed, not 1 or 3)
- B is at 1 (allowed, not 3)
- I is at 3 (allowed, not 4)
- Uses new letters C (not yet tested)

   We need a 5-letter English word of the form BRIO?.  
   Valid English words: “BRIOS” (invalid, contains S), “BRIOU” (no), “BRION” (no), “BRIOT” (invalid, contains T), “BRIOK” (no).  
   Actually, “BRISK” is a word, but S is banned.  
   “BRICK” is invalid (C banned).  
   “BRIDE” – no (E banned).  
   “BRIGS” – no (S banned).  
   “BRIEF” – no (E banned).  
   “BRINY” – no (structure is B R I N Y; O missing).  
   Wait, the skeleton must include O.  
   Re-check: we must have O at 4, so word is B R I O _.  
   Real word: “BRION” is extremely obscure; more common is “BRIO” (only 4 letters).  
   Actually, the spelling “BRIO” is only four letters; we need five.  
   Perhaps “BRIOC” (no).  
   However, “BRIO” is pronounced “bree-oh,” and the usual 5-letter spelling is “BRIOU” (not standard).  
   Let me backtrack: the placement of O at 4 seems the only possibility.  
   A valid 5-letter word is “BRIOC,” but C is already banned (feedback: C(x)).  
   So we must choose another consonant for position 5 that makes a real word starting “BRIO”.  
   Checking a word list, “BRION” does exist (rare, but a valid proper noun).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

   A, S, E, T, C are all out.

5. The only blank left is position 5.  
   It must be a letter we have not yet tested and not in the banned set.  
   Letters not yet ruled out include D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   We need a 5-letter English word of the form BRIO?.  
   Valid English words: “BRIOS” (invalid, contains S), “BRIOU” (no), “BRION” (no), “BRIOT” (invalid, contains T), “BRIOK” (no).  
   Actually, “BRISK” is a word, but S is banned.  
   “BRICK” is invalid (C banned).  
   “BRIDE” – no (E banned).  
   “BRIGS” – no (S banned).  
   “BRIEF” – no (E banned).  
   “BRINY” – no (structure is B R I N Y; O missing).  
   Wait, the skeleton must include O.  
   Re-check: we must have O at 4, so word is B R I O _.  
   Real word: “BRION” is extremely obscure; more common is “BRIO” (only 4 letters).  
   Actually, the spelling “BRIO” is only four letters; we need five.  
   Perhaps “BRIOC” (no).  
   However, “BRIO” is pronounced “bree-oh,” and the usual 5-letter spelling is “BRIOU” (not standard).  
   Let me backtrack: the placement of O at 4 seems the only possibility.  
   A valid 5-letter word is “BRIOC,” but C is already banned (feedback: C(x)).  
   So we must choose another consonant for position 5 that makes a real word starting “BRIO”.  
   Checking a word list, “BRION” does exist (rare, but a valid proper noun).  
   Let’s try “BRION.”  

If “BRION” is rejected by the game, we’ll know we must revisit.  
But it fits all constraints.

From the new feedback (BRION → B ✓ R ✓ I − O − N x) we learn:

- B is now fixed at position 1 (it’s ✓).
- R is still fixed at position 2 (✓ again).
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- O is in the word but not at position 4.
- N is not in the word.

Re-summarise:

Current skeleton:

Known letters still to place:
- I (cannot be at 3) → must be at 5.
- O (cannot be at 4) → must be at 3.

But if O must be at 3 and I must be at 5, the skeleton becomes  
B R O _ I.

That leaves position 4 to fill.  
Letters already known absent: A, S, E, T, C, N.  
We need a fifth letter that hasn’t been tested and is still available.
