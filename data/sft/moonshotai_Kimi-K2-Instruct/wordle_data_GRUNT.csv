Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal opening word in Wordle should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
4. Use letters with good positional coverage

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- SLATE: Uses S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning
- AUDIO: Uses A, U, D, I, O - all vowels but lacks common consonants
- ADIEU: Uses A, D, I, E, U - similar to AUDIO

I'll choose CRANE as it's statistically one of the best starting words, covering high-frequency letters in good positions.

So far we have:

- Pattern: _ R _ N T
- Letters confirmed in their exact spots: R (2), N (4), T (5)
- Letters already eliminated (never appear anywhere): C, A, E, F, O, P, I

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? R ? N T, using only letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Remaining unused letters that could occupy positions 1 and 3:
Consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, Y  
Vowel left: U  

Quick scan of common 5-letter words:
- B R U N T  → BRUNT (fits, uses B and U)
- G R U N T  → GRUNT (fits, uses G and U)
- D R U N T  → DRUNT (invalid word)
- S R U N T  → SRUNT (invalid)
- M R U N T  → MRUNT (invalid)
- V R U N T  → VRUNT (invalid)

Between BRUNT and GRUNT, both are valid English words. BRUNT is slightly more common (meaning “the main impact or stress”), so I’ll pick that.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,GRUNT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal opening word in Wordle should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
4. Use letters with good positional coverage

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- SLATE: Uses S, L, A, T, E - similar reasoning
- AUDIO: Uses A, U, D, I, O - all vowels but lacks common consonants
- ADIEU: Uses A, D, I, E, U - similar to AUDIO

I'll choose CRANE as it's statistically one of the best starting words, covering high-frequency letters in good positions.

- R: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So far we know:
1. The word has R in position 2 and N in position 4.
2. The letters C, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern:
_ R _ N _

We also want to use new letters we haven't tested yet to maximize information. Good next letters to try would include S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, B, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit _ R _ N _:
- IRONY
- URINE
- ORGAN (but A is already excluded)
- BRAIN (but A is excluded)
- PRONE (but E is excluded)
- FRONT
- GRIND
- DRAIN (A excluded)

FRONT looks promising as it uses F, O, T - all new letters that haven't been tested yet and fit the pattern.

GRIND is another option, but FRONT seems slightly more common.
