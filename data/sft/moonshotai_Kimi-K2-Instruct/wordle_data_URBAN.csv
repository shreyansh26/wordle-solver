- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best approach is to make a strategic guess that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Include multiple vowels to narrow down vowel positions
3. Avoid rare letters initially

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess would combine these letters while forming a valid word.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It uses very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word
- The letters can form many other words depending on feedback

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the second guess.

From the new feedback on TRAIN:
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is still correctly placed in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but is NOT in position 3 (-)  
- I is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word and is correctly placed in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now: _ R _ _ N  
And the constraints are:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1 or 3)
2. Contains R (fixed in position 2)
3. Contains N (fixed in position 5)
4. Excludes: O, S, E, T, I

Possible positions for A: 4 or 5.  
But position 5 is already N, so A must be in position 4.

Therefore the pattern is: _ R _ A N

Letters still allowed (excluding used/excluded ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common letters in the first and third positions, good candidates are C, B, D, G, M, etc.

A common word fitting: B R A C N … no, that’s not a word.  
Try B R A C N → not valid.  
Try C R A C N → invalid.  
Try B R A C N → invalid.

Actually, the third position is still open (only 2 and 5 are fixed).  
Wait: pattern is _ R _ _ N with A somewhere in the word, not in 1 or 3, so A must be in 4.

So the pattern is: _ R _ A N

Possible first letters: common ones like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

A valid word: B R A C N → no.  
C R A C N → no.  
D R A C N → no.  
F R A C N → no.  
G R A C N → no.  
H R A C N → no.  
K R A C N → no.  
L R A C N → no.  
M R A C N → no.

Realizing I need to think of actual words.  
A common word fitting: B R A N N → but N is already used twice and invalid.  
Wait, the pattern is _ R _ A N.

Valid words:
- GRAIN → but I is excluded.  
- CRANE → E is excluded.  
- BRAND → fits! B R A N D  
- B R A N D → pattern B R A N D → positions: 1-B, 2-R, 3-A (but A was marked '-' for position 3 in TRAIN).  
Wait, no: in TRAIN, A was in position 3 and marked '-', meaning A is NOT in position 3, but it doesn’t say it must be in 4.  
But in the current pattern _ R _ _ N, A must be in 4 since 1 and 3 are excluded for A.

So word must be _ R _ A N.

Valid words: BRAND (but A is in position 3 → invalid since A was '-' in position 3), CRANE (E is invalid), GRAND (A in position 3 → invalid), etc.

Real issue: A must be in position 4.  
Looking for _ R _ A N:

- BRAND → A is in position 3 → invalid.  
- CRANE → E invalid.  
- CRANK → K is allowed. C R A N K → pattern C R A N K → A in 3 → invalid.  
Wait, this seems impossible.

Re-evaluate:  
From feedback:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.  
- So A must be in position 4.  
- Thus the word is: _ R _ A N.

Letters used/excluded: O, S, E, T, I are out.  
So possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words _ R _ A N:
- BRUAN → invalid.  
- CRUAN → invalid.  
- GRAAN → invalid.  
- GRAIN → I is excluded.  
- GRAMN → invalid.  
- PRANK → A is in position 3 → invalid.  
- FRANC → C is in position 5, but pattern is _ R _ A N → C must be in 3.

Wait, the only valid word seems to be GRAND, but A is in position 3 → invalid.

Realizing there might be no common words fitting _ R _ A N with these constraints.  
Alternative: maybe A is in position 2, but position 2 is R.

Thus, no valid position for A, which is impossible.  
Recheck: A is in word, not in position 1 (from AROSE), not in position 3 (from TRAIN), and position 2 is R, 5 is N.  
Thus A must be in position 4.

So word must be _ R _ A N.

Looking again:
- B R A C N → invalid.  
- C R A C N → invalid.  
- B R U A N → invalid.  
- C R U A N → invalid.  
- G R U A N → invalid.

- K R U A N → invalid.  
- M R U A N → invalid.  
- P R U A N → invalid.  
- B R A V N → invalid.  
- C R A V N → invalid.  
- G R A V N → invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, ""URBAN"" fits, but U is allowed and B, A, N are in the word.  
URBAN: U R B A N → positions: 1-U, 2-R, 3-B, 4-A, 5-N.  
- R is in position 2 ✓  
- N is in position 5 ✓  
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A was excluded only from 1 and 3)  
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, T, I)  
This is valid!

<guess>URBAN</guess>

Given the constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ N

- Must exclude O, S, E, T, I

- Valid word: U R B A N

- GRAMN → invalid.  
- PRANK → A is in position 3 → invalid.  
- FRANC → C is in position 5, but pattern is _ R _ A N → C must be in 3.

Wait, the only valid word seems to be GRAND, but A is in position 3 → invalid.

Realizing there might be no common words fitting _ R _ A N with these constraints.  
Alternative: maybe A is in position 2, but position 2 is R.

Thus, no valid position for A, which is impossible.  
Recheck: A is in word, not in position 1 (from AROSE), not in position 3 (from TRAIN), and position 2 is R, 5 is N.  
Thus A must be in position 4.

So word must be _ R _ A N.

Looking again:
- B R A C N → invalid.  
- C R A C N → invalid.  
- B R U A N → invalid.  
- C R U A N → invalid.  
- G R U A N → invalid.  
- D R U A N → invalid.  
- F R U A N → invalid.  
- H R U A N → invalid.  
- K R U A N → invalid.  
- M R U A N → invalid.  
- P R U A N → invalid.  
- B R A V N → invalid.  
- C R A V N → invalid.  
- G R A V N → invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, ""URBAN"" fits, but U is allowed and B, A, N are in the word.  
URBAN: U R B A N → positions: 1-U, 2-R, 3-B, 4-A, 5-N.  
- R is in position 2 ✓  
- N is in position 5 ✓  
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A was excluded only from 1 and 3)  
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, T, I)  
This is valid!

<guess>URBAN</guess>Given the constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ N
- Must contain A (not in position 1 or 3)
- Must exclude O, S, E, T, I
- Therefore A must be in position 4
- Valid word: U R B A N",Guess 3: URBAN -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) R(✓) B(✓) A(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
