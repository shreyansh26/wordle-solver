2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good coverage of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, L, N)
- Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a strong foundation to work from based on the feedback I receive.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (✓ at position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the word is of the form A _ _ _ _ and cannot contain R, O, S, E.

Next steps:
1. Keep A fixed in position 1.
2. Avoid all letters already eliminated (R, O, S, E).
3. Try a word that introduces several new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to test now: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A word like ""ADMIT"" uses:
- A fixed in position 1.
- New consonants D, M, T.
- New vowel I.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (R, O, S, E).

This seems like a solid second guess.

Current constraints (after Guess 1 and Guess 2):

1. Known pattern: A _ _ I T  (positions 1, 4, 5 are locked)
2. Letters NOT in the word (per x feedback): R, O, S, E, M
3. Letter D is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2 (because D got “-” feedback: in word, wrong spot).

So the word looks like:
A _ D I T   or   A _ _ D I T   … but since we already know position 5 is T, the only possible slots left for D are positions 2 or 3. However we also know D cannot be in position 2 (because it was marked “-” when it appeared in position 2 of ADMIT). Therefore D must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is almost forced:
A _ D I T

The blank (position 2) must be a letter that:
- Hasn’t appeared yet
- Isn’t among the eliminated letters (R, O, S, E, M)

Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels still available: U (I and A already placed)

Try a consonant that is common in the middle of words.

Let’s test “H” in position 2: A H D I T → check if “AHDIT” is a valid English word. It isn’t.

Try “C”: A C D I T → “ACDIT” – not valid.

Try “N”: A N D I T – not valid.

Try “L”: A L D I T – not a word.

Try “B”: A B D I T – “ABDIT” not found.

Wait, let’s instead use a valid word that fits A _ D I T. The only real 5-letter word with pattern A _ D I T is “AUDIT”.  
Check letters: A, U, D, I, T  
- A, I, T are already confirmed in positions 1,4,5.  
- D is confirmed present and must go in position 3 here (cannot be in 2).  
- U hasn’t been tested yet and is allowed.
