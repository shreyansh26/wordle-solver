Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving us good coverage for the first guess

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but **not** in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains **R** but **not** in position 2.
- The letters A, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Has R somewhere except the 2nd letter.
- Has none of A, O, S, E.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A candidate that uses R (not in position 2), includes I or U, and avoids the forbidden letters: **TRIUM** – but TRIUM is 5 letters and uses U and I. Wait, let’s check: T R I U M – R is in position 2, which is forbidden (feedback says R is in the wrong position, so it **can’t** be in position 2). 

Next candidate: **FRUIT** – F R U I T. R is in position 2 again, which is forbidden.

Try **CRIMP** – C R I M P. R is in position 2 again.

Try **DRIP** – only 4 letters.

Try **BRICK** – B R I C K. R in position 2 again.

Try **RIGHT** – R is in position 1, which is allowed. Let’s check letters: R I G H T. No A, O, S, E. R is in position 1 (allowed), and we haven’t used G or H yet, which could give us new info.

Another possibility: **PRINT** – P R I N T. R in position 2 is forbidden.

**GRIFT** – G R I F T. R in position 2 is forbidden.

**WRITH** – W R I T H. R in position 2 is forbidden.

**URBIC** – U R B I C. R in position 2 is forbidden.

**CURIO** – has O, which is forbidden.

**FURRY** – has R in position 4, which is allowed. F U R R Y. But R appears twice, which might not help much.

**CURVY** – C U R V Y. R in position 3, no forbidden letters. This seems good.

**CURVY**:
- C, U, R, V, Y.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2).

   ⇒ U is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   ⇒ R is in the word AND in position 3 (because the ✓ appeared in the 3rd slot).

So we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ R _ _
- Allowed letters so far: R (position 3), U (somewhere except position 2), plus any other letters except A, O, S, E, C, V, Y.
- Remaining useful consonants to try: T, N, L, D, P, H, etc.
- Remaining useful vowels: I (since U is already known to be present, and A, O, E are out).

A good next word should:
- Keep R in position 3.
- Include U in one of the allowed positions (1, 3, 4, or 5). (But 3 is already R, so 1, 4, or 5.)
- Introduce new common letters we haven’t tested yet.
