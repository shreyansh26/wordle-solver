For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
3. Doesn't repeat letters to test more unique letters

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I) and frequently appearing consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.). Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants, which should give good initial information about the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE we now know:

- R: NOT in the word (✗)
- O: IS in the word but NOT in position 3 (–)  
- S: NOT in the word (✗)
- E: NOT in the word (✗)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter O (since we know O is in the word).
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., avoids A, R, S, E).

Popular consonants still in play: T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.
Popular vowels still in play: I, U (O is already known to be present).

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Places O in position 2 or 4 (to test new placements).
- Uses new consonants and vowels not yet tested.

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (known to be in word, now testing position 2), I (new), N (new), T (new).
- Avoids A, R, S, E (all already eliminated).

Another candidate is ""CLOUD"":
- C (new), L (new), O (known, now testing position 3 — but wait, feedback said O is NOT in position 3, so CLOUD is bad because O is in position 3 here).

Thus, ""POINT"" is better because:
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 3).
- Uses 4 new letters (P, I, N, T) that haven’t been tested yet.

So my next guess is POINT.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
3. Doesn't repeat letters to test more unique letters

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I) and frequently appearing consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.). Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants, which should give good initial information about the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we now know:
- A: NOT in the word (✗)
- R: NOT in the word (✗)
- O: IS in the word but NOT in position 3 (–)  
- S: NOT in the word (✗)
- E: NOT in the word (✗)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter O (since we know O is in the word).
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., avoids A, R, S, E).

Popular consonants still in play: T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.
Popular vowels still in play: I, U (O is already known to be present).

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Places O in position 2 or 4 (to test new placements).
- Uses new consonants and vowels not yet tested.

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (known to be in word, now testing position 2), I (new), N (new), T (new).
- Avoids A, R, S, E (all already eliminated).

Another candidate is ""CLOUD"":
- C (new), L (new), O (known, now testing position 3 — but wait, feedback said O is NOT in position 3, so CLOUD is bad because O is in position 3 here).

Thus, ""POINT"" is better because:
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 3).
- Uses 4 new letters (P, I, N, T) that haven’t been tested yet.

So my next guess is POINT.

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback for POINT:
- P(x) → not in the word
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 2
- I(x) → not in the word
- N(✓) → N is in the word and is in position 4
- T(✓) → T is in the word and is in position 5

So the hidden word now looks like:
_ O _ N T
with positions 1 and 3 still unknown.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I.

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Vowels left to try: U (O is already fixed in position 2).

Good candidates for position 1 and 3 that use remaining letters:
- C, L, D, B, M, G, etc.

To maximize info, pick a word that:
1. Matches the pattern _ O _ N T.
2. Uses two new, different letters for positions 1 and 3, avoiding anything already eliminated.

A quick scan of common words ending in “ONT” with O in position 2:
- B O N N T (invalid, double N)
- C O U N T → C (new), O (correct), U (new), N (correct), T (correct)
- D O U N T (invalid, not a word)
- F O U N T (valid)
- G O U N T (invalid)
- M O U N T (valid)

Among these, “COUNT” and “MOUNT” are strong because they test the letter U in position 3, which is still unchecked. I’ll choose “MOUNT” as it’s common and tests M and U.

Word: M O U N T
