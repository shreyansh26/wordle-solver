### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A popular strategy is to use words with letters like A, E, R, T, L, S, N, etc. 

One of the most commonly recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels plus two very common consonants. This will give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of those letters.

To maximize new information, I need the next guess to use entirely different letters.  
A good set of fresh, common letters is: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.  
A balanced 5-letter word that uses five new, frequent letters is “UNTIL”.

Letters in UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L – none overlap with the already-eliminated A, R, O, S, E.

From the new feedback:

- U is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 2.
- T is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- L is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
U N _ _ _

The remaining letters we can use must exclude A, R, O, S, E, T, L and we know I must appear somewhere among positions 3-5.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Y …  
Some quick candidates:
- UNPIN (P in 3, I in 4) – but I can’t be in 4.
- UNHIP (H in 3, I in 4) – same problem.
- UNIFY (I in 3, F in 4, Y in 5) – satisfies I in 3.
- UNFIX (I in 3, F in 4, X in 5) – X is rarer but possible.
- UNDID (I in 4 again – no good).

“UNIFY” keeps I in position 3, uses common letters, and gives us two fresh consonants (F, Y) to test.

Therefore, next guess: UNIFY
