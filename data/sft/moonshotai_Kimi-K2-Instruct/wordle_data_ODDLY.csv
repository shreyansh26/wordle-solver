For the first guess, we want a word that will give us the most information possible. This means using common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. The best strategy is to use letters that are most frequent in English words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L).

A good first guess would be a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular choices among Wordle players include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's a valid 5-letter word that contains 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E), giving us the maximum chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Every letter in RAISE was marked “x,” so the secret word contains none of R, A, I, S, or E.  
That rules out many common letters, so we now want a fresh set that still covers other frequent consonants and vowels. Good remaining frequent letters include T, N, L, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced next guess that uses five new high-frequency letters without any repeats is:

- TOUND (uses T, O, U, N, D) – but “TOUND” isn’t a recognized English word.

From the feedback so far:

1. RAISE → all letters x ⇒ word has none of R, A, I, S, E.  
2. CLOUD → C(x) L(-) O(-) U(x) D(-) ⇒ word contains L, O, D but each is in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in: L, O, D  
- Letters definitely out: R, A, I, S, E, C, U  
- Positions we know:
  – L is NOT in position 2
  – O is NOT in position 3
  – D is NOT in position 5

We want a valid 5-letter word that uses L, O, D each exactly once and avoids all the banned letters. We also want to test some fresh consonants to narrow things further.

A good candidate is “MOLDY”:
- Uses M, O, L, D, Y  
- Contains L, O, D as required  
- Uses new letters M and Y  
- No banned letters

Let’s check positions:
- O will be in position 2 (but feedback says O is in word but wrong position, so this is acceptable because we’re moving O away from position 3).  
- L will be in position 3 (feedback says L is in word but wrong position, and position 2 was its previous wrong spot, so this is fine – we’re testing a new spot).  
- D will be in position 4 (feedback said D is in word but wrong position, and previously it was in position 5, so position 4 is new).

Thus “MOLDY” satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, M  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but currently in wrong positions):
   - O, L, D  
3. One letter is already locked in the right spot:
   - Y is in position 5: _ _ _ _ Y  

So the pattern is: ? ? ? ? Y, and it must contain O, L, D (each exactly once) and no banned letters.

Possible positions for O, L, D among the first four slots without repeating previous wrong positions:
- O was in slot 3 (MOLDY) and earlier in slot 3 (CLOUD) → O cannot be in slot 3 → O must be in 1, 2, or 4.
- L was in slot 3 (MOLDY) and slot 2 (CLOUD) → L cannot be in 2 or 3 → L must be in 1 or 4.
- D was in slot 4 (MOLDY) and slot 5 (CLOUD) → D cannot be in 5 (already Y is there) or 4 → D must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We also need a new consonant for the remaining slot; available high-frequency consonants not yet tried include N, T, H, G, B, F, etc.

Let’s list valid placements:
- If D is in 1: D _ _ _ Y
- If D is in 2: _ D _ _ Y
- If D is in 3: _ _ D _ Y

Possible word constructions:
- D O _ _ Y  → need L in 3 or 4, but 4 is already wrong for D, and O cannot be 3. So D O L _ Y (slot 4 must be new consonant) → D O L (?) Y → need one consonant not used yet. Let’s try N → DOLNY – not a word.  
- D L O _ Y → D L O (?) Y → need consonant → D L O (N) Y → DLONY – not a word.  
- L O D _ Y → L O D (?) Y → need consonant → L O D (N) Y → LODNY – not a word.  
- O L D _ Y → O L D (?) Y → need consonant → O L D (N) Y → OLDNY – not a word.  
- D _ L _ Y → D (O) L (?) Y → need consonant → D O L (N) Y (same issue).  
- _ L D _ Y → (O) L D (?) Y → O L D (N) Y (same).  

Wait, let’s try D in slot 2:
- _ D _ _ Y → put O and L in remaining slots (1 and 3 or 4):
   - O D L _ Y → need consonant in 4 → OD L (?) Y → OD L (N) Y → ODLNY – not valid.
   - L D O _ Y → need consonant in 4 → LD O (N) Y → LDONY – not valid.
   - _ D _ O Y → but then we have O in 4 which was not yet ruled out (only 3 was bad), and we still need L. Let’s try _ D L O Y – but that would put O in 5, but 5 is Y. Not possible.
   - _ D O _ Y → valid: _ D O _ Y → need L in 1 or 4:
      - L D O _ Y → need consonant in 4 → L D O (N) Y → LDONY – not valid.
      - _ D O L Y → need consonant in 1 → ? D O L Y → possible letters left: N, T, H, G, B, F, etc. Try N → N D O L Y – not a word. Try B → B D O L Y – not a word. Try F → F D O L Y – not a word. Try T → T D O L Y – not a word. Try H → H D O L Y – not a word. Try G → G D O L Y – not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Let me re-examine placements with remaining slots.

Alternative: D in slot 3:
- _ _ D _ Y → slots 1, 2, 4 need O, L and one new consonant.
   - L O D _ Y → need consonant in 4 → L O D (N) Y – LODNY – invalid.
   - O L D _ Y → need consonant in 4 → O L D (N) Y – OLDNY – invalid.
   - _ L D O Y – but O cannot be 5 (already Y), so this is invalid as O is must be in 1-4 and not 3.  
   - _ O D L Y – but L must be in 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are invalid), so L in 4: _ O D L Y – need consonant in 1 → ? O D L Y → try B, F, N, T, H, G.

Let’s list possible English words fitting the pattern and constraints.

Looking up 5-letter words ending with Y that contain O, L, D (each once) and no banned letters:

Possible candidates:
- FOLLY (but repeats L twice – invalid)
- GODLY – contains G, O, D, L, Y. This fits: O, L, D each once, Y at 5, no banned letters.
Check positions:
   - O in 2: was previously bad in slot 3 (CLOUD, MOLDY), slot 3 was bad, slot 2 is new – ok.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that will give us the most information possible. This means using common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. The best strategy is to use letters that are most frequent in English words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L).

A good first guess would be a word that contains several of these common letters. Some popular choices among Wordle players include:

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's a valid 5-letter word that contains 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E), giving us the maximum chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Every letter in RAISE was marked “x,” so the secret word contains none of R, A, I, S, or E.  
That rules out many common letters, so we now want a fresh set that still covers other frequent consonants and vowels. Good remaining frequent letters include T, N, L, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced next guess that uses five new high-frequency letters without any repeats is:

- TOUND (uses T, O, U, N, D) – but “TOUND” isn’t a recognized English word.
- CLOUD (uses C, L, O, U, D) – this is a valid word and hits five new common letters.

So we’ll go with CLOUD.

<guess>CLOUD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) U(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. RAISE → all letters x ⇒ word has none of R, A, I, S, E.  
2. CLOUD → C(x) L(-) O(-) U(x) D(-) ⇒ word contains L, O, D but each is in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in: L, O, D  
- Letters definitely out: R, A, I, S, E, C, U  
- Positions we know:
  – L is NOT in position 2
  – O is NOT in position 3
  – D is NOT in position 5

We want a valid 5-letter word that uses L, O, D each exactly once and avoids all the banned letters. We also want to test some fresh consonants to narrow things further.

A good candidate is “MOLDY”:
- Uses M, O, L, D, Y  
- Contains L, O, D as required  
- Uses new letters M and Y  
- No banned letters

Let’s check positions:
- O will be in position 2 (but feedback says O is in word but wrong position, so this is acceptable because we’re moving O away from position 3).  
- L will be in position 3 (feedback says L is in word but wrong position, and position 2 was its previous wrong spot, so this is fine – we’re testing a new spot).  
- D will be in position 4 (feedback said D is in word but wrong position, and previously it was in position 5, so position 4 is new).

Thus “MOLDY” satisfies all constraints.

New deductions from Guess 4:

1. Letters still OUT: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, M, G  
2. Locked-in positions:  
   - D is in position 3 (✓)  
   - L is in position 4 (✓)  
   - Y is in position 5 (✓)  
3. Remaining letters to place: O must be in the word (from earlier feedback), yet it was marked “-” in positions 2 (GODLY) and 3 (MOLDY).  
   Hence O cannot be in slot 2 or 3. The only open slots now are 1 and 2; but slot 3 is already D, so O must be in slot 1 or 2.  
   - Slot 2 was just tested with O in GODLY (it was “-”), so O cannot be in slot 2.  
   Therefore O must be in slot 1: O _ D L Y

The only letter left to fill slot 2 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.  
Available consonants (not in banned list and not yet used): B, F, H, K, N, P, T, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form O ? D L Y.

Looking up such words:  
- ODDLY – but D is already in slot 3 and repeating it would violate single-use.  
- OBDLY – invalid  
- OFDLY – invalid  
- OHDLY – invalid  
- OKDLY – invalid  
- ONDLY – invalid  
- OTDLY – invalid  
- OWDLY – invalid  

Wait, the only recognizable English word fitting the pattern is “ODDLY,” yet it repeats D, which we cannot have since we know D is only once in the word (it was marked ✓ in slot 3).  

Rechecking lists, “OADLY” etc., are not words.  

The only valid choice appears to be “ODDLY,” but that repeats D.  
However, in Wordle rules, the target word can have duplicate letters even if our previous guesses didn’t show them. The feedback so far does not preclude an extra D in slot 2; the single D already confirmed in slot 3 does not forbid another D elsewhere unless feedback explicitly says “only one.”  
So “ODDLY” is actually a valid candidate.

Let’s verify:  
Pattern O D D L Y:  
- slot 1: O – ok (new position)  
- slot 2: D – ok (new position)  
- slot 3: D – already confirmed ✓  
- slot 4: L – confirmed ✓  
- slot 5: Y – confirmed ✓  

Therefore, the only possible word left is ODDLY.
