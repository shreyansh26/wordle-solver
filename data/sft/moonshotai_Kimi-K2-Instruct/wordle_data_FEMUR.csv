For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear frequently in English words, increasing the chance of hitting some correct letters early
- It can help narrow down possibilities quickly

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (position 1) = x → A is NOT in the word at all.
- R (position 2) = - → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O (position 3) = x → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S (position 4) = x → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E (position 5) = - → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S
- Letters we must use (somewhere): R, E
- R cannot be 2nd, E cannot be 5th.

Next step: pick a word that includes R and E in new positions and avoids A, O, S.

Possible pattern: _ R _ _ E is invalid (E must move from 5th), so we need to place E somewhere else (1-4) and R somewhere else (1,3,4,5).

A good next-guess word that uses common consonants while preserving R and E is ""TREND"":
- T and N are common consonants.
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (invalid per feedback) → so scratch TREND.

Another candidate: ""ENTER"":
- E (1) and E (5) → duplicates E, and E is 5th (invalid).

Candidate: ""PERCH"":
- E (2), R (3) – both positions are new and acceptable.
- Adds P, C, H, common consonants.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, P, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, R  

Current positions:
- E: must be in position 2 (from PERCH feedback).  
- R: must appear somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5.  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R and E again if needed (but we have only one E locked in position 2).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E fixed in position 2  
- R placed somewhere among positions 1, 4, or 5  
- Other three letters from the allowed list

Candidate words that fit:
- R E ? ? ?  → R must be in position 1 (allowed).  
  Example: REBEL → but L is allowed, check: R E B E L → positions: 1(R), 2(E), 3(B), 4(E), 5(L). This has two E’s, which is acceptable if the word allows it.  
  But let’s look for a word with only one E (since we don’t know the word has two).

- ? E ? ? R → R in position 5 (allowed).  
  Example: VENUE → but U appears twice.  
  Example: TENET → but T and N are allowed, positions: T(1) E(2) N(3) E(4) T(5) – has two E’s and two T’s, not ideal.

- ? E R ? ? → R in position 3 is invalid (from PERCH feedback R was (-) in position 3).  

- ? E ? R ? → R in position 4 (allowed).  
  Example: BERET → but has two E’s and T is allowed.  
  Example: MERGE → G is allowed, positions: M(1) E(2) R(3) G(4) E(5) – R is in position 3 which is invalid.

- ? E ? ? ? with R in position 1:  
  Example: R E M I T → positions: R(1) E(2) M(3) I(4) T(5). All letters allowed and positions for R and E are valid.  
  This seems good.

  Example: VENUE → but U appears twice.  
  Example: TENET → but T and N are allowed, positions: T(1) E(2) N(3) E(4) T(5) – has two E’s and two T’s, not ideal.

- ? E R ? ? → R in position 3 is invalid (from PERCH feedback R was (-) in position 3).  

- ? E ? R ? → R in position 4 (allowed).  
  Example: BERET → but has two E’s and T is allowed.  
  Example: MERGE → G is allowed, positions: M(1) E(2) R(3) G(4) E(5) – R is in position 3 which is invalid.

- ? E ? ? ? with R in position 1:  
  Example: R E M I T → positions: R(1) E(2) M(3) I(4) T(5). All letters allowed and positions for R and E are valid.  
  This seems good.

Let’s confirm REMIT:
- R in 1 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (locked)  
- M, I, T are all allowed consonants  
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, C, H)  
- Valid English word

Let's consolidate everything we know.

Letters NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, P, C, H, I, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 2), R (somewhere else), M (somewhere)

Positions we know:
- Position 2 is E (✓ from PERCH)  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE, PERCH, REMIT)  
- M is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from REMIT: M was in position 3 but gave ✓, meaning it is in the word – but since it didn't get ✓ in position 3, it must be elsewhere)

So the word must have:
- E in position 2  
- R must be in position 4 or 5  
- M must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3)  
- Avoid all forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, C, H, I, T)

Valid letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R, M, E

We need to form a 5-letter word with:
E in position 2  
R in 4 or 5  
M in 1, 4, or 5  
No forbidden letters  

Let's try positions:
Case 1: R in position 4
Then M must be in position 1 or 5.  
If M is in 1: M E _ R _ (positions 3 and 5 need letters from allowed list)  
Possible letters for position 3 and 5: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Example: M E R R Y – but R is duplicated and Y is allowed. However, we don't know if R is duplicated.  
Another: M E D G E – but E is duplicated and we don't know if the word has two E's.  
Let's try unique letters: M E R L Y – R is in position 3, but we need R in position 4.  
Wait, if R is in 4, then pattern is M E _ R _.  
Possible: M E N R Y – but N and Y allowed. Is MENRY a word? No.  
M E L R Y – no.  
M E R L Y – R is in 3, not 4.  
This seems tricky.

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then M must be in position 1 or 4.  
Subcase 2a: M in 1  
Pattern: M E _ _ R  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed list (B, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  
Example: M E N D R – but D is allowed. Is MENDR a word? No.  
M E L D R – no.  
M E G R R – no.  
M E G A R – but A is forbidden.  
M E N U R – U allowed, but MENUR isn't a word.  
M E R G R – R duplicated, position 4.  

Subcase 2b: M in 4  
Pattern: _ E M _ R  
Need letters for positions 1 and 3 from allowed list.  
Example: B E M E R – E duplicated.  
F E M U R – F, U, R allowed. FEMUR is a valid word.  
Let's check:  
F E M U R  
- E in 2 (✓)  
- R in 5 (allowed)  
- M in 3 (but from REMIT, M was in 3 and got ✓, meaning M is in the word – but we don't know if it's in position 3. Since REMIT gave M(✓), it confirms M is in the word somewhere, but position 3 is not confirmed. However, since M got ✓ in position 3 in REMIT, it means M is in the word AND in position 3. Wait, no: M in REMIT was in position 3 and gave ✓, which means M is in the word AND in position 3. But from REMIT, M was in position 3 and gave ✓, so M is in position 3. But from PERCH, M was not used, so no info on M's position except from REMIT.  

Wait, re-reading REMIT feedback: REMIT -> R(-) E(✓) M(✓) I(x) T(x)  
This means:  
- R is not in position 1 (but we already knew that from earlier)  
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- M is in position 3 (✓) – because if M were elsewhere and not in 3, it would have been (-)  

Thus, M is in position 3.  
But then the word must be: _ E M _ _  
R must be in position 4 or 5  
No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, C, H, I, T)  

Possible pattern: _ E M _ _ with R in 4 or 5  
Examples:  
- _ E M R _  
  Need letter for position 1 and 5.  
  Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
  Example: D E M R Y – but is DEMRY a word? No.  
  F E M R Y – no.  
  G E M R Y – no.  
  B E M R Y – no.  

- _ E M _ R  
  Need letter for position 1 and 4.  
  Example: G E M M R – but M would be duplicated.  
  F E M U R – but M is in 3, U in 4, R in 5. FEMUR is a valid word.  
  Let's check FEMUR:  
  F E M U R  
  - E in 2 (✓)  
  - M in 3 (✓ from REMIT)  
  - R in 5 (allowed)  
  - F and U are new allowed letters  
  No forbidden letters.  

This seems to fit all constraints.
