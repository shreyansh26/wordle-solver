For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me identify common letters and their positions efficiently. The word should contain frequently used letters in English to maximize the chances of getting hits. Some common strategies include:

1. Using a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Avoiding words with repeated letters
3. Choosing a word that gives good coverage of letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good starting word would include several of these.

Common strong first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, ABOUT, or AUDIO. These contain multiple high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This should give good information about 5 very common letters.

So far we know:  
- S is in the correct first position.  
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.  

That leaves 4 unknown positions (2-5).  
Letters we still allow: basically everything except L, A, T, E.  

We want a second guess that keeps S in slot 1, uses as many new high-frequency letters as possible, and avoids the four letters already ruled out.  

Common remaining consonants to test: R, N, H, C, D, M, P, B, K, F, G, Y, W, V, etc.  
Vowels still available: I, O, U.

A good “coverage” word that fits S _ _ _ _ and introduces several new high-frequency letters is “SHORN” (S, H, O, R, N).  
- First letter locked in as S.  
- H, O, R, N are all common and not yet tested.  

Let’s go with SHORN.
