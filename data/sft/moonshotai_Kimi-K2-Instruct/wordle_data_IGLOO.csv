For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. 

Some good starting words include: ARISE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

The feedback from CRANE shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word. This means I should avoid all of those letters entirely and choose a word that uses completely different letters.

From the feedback so far:
- CRANE gave all x’s → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- SLUMP gave L(-) and the rest x → L is in the word but in the wrong position, and S, U, M, P are not in the word.

So the letters we now know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.

The only confirmed letter is L, which is in the word but not in the 2nd position.

I need to pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L (but not in position 2).
2. Uses none of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tried.

Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll look for a word with L plus some of these. A good candidate is “BUILT” but U and T are both excluded. “GLOVE” has O and V, but O is still possible. Wait, E is excluded. So “GLOVE” is out.

Let me pick “LIGHT” — but G, H, I, T are okay, and L is in it (not in position 2). However, does this maximize info? Maybe “DOILY” but Y might be too rare.

Actually, “FLING” comes to mind — F, L, I, N, G. But N is excluded. “FOLLY” has O and Y, but double L is allowed, and O is still possible. But we want to test new positions for L.

Another option: “BLOKE” — but O, K, E, B, L. E is excluded. “DWELL” — D, W, E, L, L. E excluded.

“LOWLY” — L, O, W, L, Y. O and W and Y are new, L is in it (positions 1 and 4). This could work to test L in positions 1 and 4.

But is there a word with L not in position 2 and using fresh letters? “GLINT” — G, L, I, N, T. N is excluded.

“GUILD” — G, U, I, L, D. U is excluded.

“FLICK” — F, L, I, C, K. C is excluded.

“BLIMP” — B, L, I, M, P. M and P excluded.

“CLOTH” — C excluded.

“BLOCK” — C and K excluded.

“DWELL” — E excluded.

“GLOOM” — M excluded.

“LOWLY” seems the best so far, as it has L in positions 1 and 4 (not 2), and introduces O, W, Y.

But let me think of another: “BILGE” — B, I, L, G, E. E excluded.

“FILMY” — M excluded.

“HILLY” — H, I, L, L, Y. This uses H, I, Y, and L in positions 3 and 4 (not 2). This seems good.

I’ll go with “HILLY”.

A good choice would be a word like ""SLUMP"" or ""BUILT"".

Uses other common letters not yet tried.\n\nAvailable letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nI’ll look for a word with L plus some of these. A good candidate is “BUILT” but U and T are both excluded. “GLOVE” has O and V, but O is still possible. Wait, E is excluded. So “GLOVE” is out.\n\nLet me pick “LIGHT” — but G, H, I, T are okay, and L is in it (not in position 2). However, does this maximize info? Maybe “DOILY” but Y might be too rare.\n\nActually, “FLING” comes to mind — F, L, I, N, G. But N is excluded. “FOLLY” has O and Y, but double L is allowed, and O is still possible. But we want to test new positions for L.\n\nAnother option: “BLOKE” — but O, K, E, B, L. E is excluded. “DWELL” — D, W, E, L, L. E excluded.\n\n“LOWLY” — L, O, W, L, Y. O and W and Y are new, L is in it (positions 1 and 4). This could work to test L in positions 1 and 4.\n\nBut is there a word with L not in position 2 and using fresh letters? “GLINT” — G, L, I, N, T. N is excluded.\n\n“GUILD” — G, U, I, L, D. U is excluded.\n\n“FLICK” — F, L, I, C, K. C is excluded.\n\n“BLIMP” — B, L, I, M, P. M and P excluded.\n\n“CLOTH” — C excluded.\n\n“BLOCK” — C and K excluded.\n\n“DWELL” — E excluded.\n\n“GLOOM” — M excluded.\n\n“LOWLY” seems the best so far, as it has L in positions 1 and 4 (not 2), and introduces O, W, Y.\n\nBut let me think of another: “BILGE” — B, I, L, G, E. E excluded.\n\n“FILMY” — M excluded.\n\n“HILLY” — H, I, L, L, Y. This uses H, I, Y, and L in positions 3 and 4 (not 2).

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. 

Some good starting words include: ARISE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from CRANE shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word. This means I should avoid all of those letters entirely and choose a word that uses completely different letters.

Good letters to include now are ones that weren’t in CRANE. Some common remaining letters are S, T, O, I, L, U, M, P, D, B, etc. I want to pick a word that uses a fresh set of common letters to maximize information gain. A good choice would be a word like ""SLUMP"" or ""BUILT"". I'll go with ""SLUMP"" as it has S, L, U, M, P which are all new and common.

<guess>SLUMP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- CRANE gave all x’s → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- SLUMP gave L(-) and the rest x → L is in the word but in the wrong position, and S, U, M, P are not in the word.

So the letters we now know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.

The only confirmed letter is L, which is in the word but not in the 2nd position.

I need to pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L (but not in position 2).
2. Uses none of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tried.

Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll look for a word with L plus some of these. A good candidate is “BUILT” but U and T are both excluded. “GLOVE” has O and V, but O is still possible. Wait, E is excluded. So “GLOVE” is out.

Let me pick “LIGHT” — but G, H, I, T are okay, and L is in it (not in position 2). However, does this maximize info? Maybe “DOILY” but Y might be too rare.

Actually, “FLING” comes to mind — F, L, I, N, G. But N is excluded. “FOLLY” has O and Y, but double L is allowed, and O is still possible. But we want to test new positions for L.

Another option: “BLOKE” — but O, K, E, B, L. E is excluded. “DWELL” — D, W, E, L, L. E excluded.

“LOWLY” — L, O, W, L, Y. O and W and Y are new, L is in it (positions 1 and 4). This could work to test L in positions 1 and 4.

But is there a word with L not in position 2 and using fresh letters? “GLINT” — G, L, I, N, T. N is excluded.

“GUILD” — G, U, I, L, D. U is excluded.

“FLICK” — F, L, I, C, K. C is excluded.

“BLIMP” — B, L, I, M, P. M and P excluded.

“CLOTH” — C excluded.

“BLOCK” — C and K excluded.

“DWELL” — E excluded.

“GLOOM” — M excluded.

“LOWLY” seems the best so far, as it has L in positions 1 and 4 (not 2), and introduces O, W, Y.

But let me think of another: “BILGE” — B, I, L, G, E. E excluded.

“FILMY” — M excluded.

“HILLY” — H, I, L, L, Y. This uses H, I, Y, and L in positions 3 and 4 (not 2). This seems good.

I’ll go with “HILLY”.

<guess>HILLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: HILLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) L(✓) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. CRANE – all letters are **not in** the word (C, R, A, N, E).
2. SLUMP – L is in the word but **wrong position**, and S, U, M, P are **not in**.
3. HILLY – L is in the word and **correct in third position (✓)**.  
   I is in the word but **wrong position**.  
   H and Y are **not in**.

So far, we know:

- L is **correctly placed in position 3** (✓).
- I is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- Letters **eliminated**: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y.

Available letters (not eliminated):  
B, D, F, G, I, K, O, T, V, W, and of course L.

We need a word that:
- Has L in position 3 ( _ _ L _ _ ).
- Contains I somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only the available letters.

Possible words meeting these:
- BUILT – but U is eliminated.
- GUILD – U eliminated.
- CHILD – C, H eliminated.
- FIELD – E eliminated.
- FLICK – C eliminated.
- FLINT – N eliminated.
- VIGIL – I is repeated, but we don’t know if I can appear twice.
- TWILL – T, W, I, L, L – I in position 3 is already L, so I would have to be elsewhere. This has I in position 2, but we know I is **not in position 2** from HILLY feedback.
- GLINT – N eliminated.
- BILGE – E, G are okay, but I is in position 2 (invalid).
- BLIMP – M, P eliminated.
- FLING – N eliminated.
- FLIRT – R eliminated.
- OWL – too short.
- OIL – too short.
- DILLY – Y eliminated.
- FILLY – Y eliminated.
- WILLY – Y eliminated.

Only one I remains, and it must be placed in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try **GUILT** – but U is eliminated.

**FLINT** – N eliminated.

**TWILL** – I is in position 2 (invalid).

**BUILT** – U eliminated.

**FIELD** – E eliminated.

**FLICK** – C eliminated.

**FLING** – N eliminated.

**VIGIL** – I appears twice, but we have no info about duplicates.

**GILLS** – S eliminated.

**FOLLY** – O is okay, Y eliminated.

**POLLY** – P eliminated.

**DOLLY** – Y eliminated.

**TILLY** – Y eliminated.

**WILLY** – Y eliminated.

Wait, let’s list exact structure: _ _ L _ _

We need I in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- **FILMS** – M, S eliminated.
- **FI**L**M** – M eliminated.
- **FIL**O** – O is okay, but FILO might not be a word.
- **FIL**T** – not a word.
- **F**I**L**E**D** – 5 letters: F, I, L, E, D. E eliminated.
- **F**I**L**M**S** – M, S eliminated.
- **T**I**L**D**E** – E eliminated.
- **T**I**L**T**S** – S eliminated.
- **W**I**L**D** – too short.
- **W**I**L**D**O** – too long.
- **W**I**L**L**S** – S eliminated.
- **B**I**L**K** – too short.
- **B**I**L**L** – too short.
- **G**I**L**D** – G, I, L, D. This is a valid 4-letter word, but we need 5 letters.
- **G**I**L**T** – too short.
- **G**I**L**L** – too short.
- **B**I**L**T** – too short.

Actually, let’s think of 5-letter words with L in position 3 and I elsewhere:

- **BUILT** – invalid (U).
- **FLINT** – invalid (N).
- **FLIRT** – invalid (R).
- **VIGIL** – invalid (G acceptable, but I twice, and overall structure).
- **TILDE** – invalid (E).

- **FLOSS** – invalid (S).
- **BLOOM** – invalid (M).
- **BLOOD** – valid: B, L, O, O, D. But L must be in position 3, and this has L in position 2. Invalid structure.

Another candidate: **BILBO** – but O is okay, B is okay, I is not in position 2, and this has I in position 2. Invalid.

**GILDS** – S eliminated.

**GILLY** – Y eliminated.

**FIXIT** – X not considered.

**FIJIS** – S eliminated.

Wait, let’s re-examine available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, O, T, V, W, L.

We need _ _ L _ _ with I somewhere in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:

- **BOWEL** – E eliminated.
- **BOTEL** – E eliminated.
- **DOWEL** – E eliminated.
- **FOGEL** – E eliminated.
- **GOWEL** – not a word.

- **TILTED** – E eliminated.
- **TILTED** – too long.
- **VIGIL** – G, I, V, I, L. I appears twice, L in position 5 (but L must be in position 3). Invalid structure.

- **VOILE** – E eliminated.
- **VOLKS** – S eliminated.
- **VOLTA** – A eliminated.
- **VOLTE** – E eliminated.
- **VOLTI** – I in position 5, L in position 3. This seems valid: V, O, L, T, I. All letters are allowed (V, O, L, T, I not eliminated). I is in position 5 (allowed), L is in position 3 (correct). This is a valid word: **VOLTI**.

Let me confirm:
- V: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (correct).
- T: allowed.
- I: allowed, and in position 5 (not 2, so okay).

This seems to be the only viable word left.We now know:
- L is fixed in position 3 (✓).
- I is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, O, T, V, W, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- L in position 3 (_ _ L _ _).
- I somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Only unused letters.

A valid word meeting these constraints is **VOLTI**.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,IGLOO,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. 

Some good starting words include: ARISE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from CRANE shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word. This means I should avoid all of those letters entirely and choose a word that uses completely different letters.

Good letters to include now are ones that weren’t in CRANE. Some common remaining letters are S, T, O, I, L, U, M, P, D, B, etc. I want to pick a word that uses a fresh set of common letters to maximize information gain. A good choice would be a word like ""SLUMP"" or ""BUILT"". I'll go with ""SLUMP"" as it has S, L, U, M, P which are all new and common.

<guess>SLUMP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- CRANE gave all x’s → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- SLUMP gave L(-) and the rest x → L is in the word but in the wrong position, and S, U, M, P are not in the word.

So the letters we now know are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.

The only confirmed letter is L, which is in the word but not in the 2nd position.

I need to pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L (but not in position 2).
2. Uses none of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tried.

Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll look for a word with L plus some of these. A good candidate is “BUILT” but U and T are both excluded. “GLOVE” has O and V, but O is still possible. Wait, E is excluded. So “GLOVE” is out.

Let me pick “LIGHT” — but G, H, I, T are okay, and L is in it (not in position 2). However, does this maximize info? Maybe “DOILY” but Y might be too rare.

Actually, “FLING” comes to mind — F, L, I, N, G. But N is excluded. “FOLLY” has O and Y, but double L is allowed, and O is still possible. But we want to test new positions for L.

Another option: “BLOKE” — but O, K, E, B, L. E is excluded. “DWELL” — D, W, E, L, L. E excluded.

“LOWLY” — L, O, W, L, Y. O and W and Y are new, L is in it (positions 1 and 4). This could work to test L in positions 1 and 4.

But is there a word with L not in position 2 and using fresh letters? “GLINT” — G, L, I, N, T. N is excluded.

“GUILD” — G, U, I, L, D. U is excluded.

“FLICK” — F, L, I, C, K. C is excluded.

“BLIMP” — B, L, I, M, P. M and P excluded.

“CLOTH” — C excluded.

“BLOCK” — C and K excluded.

“DWELL” — E excluded.

“GLOOM” — M excluded.

“LOWLY” seems the best so far, as it has L in positions 1 and 4 (not 2), and introduces O, W, Y.

But let me think of another: “BILGE” — B, I, L, G, E. E excluded.

“FILMY” — M excluded.

“HILLY” — H, I, L, L, Y. This uses H, I, Y, and L in positions 3 and 4 (not 2). This seems good.

I’ll go with “HILLY”.

<guess>HILLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: HILLY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) L(✓) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. CRANE – all letters are **not in** the word (C, R, A, N, E).
2. SLUMP – L is in the word but **wrong position**, and S, U, M, P are **not in**.
3. HILLY – L is in the word and **correct in third position (✓)**.  
   I is in the word but **wrong position**.  
   H and Y are **not in**.

So far, we know:

- L is **correctly placed in position 3** (✓).
- I is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- Letters **eliminated**: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y.

Available letters (not eliminated):  
B, D, F, G, I, K, O, T, V, W, and of course L.

We need a word that:
- Has L in position 3 ( _ _ L _ _ ).
- Contains I somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only the available letters.

Possible words meeting these:
- BUILT – but U is eliminated.
- GUILD – U eliminated.
- CHILD – C, H eliminated.
- FIELD – E eliminated.
- FLICK – C eliminated.
- FLINT – N eliminated.
- VIGIL – I is repeated, but we don’t know if I can appear twice.
- TWILL – T, W, I, L, L – I in position 3 is already L, so I would have to be elsewhere. This has I in position 2, but we know I is **not in position 2** from HILLY feedback.
- GLINT – N eliminated.
- BILGE – E, G are okay, but I is in position 2 (invalid).
- BLIMP – M, P eliminated.
- FLING – N eliminated.
- FLIRT – R eliminated.
- OWL – too short.
- OIL – too short.
- DILLY – Y eliminated.
- FILLY – Y eliminated.
- WILLY – Y eliminated.

Only one I remains, and it must be placed in 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try **GUILT** – but U is eliminated.

**FLINT** – N eliminated.

**TWILL** – I is in position 2 (invalid).

**BUILT** – U eliminated.

**FIELD** – E eliminated.

**FLICK** – C eliminated.

**FLING** – N eliminated.

**VIGIL** – I appears twice, but we have no info about duplicates.

**GILLS** – S eliminated.

**FOLLY** – O is okay, Y eliminated.

**POLLY** – P eliminated.

**DOLLY** – Y eliminated.

**TILLY** – Y eliminated.

**WILLY** – Y eliminated.

Wait, let’s list exact structure: _ _ L _ _

We need I in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible candidates:
- **FILMS** – M, S eliminated.
- **FI**L**M** – M eliminated.
- **FIL**O** – O is okay, but FILO might not be a word.
- **FIL**T** – not a word.
- **F**I**L**E**D** – 5 letters: F, I, L, E, D. E eliminated.
- **F**I**L**M**S** – M, S eliminated.

- **B**I**L**K** – too short.
- **B**I**L**L** – too short.
- **G**I**L**D** – G, I, L, D. This is a valid 4-letter word, but we need 5 letters.
- **G**I**L**T** – too short.
- **G**I**L**L** – too short.
- **B**I**L**T** – too short.

Actually, let’s think of 5-letter words with L in position 3 and I elsewhere:

- **BUILT** – invalid (U).
- **FLINT** – invalid (N).
- **FLIRT** – invalid (R).
- **VIGIL** – invalid (G acceptable, but I twice, and overall structure).

- **VOLTE** – E eliminated.
- **VOLTI** – I in position 5, L in position 3. This seems valid: V, O, L, T, I. All letters are allowed (V, O, L, T, I not eliminated). I is in position 5 (allowed), L is in position 3 (correct). This is a valid word: **VOLTI**.

Let me confirm:
- V: allowed.
- O: allowed.
- L: in position 3 (correct).
- T: allowed.
- I: allowed, and in position 5 (not 2, so okay).

This seems to be the only viable word left.We now know:
- L is fixed in position 3 (✓).
- I is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, O, T, V, W, L.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- L in position 3 (_ _ L _ _).
- I somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Only unused letters.

A valid word meeting these constraints is **VOLTI**.

1. L is in position 3 (✓).
2. I is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 5.  Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.
3. O is in the word but **not** in position 2.  So O can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  (Position 3 is already L, so 1, 4, or 5.)
4. Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y, V, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, O, W, L.

Pattern: _ _ L _ _ with I in position 1 or 4, and O somewhere (1, 4, or 5).

Possible words:
- I O or I _ must appear.
- Valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ L _ _ with I in 1 or 4 and only the allowed letters.

Let's list:

- I _ _ L _ – impossible, since L must be 3rd.
- _ I L _ _ – I in 2nd is disallowed.
- _ _ L I _ – I in 4th: possible.
- _ _ L _ I – I in 5th is disallowed.

Thus I must be in position 4: pattern _ _ L I _.

Remaining positions 1, 2, 5 must be from B, D, F, G, K, O, W.

Possible candidates:

- B O L I D  (B, O, L, I, D) – valid word “BOLID”.
- F O L I D  (“FOLID”) – not common.
- D O L I B  (“DOLIB”) – not a word.
- G O L I D  (“GOLID”) – not a word.
- W O L I D  (“WOLID”) – not a word.
- B O L I K  (“BOLIK”) – not a word.
- F O L I K  (“FOLIK”) – not a word.
- K O L I B  – “KOLIB” not a word.
- K O L I D  – “KOLID” not a word.
- G O L I K  – “GOLIK” not a word.

The only real English word that fits is **BOLID**.

Updated constraints after the five guesses:

- L is correctly fixed in position 3: _ _ L _ _
- I is in the word but must NOT be in positions 2, 5 (from earlier feedback) or 4 (now ruled out by BOLID).  
  ⇒ I must be in position **1**.
- O is in the word but must NOT be in positions 2, 4, 5.  
  ⇒ O must be in position **1** — but position 1 is already taken by I if we place I there.  
  This forces us to realize that both I and O must appear somewhere else, yet all remaining positions for each are now exhausted. That can only mean **O is not the single additional vowel**; the word must contain **both I and O**.

Therefore the pattern is:
I _ L O _  or  O _ L I _  
(positions 1 & 4 swapped).

But I cannot be in position 4 and O cannot be in position 2, 4, 5, so the only viable arrangement is:

I _ L O _

Positions 2 and 5 must be from the still-allowed letters:  
F, G, K, W  (B, D, C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y, V, T already eliminated).

Possible words fitting I _ L O _ :

- I F L O _ → need 5th letter. Allowed letters left: G, K, W.  
  “IFLOW” – not a valid English word.
- I G L O _ → “IGLOO” – but O is already in position 4; third O would require duplicate O without evidence. Also “IGLOO” has O in 3rd, invalid because L must be 3rd.
- I K L O _ → “IKLO_” – nothing valid.
- I W L O _ → “IWLOW” – not a word.

Realizing the only sensible English word left is **IGLOO**, even though it forces us to accept two O’s. Testing the letters:

I (position 1) – allowed  
G (position 2) – allowed  
L (position 3) – required ✓  
O (position 4) – allowed  
O (position 5) – allowed

No other common 5-letter word fits all constraints.

  This forces us to realize that both I and O must appear somewhere else, yet all remaining positions for each are now exhausted. That can only mean **O is not the single additional vowel**; the word must contain **both I and O**.

Therefore the pattern is:
I _ L O _  or  O _ L I _  
(positions 1 & 4 swapped).

But I cannot be in position 4 and O cannot be in position 2, 4, 5, so the only viable arrangement is:

I _ L O _

Positions 2 and 5 must be from the still-allowed letters:  
F, G, K, W  (B, D, C, R, A, N, E, S, U, M, P, H, Y, V, T already eliminated).

Possible words fitting I _ L O _ :

- I F L O _ → need 5th letter. Allowed letters left: G, K, W.  
  “IFLOW” – not a valid English word.
- I G L O _ → “IGLOO” – but O is already in position 4; third O would require duplicate O without evidence. Also “IGLOO” has O in 3rd, invalid because L must be 3rd.
- I K L O _ → “IKLO_” – nothing valid.
- I W L O _ → “IWLOW” – not a word.

Realizing the only sensible English word left is **IGLOO**, even though it forces us to accept two O’s. Testing the letters:

I (position 1) – allowed  
G (position 2) – allowed  
L (position 3) – required ✓  
O (position 4) – allowed  
O (position 5) – allowed

No other common 5-letter word fits all constraints.",Guess 6: IGLOO -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) G(✓) L(✓) O(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
