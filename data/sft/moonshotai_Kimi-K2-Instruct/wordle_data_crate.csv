- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help reveal the presence or absence of many letters. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers multiple vowels and consonants. This gives us a broad starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) –E(✓) and N(x) we know:
- Letters in the word (in some order): C, R, A, E (but not necessarily at these positions).
- Position clues:
  - C is in position 1 (✓).
  - R is in position 2 (✓).
  - A is in position 3 (✓).
  - N is not in the word (x).
  - E is in position 5 (✓).

Thus the word must be of the form: C R A _ E.

The only missing letter is the 4th one. The remaining letters must be consonants (since A and E are already placed). Valid 5-letter words that fit CRA_E include CRATE, CRAVE, CRAZE, CRANE (but N is excluded), and CRASE (not a word). The most common and valid word among these is CRATE.

Let's try CRATE.
