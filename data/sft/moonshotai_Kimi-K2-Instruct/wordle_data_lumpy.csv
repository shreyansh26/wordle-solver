For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us maximum information. This means picking a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (covers common letters S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ARISE is particularly good because it contains the five most common letters in 5-letter words: A, R, E, S, I. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word.

All five letters in ARISE were marked “x”, which means none of A, R, I, S, E appear in the secret word at all.

Our next guess should therefore avoid every one of those five letters.  
We still want a word with common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet, so we can quickly narrow the possibilities.  
Looking at remaining high-frequency letters:

- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, F, G, H, K, Y, W…  
- Vowels (not yet eliminated): O, U

Some strong candidates built from these untouched letters:
- TOUCH (T, O, U, C, H)  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D)  
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T)

TOUCH uses five completely new, fairly common letters (T, O, U, C, H) that haven’t appeared before. It’s a good balance of consonants and vowels and will give us a lot of information.

So, let’s go with TOUCH.

Current constraints gathered from all feedback:

Known letters  
- U is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, 1, 2 (it appeared in every spot we tried it).  
  Therefore U must sit in position 5.

Forbidden letters (x marks):  
A, R, I, S, E, T, O, C, H, B

Known letters in wrong positions (- marks):  
- P is in the word but not in position 1  
- L is in the word but not in position 2  
- M is in the word but not in position 4  

So the word pattern is:  
[?][?][?][?]U  
with P, L, M present somewhere in the first four spots.

Available letters (still allowed): D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus P, L, M, U.

We need three more distinct letters (there are 5-letter slots and we already have P, L, M, U).

Let’s pick a valid word that fits:

- Places U in position 5.  
- Uses P, L, M once each.  
- Adds one additional allowed letter.  
- Uses each of P, L, M in a position that has not yet been marked wrong for that letter.

Candidate: “PLUMY” – but “Y” is allowed, however P, L, M placements are positions 1,2,3 which were already marked (-) for P and L, so that fails.

Candidate: “FLUMP” – but does not have U last and repeats P.

Candidate: “GLUMY” – but L is in position 2 which is disallowed from PLUMB feedback.

Candidate: “LUMPY” – U is in position 2 which is disallowed.

Candidate: “JUMPY” – has B (forbidden).  

Candidate: “DUMPY” – has P in position 4 which is disallowed.

Candidate: “GLYMP” – not a valid word.

Candidate: “GLUMP” – U not in position 4, but we need U in position 5. Invalid.

Re-examine: we have four known letters P, L, M, U, and need exactly one more distinct letter. The word must contain one additional consonant to reach five distinct letters.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that ends in U, contains P, L, M once each, and has one more consonant.

Only one such word exists: “PLUMY” – but as seen earlier, P and L are in wrong positions. 

Wait, let’s search a dictionary with constraints:
- Ends with U  
- Letters from {D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus P, L, M  
- Must include P, L, M, and one extra letter

We must have made an error. Let’s re-list the constraints carefully.

Recap:  
- Word is 5 letters.  
- U must be in position 5.  
- Letters forbidden: A, R, I, S, E, T, O, C, H, B.  
- Must include P, L, M each once.  

So word pattern:  
_ _ _ _ U  
with {P, L, M} appearing once each in the first four positions, plus one extra distinct letter from allowed set D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must find a valid English word matching that pattern.

List all 5-letter English words ending in U that contain P, L, M once each.

Scrabble dictionary search gives exactly one such word: “PLUMY” – but as previously, U is in position 4 in PLUMY, which is disallowed.

We have exhausted combinations and found no valid English word ending in U that contains exactly the letters P, L, M, U plus one other consonant. This implies we misunderstood the constraints.

Re-reading feedback carefully:

Guess 3: PLUMB -> Feedback: P(-) L(-) U(-) M(-) B(x)

Meaning:

P is in word, but not in position 1  
L is in word, but not in position 2  
U is in word, but not in position 3  
M is in word, but not in position 4  
B is not in word.

Nowhere does it say P, L, M must appear exactly once each; they can appear multiple times, and we just know they are somewhere in the word. This opens many more possibilities.

Revised constraints:

- Word length 5  
- Letters forbidden: A, R, I, S, E, T, O, C, H, B  
- U must appear at least once, and not in position 3  
- P must appear at least once, and not in position 1  
- L must appear at least once, and not in position 2  
- M must appear at least once, and not in position 4  

We are free to use any other letters from remaining set: D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We now need a valid 5-letter English word satisfying these constraints.

Let’s search:

- Must contain U (not in position 3)  
- Must contain P (not in position 1)  
- Must contain L (not in position 2)  
- Must contain M (not in position 4)  

Example words:

“PULMU” – invalid (not English).  
“PLUMU” – invalid.  
“LUMPU” – U in position 4, allowed (position 3 is forbidden for U only).  

“LUMPU” is invalid English.

“UMPUL” – invalid.

“MULPU” – invalid.

“FLUMP” – U in position 3 – disallowed.

“PLUMY” – U in position 4, allowed.

Let’s check each position constraint:

PLUMY:  
P in position 1 – disallowed (must not be in position 1).  

“LUMPY” – U in position 2, allowed.  
Check P in position 5 – allowed (constraint is P not in position 1).  
L in position 1 – allowed (constraint is L not in position 2).  
M in position 3 – allowed (constraint is M not in position 4).  
Meets all constraints.  

“LUMPY” is valid English.

Therefore, next guess is LUMPY.
