For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Includes both vowels and consonants to test different letter types

Some good starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A, E, O (very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- No repeating letters

This should give me good information about which vowels and common consonants are in the target word.

Current locked letters:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 5: E ✓

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, H, L, M

Letters still unknown for positions 2 and 4.

From SHINE we learned N is in the word (but not in position 4).  
From SLIME we learned M is not in the word, confirming N must be in position 4 (the only remaining spot).

So the pattern is now:
S _ I N E

We only need to fill position 2 with any letter that has **not** been ruled out (A, R, O, H, L, M) and still keeps the result valid. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

“SPINE” is a valid word, uses P in position 2, and has not been tested yet.  
Let’s try it.
