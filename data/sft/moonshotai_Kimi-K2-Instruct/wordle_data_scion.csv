For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can quickly help me identify common letters and their positions. The best approach is to use a word with frequently used letters in English. Common starting words include:

- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in different positions to maximize information gain from the feedback.

We now know:
- First letter is S (fixed)
- The word does NOT contain: L, A, T, E, P, U, K
- N is present, but NOT in the 4th position (it is somewhere else in the word)

So we have: S _ _ _ _ with N appearing once, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the still-allowed set {B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, O, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
Since N must appear exactly once, and it can’t be in slot 4, we have four possible slots for N: 2, 3, 4 (already ruled out), or 5.

Let’s try to cover several new consonants and a new vowel.  
Good consonants left to test: R, M, C, H, D, G.  
Good vowels left to test: I, O.

I’ll build a word that:
- Keeps S in slot 1
- Places N in slot 2 (a common pattern)
- Adds three still-allowed consonants and a vowel.

A candidate that fits: SNORT  
- S (slot 1) ✓  
- N (slot 2) ✓  
- O (new vowel) ✓  
- R and T are new letters, but T was already eliminated in SLATE, so T is out. Thus SNORT is invalid.

  - S ✓  
  - W, O, R, D – none are in the banned set {L,A,T,E,P,U,K}.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: S is fixed (✓).
- Excluded letters: L, A, T, E, P, U, K, plus now O, N, I, C (each appeared and got “-”, so they are present but in wrong positions).
- Allowed remaining letters (common ones remaining): B, D, F, G, H, M, R, W, Y plus vowels we haven’t touched (none so far).
- We still need the letter N somewhere (from SPUNK feedback: N(-)), but it cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (each of those spots gave N “-”). The only place N can go is position 2, but that got “-”. That means N is definitely present and must be in one of positions 3, 4, 5, but those all gave “-”.

Wait - this seems contradictory. SONIC gave N(-) in position 3, SPUNK gave N(-) in position 4. The only remaining slot for N is position 5.

So the pattern is S _ _ _ N.

We also have to avoid all excluded letters and reuse none of O, I, C in their same spots, but we haven’t placed any of them yet. The simplest next test is to pick unused common consonants and a vowel.

Good consonants left: R, D, M, H, B, G, F, Y, W.  
We need four more letters, one must be a vowel (but O, I, A, U, E are all blocked). The only remaining common vowel is Y (sometimes acts as vowel).

A plausible word: S ? ? ? N. Let’s try S H R Y N (but that’s not common).  
Another: S W I N G - but I, N, G are allowed? No, I was in SONIC at position 4 and got “-”, N must be at position 5. So S W _ _ N.

Best common word: S W O R N - but O was “-” in position 2 in SONIC, so can’t use O in position 2.  
Try S W I N D - but D is allowed, I was “-” in position 4, N must be position 5, so S W I N D: that’s 5 letters, but I can’t be in position 4. Actually position 4 is D, I is position 3.

Wait, let's list constraints clearly:
- Position 1: S
- Position 5: N
- Cannot use: L, A, T, E, P, U, K, O, I, C
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, R, W, Y + any others not listed.

We need three more letters for positions 2, 3, 4 from allowed set, forming a valid word.  
Common word fitting: S H R U N - U excluded.  
S H R N ? – need extra letter.  
S H R E N – E excluded.  
S H R I N – I excluded.  
S H R Y N – not common.  
S W I N G – I excluded, N not at 5.  
S W O R N – O excluded.  
S P R I N – P, I excluded.  
S B R I N – B, I, N positions ok? Wait N must be at 5.

Actually, let’s think of real words starting with S and ending with N, avoiding all excluded letters.

Real words:
- SWORN – O excluded.  
- SWAIN – A, I excluded.  
- SPAWN – A, W excluded.  
- STERN – E, T excluded.  
- SCRUM – not ending with N.  
- SHRUN – U excluded.  
- SPRYN – not a word.  

The only remaining common word seems S H R U N (invalid) or S H R Y N (not standard).  
Another possibility: S B R I N – but I excluded.  
S D R I N – not a word.  
S F R I N – not a word.  
S W R I N – not a word.  
S M R I N – not a word.  
S G R I N – G, R, I, N: I excluded.  

Realizing that we’re stuck on common vowels, let’s try S W R Y N – but Y is between W and R. Actually, S W R Y N isn’t valid.  

Another look: S W I N G – but N must be at 5, so S W I N G would have N at 4. Not matching.  

The constraints are severe. Only remaining common word seems S W O R N, but O is excluded.  

Upon closer examination, the only 5-letter word starting with S, ending with N, avoiding all excluded letters, is S H R U N – but U is excluded.  

Therefore, the only viable remaining candidate is S W R Y N, but that’s not a dictionary word.  

Rechecking: the excluded letters are L, A, T, E, P, U, K, O, I, C. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, R, S, W, Y, N.  

We need S _ _ _ N. The middle three letters must be from B, D, F, G, H, M, R, W, Y, forming a valid word.  

One real word: S T R I N – T, I excluded.  
S H R I N – I excluded.  
S C R I N – C, I excluded.  
S P R I N – P, I excluded.  
S W R I N – not a word.  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine feedback:

From SONIC: S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(-) C(-). This means:
- O is in word, but not position 2.  
- N is in word, but not position 3.  
- I is in word, but not position 4.  
- C is in word, but not position 5.  

Thus the word must contain S, O, N, I, C – but that is 5 distinct letters. Therefore the word is S, then some permutation of O, N, I, C in positions 2-5.

Possible permutations: SONIC gave positions, so:
- O not position 2
- N not position 3
- I not position 4
- C not position 5

Thus valid arrangements of O,N,I,C:
Positions 2-5: permutations of O,N,I,C avoiding:
- O not slot 2
- N not slot 3
- I not slot 4
- C not slot 5

Valid permutations:
1. O,N,I,C – invalid (O at 2)
2. O,N,C,I – invalid (O at 2)
3. O,I,N,C – invalid (O at 2)
4. O,I,C,N – invalid (O at 2)
5. O,C,N,I – invalid (O at 2)
6. O,C,I,N – invalid (O at 2)
7. N,O,I,C – invalid (N at 3)
8. N,O,C,I – valid (N at 2, O at 3, C at 4, I at 5) -> S N O C I
9. N,I,O,C – invalid (N at 2, I at 3, O at 4, C at 5: C at 5 invalid)
10. N,I,C,O – invalid (C at 4, but no restriction on C at 4, but I at 3 is ok, N at 2 ok, O at 5 ok) -> S N I C O
11. N,C,O,I – invalid (C at 3, O at 4, I at 5 ok) -> S N C O I
12. N,C,I,O – invalid (I at 4 ok, O at 5 ok) -> S N C I O
13. I,O,N,C – invalid (I at 2, N at 4, C at 5 invalid)
14. I,O,C,N – invalid (I at 2, C at 4, N at 5 ok) -> S I O C N
15. I,N,O,C – invalid (I at 2, N at 3 invalid)
16. I,N,C,O – invalid (N at 3 invalid)
17. I,C,O,N – invalid (I at 2, C at 3, O at 4, N at 5) -> S I C O N
18. I,C,N,O – invalid (N at 4 ok, O at 5 ok) -> S I C N O
19. C,O,N,I – invalid (C at 2, O at 3, N at 4, I at 5 ok) -> S C O N I
20. C,O,I,N – invalid (C at 2, O at 3, I at 4 invalid)
21. C,N,O,I – invalid (C at 2, N at 3, O at 4, I at 5 ok) -> S C N O I
22. C,N,I,O – invalid (N at 3 invalid)
23. C,I,O,N – invalid (C at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5) -> S C I O N
24. C,I,N,O – invalid (N at 4 ok, O at 5 ok) -> S C I N O

Valid candidate words:
- S N O C I – but not a real word.
- S N I C O – not a word.
- S N C O I – not a word.
- S N C I O – not a word.
- S I O C N – not a word.
- S I C O N – this is a real word (SCION)
- S C O N I – not a word.
- S C N O I – not a word.
- S C I O N – not a word.
- S C I N O – not a word.

Only real word is SCION.

Check constraints:
- Starts with S ✓
- Contains O, N, I, C exactly once each ✓
- O not at position 2 (it's at 3) ✓
- N not at position 3 (it's at 4) ✓
- I not at position 4 (it's at 2) ✓
- C not at position 5 (it's at 1, already S) ✓ – actually C is at position 3 here, so ok.

Thus, the next and likely correct guess is SCION.
