For a first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains vowels to identify which vowels are in the word
3. Has common consonants to test multiple possibilities
4. Doesn't repeat letters to test more unique letters

A very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- Uses 5 unique letters to maximize information gain
- These are all high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1  
R(x) – R is not in the word  
O(x) – O is not in the word  
S(x) – S is not in the word  
E(x) – E is not in the word  

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A, but not at position 1  
- does **not** contain R, O, S, or E at all  

We still need a vowel to have a valid word, and knowing A is present (but not in spot 1) is crucial.  
Good remaining vowels are I and U.  
Among common consonants that haven’t been ruled out, T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc. are still possible.

A strong second guess would:
1. use A (but not in position 1)  
2. avoid R, O, S, E  
3. include several of the remaining high-frequency consonants to maximize info  

The word “UNTIL” satisfies:
- U and I (additional vowels)  
- N, T, L (remaining common consonants)  
- A not used here, but we can test other vowels and consonants quickly  

However, we already know A is present somewhere, so a guess that places A in positions 2-5 while introducing other new letters would be better.

Another option: “PAINT”:
- Places A in position 2  
- Introduces P, I, N, T (none ruled out)  
- Keeps the word common and valid  

Let me go with that.

   - A is in position 2 exactly.  
   - I is not in the word.  
   - N is in position 4 exactly.  
   - T is in position 5 exactly.

Current constraints on the secret word:
- It has fixed letters: _ A _ N T (positions 2,4,5 known).  
- It may **not** contain R, O, S, E, P, I.  
- The remaining unused letters are among: B C D F G H J K L M Q U V W X Y Z.  
- The missing letters (positions 1 and 3) must EACH:
  – be from the allowed set above
  – combine to form a valid 5-letter English word
  – not repeat any already-used letters (A, N, T)

Good consonant pairs for positions 1 and 3 that keep the word common:

D A M N T → “damnt” – invalid  
L A M N T → “lamnt” – invalid  
B A L N T → “balnt” – invalid  

That leaves one very common word:  
C A N N T – no, repeats N.  
D A N G T – no.  

Pause: the only common word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T and uses allowed letters is:

C A N T (but needs 5 letters).  
So: C A _ N T.  

We have to have a 5-letter word: C A _ N T.

C A K N T – not a word.  
C A Z N T – not a word.  
C A W N T – not a word.  

Wait—let’s list the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3:

Allowed pool (excluding A, N, T, and forbidden letters):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try every valid dictionary word:

M A C N T – “macnt” – no.  
M A H N T – “mahnt” – no.  
V A N N T – repeats N – no.  

Wait, let’s check: actual English 5-letter words that match “_ A _ N T” and avoid forbidden letters.

Searching my mental lexicon:

- DAUNT – D A U N T – U is allowed, fits: _ A _ N T.  
  Letters: D (pos1), A (pos2), U (pos3), N (pos4), T (pos5).  
  None of the forbidden letters (R,O,S,E,P,I) appear.  
  Check if any of its letters are already ruled out:  
  – D, A, U, N, T: all are allowed.  
  – A, N, T are in their correct positions per feedback.  
  – U has not been tested, so it is still possible.

Therefore “DAUNT” is a perfectly valid next guess that fits every constraint.

I’ll lock that in.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains vowels to identify which vowels are in the word
3. Has common consonants to test multiple possibilities
4. Doesn't repeat letters to test more unique letters

A very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently
- Uses 5 unique letters to maximize information gain
- These are all high-frequency letters in English 5-letter words

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1  
R(x) – R is not in the word  
O(x) – O is not in the word  
S(x) – S is not in the word  
E(x) – E is not in the word  

So the secret word:
- contains the letter A, but not at position 1  
- does **not** contain R, O, S, or E at all  

We still need a vowel to have a valid word, and knowing A is present (but not in spot 1) is crucial.  
Good remaining vowels are I and U.  
Among common consonants that haven’t been ruled out, T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc. are still possible.

A strong second guess would:
1. use A (but not in position 1)  
2. avoid R, O, S, E  
3. include several of the remaining high-frequency consonants to maximize info  

The word “UNTIL” satisfies:
- U and I (additional vowels)  
- N, T, L (remaining common consonants)  
- A not used here, but we can test other vowels and consonants quickly  

However, we already know A is present somewhere, so a guess that places A in positions 2-5 while introducing other new letters would be better.

Another option: “PAINT”:
- Places A in position 2  
- Introduces P, I, N, T (none ruled out)  
- Keeps the word common and valid  

Let me go with that.

<guess>paint</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: paint -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. paint → P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)  
   - P is not in the word.  
   - A is in position 2 exactly.  
   - I is not in the word.  
   - N is in position 4 exactly.  
   - T is in position 5 exactly.

Current constraints on the secret word:
- It has fixed letters: _ A _ N T (positions 2,4,5 known).  
- It may **not** contain R, O, S, E, P, I.  
- The remaining unused letters are among: B C D F G H J K L M Q U V W X Y Z.  
- The missing letters (positions 1 and 3) must EACH:
  – be from the allowed set above
  – combine to form a valid 5-letter English word
  – not repeat any already-used letters (A, N, T)

Good consonant pairs for positions 1 and 3 that keep the word common:
C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, B, etc.

Try every plausible combination:
C A M N T → “camnt” – invalid  
C A B N T → “cabnt” – invalid  
B A N N T – repeats N, invalid  
C A L N T → “calnt” – invalid  
G A M N T → “gamnt” – invalid  
H A L N T → “halnt” – invalid  
D A M N T → “damnt” – invalid  
L A M N T → “lamnt” – invalid  
B A L N T → “balnt” – invalid  

That leaves one very common word:  
C A N N T – no, repeats N.  
D A N G T – no.  

Pause: the only common word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T and uses allowed letters is:

C A N T (but needs 5 letters).  
So: C A _ N T.  

We have to have a 5-letter word: C A _ N T.  
Possible: C A M N T – not a word.  
C A L N T – not a word.  
C A R N T – R is forbidden.  
C A G N T – not a word.  
C A B N T – not a word.  
C A H N T – not a word.  
C A D N T – not a word.  
C A V N T – not a word.  
C A K N T – not a word.  
C A Z N T – not a word.  
C A W N T – not a word.  

Wait—let’s list the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3:

Allowed pool (excluding A, N, T, and forbidden letters):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try every valid dictionary word:

B A C N T – “bacnt” – not a word.  
B A D N T – “badnt” – no.  
B A G N T – “bagnt” – no.  
C A B N T – “cabnt” – no.  
C A D N T – “cadnt” – no.  
C A G N T – “cagnt” – no.  
G A M N T – “gamnt” – no.  
H A M N T – “hamnt” – no.  
H A L N T – “halnt” – no.  
M A C N T – “macnt” – no.  
M A H N T – “mahnt” – no.  
V A N N T – repeats N – no.  

Wait, let’s check: actual English 5-letter words that match “_ A _ N T” and avoid forbidden letters.

Searching my mental lexicon:

- DAUNT – D A U N T – U is allowed, fits: _ A _ N T.  
  Letters: D (pos1), A (pos2), U (pos3), N (pos4), T (pos5).  
  None of the forbidden letters (R,O,S,E,P,I) appear.  
  Check if any of its letters are already ruled out:  
  – D, A, U, N, T: all are allowed.  
  – A, N, T are in their correct positions per feedback.  
  – U has not been tested, so it is still possible.

Therefore “DAUNT” is a perfectly valid next guess that fits every constraint.

I’ll lock that in.
