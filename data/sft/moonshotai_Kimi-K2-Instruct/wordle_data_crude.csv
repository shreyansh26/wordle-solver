- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and gives good coverage to narrow down the possibilities. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique common letters.

Looking at these letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to get maximum information from the first guess.

Let’s reconcile the feedback so far.

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is correct in position 5.  
   - R is present but not in position 1.  
   - A, I, S are absent.

2. TOWER → T(x) O(x) W(x) E(-) R(-)  
   - T, O, W absent.  
   - E is present but not in position 4.  
   - R is present but not in position 5.

3. VERVE → V(x) E(-) R(-) V(x) E(✓)  
   - V absent (appears twice, both marked x).  
   - E is present but not in position 2.  
   - R is present but not in position 3.  
   - The final E is confirmed again in position 5.

Consolidated constraints:
- Word ends with E.  
- Contains R.  
- Contains at least one more E (explaining the “-” feedbacks), but that extra E can only be in positions 1 or 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are ruled out).  
- Forbidden letters: A, I, S, T, O, W, V.  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (from above feedback).  
  – From RAISE, not position 1.  
  – From TOWER, not position 5.  
  – From VERVE, not position 3.  
  Therefore R must be in position 2 or 4.

But the extra E must be in position 1 or 3.  
If extra E is in position 1, then R must be in 2 or 4, giving patterns:
- E R _ _ E  
- E _ _ R E  

If extra E is in position 3, then R must be in 2 or 4, giving patterns:
- _ R E _ E  
- _ _ E R E  

Let’s list candidate words fitting these patterns, avoiding forbidden letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,crude,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and gives good coverage to narrow down the possibilities. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique common letters.

Looking at these letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to get maximum information from the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E is in the correct position (5th).
- R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains R (but not first). We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the 5th letter.
- Has R somewhere in positions 2-4.
- Does not contain A, I, or S.

Good candidates: 
- TROVE (R in 2nd), 
- DROVE (R in 2nd), 
- TOWER (R in 4th), 
- ROVER (but R is first – disallowed), 
- CREPE (R in 2nd), 
- GROPE (R in 3rd).

""TOWER"" fits the criteria:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in the 4th position.
- No A, I, or S.

   This can only mean one thing: the word has TWO E’s, one of which is in position 5 (from RAISE), and another E that is NOT in position 4 (from TOWER).

2. Letter R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from RAISE it was -, and in TOWER it’s - again).

3. Letters A, I, S, T, O, W are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (from RAISE feedback).
- Contains at least one more E somewhere else (positions 1-4).
- Contains R in positions 2 or 3 or 4 (and not overlapping with extra E).
- No A, I, S, T, O, W.

Possible patterns:  
- E _ R _ E  
- _ E R _ E  
- _ _ E R E  
- E R _ _ E  
- etc., avoiding forbidden letters.

Looking at the remaining alphabet (excluding A, I, S, T, O, W) and requiring two E’s and one R:

- E R V E E → invalid (R is 2nd, extra E at 4th but 3rd letter V ok, but only 5 letters)
- F E R V E → but ends with E, has R in 3rd, second E in 2nd. Letters F, E, R, V are all allowed.

""FERVE"" is not a valid word, but ""VERVE"" is:

V E R V E
- Ends with E (ok).
- Has R in 3rd (ok).
- Has E in 2nd (ok).
- Two E’s satisfy the double-E requirement.
- No A, I, S, T, O, W.

Let’s distill everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties  
   - C is in position 1 (✓).  
   - R is in position 2 (✓).  
   - E is in position 5 (✓ from RAISE and confirmed again here).

2. Remaining positions (3 and 4)  
   - Position 3 cannot be E (from CREPE feedback).  
   - P is not in the word at all (x).  
   - All forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, T, O, W, V, P.

3. Alphabet still available for positions 3 & 4  
   Letters not yet ruled out:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, X, Y, Z  
   (We need consonants because the only vowel we may still use is the already-placed Es.)

4. Pattern to solve  
   C R _ _ E, with the blanks filled by two distinct allowed consonants.

Generate all real English 5-letter words that fit “CR??E”:

CRANE – has A (forbidden)  
CREPE – already tried  
CRIME – has I (forbidden)  
CRORE – has O (forbidden)  
CRUDE – has U and D  
CRUSE – has S (forbidden)  
CRONE – has O (forbidden)  
CRUZE – variant of CRUZ; Z and U allowed, but uncommon  
CRAVE – has A (forbidden)  
CREME – has M and E, but position 3 already can’t be E  
CRONE – O forbidden  
CRINE – I forbidden  
CRULE – non-word  
CRUTE – non-word  
CRUVE – V forbidden  

The only common word left that uses allowed letters is “CRUDE” (C R U D E).  
Letters: C, R, U, D, E  
- U and D are both allowed.  
- No forbidden letters present.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CRUDE.
