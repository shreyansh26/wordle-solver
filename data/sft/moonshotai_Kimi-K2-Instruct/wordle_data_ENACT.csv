For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps rule in or out many possibilities quickly.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""ADIEU"" (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is strong because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps narrow down vowel usage.
2. It has very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words.
3. These letters combine in ways that test multiple positions effectively.

There's no prior feedback yet, so this is purely about information gathering.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x): I is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently last letter, so must move).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, I, or S.

Next, we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both A and E (since both are confirmed present).
2. Excludes R, I, S (confirmed absent).
3. Places A somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good common letters left to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
A solid next guess could be ""TEACH"" – it has A and E in new positions, plus common consonants T and C, and H isn’t ruled out. But E is last in TEACH, which is position 5 (still invalid for E). So swap E forward: ""CHEAT"" keeps A in position 3 and E in position 2. This meets all constraints.

Alternatives like ""BEACH"" or ""LEAPT"" could work, but ""CHEAT"" is a strong common word testing new consonants.

- H(x): H is NOT in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd, so it’s 1,2,4,5)
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th, so it’s 1,2,3,5)
- T(✓): T is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Ends in T (position 5).
- Contains A, C, E in some positions other than 2, 3, 4 respectively for each of them.
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, H (from earlier) and positions for A, C, E are still unknown.
  
We have letters: A, C, E, T (fixed at 5). Need one more letter. Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to place A, C, E while leaving the 5th as T. Possible structure: _ _ _ _ T.

- A cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- C cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.

One possible arrangement: place C in position 2, A in position 3, E in position 1, giving E C A _ T. The blank needs a letter not yet ruled out. Let’s use N (common and not previously tested).

Thus: ECANT – but that’s 5 letters. Wait, ECANT is valid.
But let me check another: place A in 1st, E in 2nd, C in 4th: A E _ C T. The blank could be N: A E N C T – but ENACT (reorder) would work. Actually, let’s try PLACE, but P and L weren’t in previous guesses.

But based on constraints, a better word is LANCE:
- L is new, not ruled out.
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was in 2 and 4 before, now it’s 2 which is different from CHEAT’s 4 and RAISE’s 2 – wait, in RAISE A was in position 2, so A cannot be in position 2. So LANCE has A in 2, which matches RAISE’s position – that’s invalid. 

Thus, A must be in 1, 3, or 5, but 5 is T, so A in 1 or 3. Let’s try A in 1:
A _ _ _ T. E needs to be in 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are out). C needs to be in 2-5, not 1 or 3 (from CHEAT). 

If we put E in 2 and C in 4: A E _ C T. The blank could be N: A E N C T. But this is ENACT (reordered). ENACT is valid:
- A: position 3 (valid, not in 2 or 4)
- C: position 4 (valid, not 1)
- E: position 2 (valid, not 3 or 5)
- T: position 5 (correct)
- N: new letter, not ruled out.

ENACT fits all constraints.
