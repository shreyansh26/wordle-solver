For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains all five most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E), giving me a strong foundation to work with regardless of which letters are correct.

From the feedback:
- E(✓) – the last letter is E and in the correct position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word ends in E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.  
I also know the remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining 21 letters, excluding those four plus the already-used E.  
Good consonants left that are common: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.  
I’ll look for 5-letter words ending in E that avoid A, R, O, S.  
One such word is “UNTIE”, which has U, N, T, I, E. None of the excluded letters appear.  
Let me choose “UNTIE” as the second guess to test new vowels and common consonants.

From the two guesses we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I are **NOT** in the word at all.

That leaves the consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels: E (already in the correct place), and sometimes Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with E
- uses only the remaining letters
- has a common consonant pattern to maximize information.

Possible consonant combinations could use letters like L, M, D, B, C, H, K, etc.  
After scanning the remaining letters, the word “FLAME” comes to mind, but it has A and M, and we know A is out.  
Another candidate: “BLEED” – but has E twice and we only know one E is confirmed, and D is okay, but we don’t know if double E is allowed or helpful.

A better choice is “WHELP” – but it doesn’t end with E.

Looking again, we need _ _ _ _ E.  
Let’s try “CHIME” – but I is out.  
“DELVE” – but V is okay, D, E, L are okay. But we don’t know if V is in the word.

“FLECK” – but ends with K and we need E at the end.

Let’s try “WEDGE” – but G is okay, D is okay, E is correct at the end.  
Letters: W, E, D, G – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
This seems valid.

Wait, let’s double-check:  
- Ends with E: ✔  
- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I: ✔  
- Uses common letters: W, D, G.

1. The word ends in E (from FEEDBACK: E(✓) in the 5th position).
2. All of these letters are **NOT** in the word at all:
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G
3. From Guess 3, the letter E appears **at least twice** (second E is marked “-” = right letter, wrong spot), so we need **two E’s in the word**, one at the end, one somewhere in positions 1-4.

Letters still allowed (alphabet minus the banned set):
B C F H J K L M P Q V X Y Z plus the vowel Y and the two E’s we already know must appear.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has one more E inside it, and only uses allowed letters.

Candidate scan:
- BLEED – contains D (banned)
- CREPE – contains R, P (R banned)
- FLEECE – too long
- KEEPE – not a standard word
- JEEZE – contains Z (allowed) but slang
- CLEPE – archaic
- FLEME – contains M and F; check if F, L, M, E are all allowed:
  – F, L, M are allowed (not in banned list)
  – E is allowed
  – Word FLEME ends in E, has a second E; length 5.

But “fleme” is archaic. Next safe word: “HEME” – too short.

Another approach: start with common double-E patterns near the end.
- “BEE” + something + E → 5 letters total: B E E _ E → but we already have E in 5th spot, so BEEFE? Not valid.

But multiple E’s could confuse; let’s pick one with exactly two E’s, one at the end, one elsewhere.

Good starting words often include letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains all five most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E), giving me a strong foundation to work with regardless of which letters are correct.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E(✓) – the last letter is E and in the correct position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word ends in E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.  
I also know the remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining 21 letters, excluding those four plus the already-used E.  
Good consonants left that are common: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.  
I’ll look for 5-letter words ending in E that avoid A, R, O, S.  
One such word is “UNTIE”, which has U, N, T, I, E. None of the excluded letters appear.  
Let me choose “UNTIE” as the second guess to test new vowels and common consonants.

That leaves the consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels: E (already in the correct place), and sometimes Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with E
- uses only the remaining letters
- has a common consonant pattern to maximize information.

Possible consonant combinations could use letters like L, M, D, B, C, H, K, etc.  
After scanning the remaining letters, the word “FLAME” comes to mind, but it has A and M, and we know A is out.  
Another candidate: “BLEED” – but has E twice and we only know one E is confirmed, and D is okay, but we don’t know if double E is allowed or helpful.

A better choice is “WHELP” – but it doesn’t end with E.

Looking again, we need _ _ _ _ E.  
Let’s try “CHIME” – but I is out.  
“DELVE” – but V is okay, D, E, L are okay. But we don’t know if V is in the word.

“FLECK” – but ends with K and we need E at the end.

Let’s try “WEDGE” – but G is okay, D is okay, E is correct at the end.

This seems valid.

Wait, let’s double-check:  
- Ends with E: ✔

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains all five most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E), giving me a strong foundation to work with regardless of which letters are correct.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E(✓) – the last letter is E and in the correct position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word ends in E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.  
I also know the remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining 21 letters, excluding those four plus the already-used E.  
Good consonants left that are common: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.  
I’ll look for 5-letter words ending in E that avoid A, R, O, S.  
One such word is “UNTIE”, which has U, N, T, I, E. None of the excluded letters appear.  
Let me choose “UNTIE” as the second guess to test new vowels and common consonants.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I are **NOT** in the word at all.

That leaves the consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowels: E (already in the correct place), and sometimes Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with E
- uses only the remaining letters
- has a common consonant pattern to maximize information.

Possible consonant combinations could use letters like L, M, D, B, C, H, K, etc.  
After scanning the remaining letters, the word “FLAME” comes to mind, but it has A and M, and we know A is out.  
Another candidate: “BLEED” – but has E twice and we only know one E is confirmed, and D is okay, but we don’t know if double E is allowed or helpful.

A better choice is “WHELP” – but it doesn’t end with E.

Looking again, we need _ _ _ _ E.  
Let’s try “CHIME” – but I is out.  
“DELVE” – but V is okay, D, E, L are okay. But we don’t know if V is in the word.

“FLECK” – but ends with K and we need E at the end.

Let’s try “WEDGE” – but G is okay, D is okay, E is correct at the end.  
Letters: W, E, D, G – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
This seems valid.

Wait, let’s double-check:  
- Ends with E: ✔  
- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I: ✔  
- Uses common letters: W, D, G.  

“WEDGE” looks good.

<guess>WEDGE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: WEDGE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract what we now know for certain:

1. The word ends in E (from FEEDBACK: E(✓) in the 5th position).
2. All of these letters are **NOT** in the word at all:
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G
3. From Guess 3, the letter E appears **at least twice** (second E is marked “-” = right letter, wrong spot), so we need **two E’s in the word**, one at the end, one somewhere in positions 1-4.

Letters still allowed (alphabet minus the banned set):
B C F H J K L M P Q V X Y Z plus the vowel Y and the two E’s we already know must appear.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has one more E inside it, and only uses allowed letters.

Candidate scan:
- BLEED – contains D (banned)
- CREPE – contains R, P (R banned)
- FLEECE – too long
- KEEPE – not a standard word
- JEEZE – contains Z (allowed) but slang
- CLEPE – archaic
- FLEME – contains M and F; check if F, L, M, E are all allowed:
  – F, L, M are allowed (not in banned list)
  – E is allowed
  – Word FLEME ends in E, has a second E; length 5.

But “fleme” is archaic. Next safe word: “HEME” – too short.

Another approach: start with common double-E patterns near the end.
- “BEE” + something + E → 5 letters total: B E E _ E → but we already have E in 5th spot, so BEEFE? Not valid.

Better choice: “PEEVE”
- Ends E (spot 5) ✔
- Second E at spot 2 is in wrong spot (needs to be somewhere else).  
- Letters: P, E, E, V, E → uses only P, V, E (all allowed).  
- Standard word.

But multiple E’s could confuse; let’s pick one with exactly two E’s, one at the end, one elsewhere.

Valid option: “FLEME” is not standard.  
“FREED” contains R and D (banned).  
“MELEE” – but M, E, L are allowed; ends E, has two E’s.  
Check letters: M, E, L – none banned.  
“MELEE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s lock in “MELEE”.

<guess>MELEE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: WEDGE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: MELEE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) L(-) E(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

1. Position 5 must be E (✓ every time).
2. The letters **not** anywhere in the word:
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G, M, L.

3. We **still need one more E** somewhere inside the word (because every previous feedback shows at least one additional E marked “-”, and MELEE even had two of them).  
   Therefore the word contains **exactly two E’s**: one at the end, one somewhere in positions 1–4.

4. Remaining letters we are allowed to use:  
   B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z plus the vowel Y (and the two required E’s).

5. We need a 5-letter pattern
   _ _ _ _ E  
   with exactly one more E inside the first four positions, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
E _ _ _ E  
_ E _ _ E  
_ _ E _ E  
_ _ _ E E  (but we already know position 5 is E; a double E at the end would put the second E in position 4, so this is effectively “_ _ _ E E” which ends in EE and still keeps position 5 as E).

Let’s list candidates that match and are valid English words:

- EXEEM – invalid / not a word  
- EXEVE – invalid  
- EPEPE – invalid  
- EPEE E – not a word  
- BEECH – contains C & H (allowed) but we need two E’s and it ends in H not E.  
- CEEPE – invalid  
- FEEBE – invalid  
- JEEZE – slang, but 5 letters, ends E, has two E’s, letters J, E, Z, all allowed.  
- PEEKE – invalid  
- PEEVE – 5 letters, ends E, letters P, E, V — all allowed.  
- PEEPE – invalid  
- QUEEN – contains N (banned).  
- VEEPE – invalid  
- YEVEE – invalid  
- ZEEKE – invalid  

Best valid word that meets every constraint: **PEEVE**.

Letters: P, E, E, V, E

- Contains exactly two E’s in the word (one inside) ✓  
- No banned letters ✓
