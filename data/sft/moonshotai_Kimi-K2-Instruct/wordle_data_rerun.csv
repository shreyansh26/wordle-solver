For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English to quickly identify which letters are in the word. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English words. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Summary of what we’ve learned so far:

Letters already ruled out: A, D, O, S, T  
Letters present in the secret word, with their known positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓ in Guess 2)  
- R is somewhere other than position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1)  
- E also appears elsewhere in the word, but definitely not in position 4 or 5 (since the second E in DETER received -, but the first E was ✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ _ with an additional E and an R somewhere in the remaining four positions (positions 1, 3, 4, 5).  
The additional E and R must fit within the remaining spots, and we cannot use any of the forbidden letters A, D, O, S, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2  
- Contains exactly one more E and one R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let me list valid letters: B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A possible word that satisfies these constraints is ""MERGE"":
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓)  
- R is in position 4 (allowed)  
- Second E is in position 5 (but from Guess 2, E cannot be in position 5 because the E in that position was marked with -). So MERGE is invalid because the fifth letter would be E, which we already know is not allowed in position 5.

Next candidate: ""FERRY""  
- E is in position 2 (✓ matches)  
- R appears twice: position 3 and 4. This is fine as long as it doesn’t violate position constraints.  
- However, the second R is in position 5, which is allowed for R (R was only forbidden from position 2 in Guess 1).  
But we have an extra E in position 3, but we already have E in position 2 and need only one more E. FERRY has only one E, so it’s valid. Wait, no: F E R R Y has E in position 2 and R in positions 3 and 4. This fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and uses R and no forbidden letters.

But we need an additional E somewhere (since the word must contain two Es total, given the feedback). FERRY has only one E, so it’s invalid.

Next candidate: ""HERVE""  
This has E in position 2, R in position 4, and another E in position 5. But E is not allowed in position 5 (from Guess 2), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""VERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- Another E in position 5 (invalid, as before)

Next candidate: ""NERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Next candidate: ""PERVE""  
- Same issue with E in position 5.

Next candidate: ""BERET""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, R)

This seems valid. BERET has:
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3  
- E in position 4 (allowed, since the only E restriction is that it cannot be in position 5)

No other letters violate previous constraints.

So the next logical guess is BERET.

- Same issue with E in position 5.

Next candidate: ""BERET""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, R)  
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid. BERET has:
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3  
- E in position 4 (allowed, since the only E restriction is that it cannot be in position 5)

No other letters violate previous constraints.

So the next logical guess is BERET.

Current hard facts:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, B, D, O, S, T  
2. E must be in position 2 (from the ✓ in both DETER and BERET)  
3. R must be in position 3 (from the ✓ in BERET)  
4. The word contains an extra E somewhere (since the last E in BERET received “–” but we already have E at position 2).  
   That extra E cannot be in position 1 (because E is currently at 2) or position 4 (because the E in position 4 of BERET got “–”).  
   Therefore the extra E must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ E R _ E

Remaining letters (allowed so far): C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need two different letters for positions 1 and 4.

A common 5-letter word matching _ E R _ E is “PERKE”, but K is allowed. Let me check:
P E R K E -> uses P and K, none of which are banned.

Another candidate is “FERVE” but V is allowed, but F E R V E is valid as far as constraints go. However “PERKE” or “MERGE” are good. Let me pick “PERKE” since P and K are frequent in English.

But I need to ensure the word is valid English. “PERKE” is not a common English word, so let’s think of valid ones: “PERSE” is invalid because S is banned, “MERGE” is invalid because G and M are allowed, but E is already at 2 and 5, so MERGE is M E R G E -> pattern _ E R _ E with G in 4. Let me use MERGE.

Wait, MERGE has E in positions 2 and 5, and G in 4, M in 1. That fits the pattern _ E R _ E. Also, M, E, R, G are all allowed.

Hence, MERGE seems like the best next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells me:

- A is NOT in the secret word.  
- R is in the word but is in the wrong position.  
- O is NOT in the secret word.  
- S is NOT in the secret word.  
- E is in the word but is in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- contains R and E  
- does NOT contain A, O, S  

And from “wrong position” we know:
- R cannot be in position 2 (where it was in AROSE)  
- E cannot be in position 5 (where it was in AROSE)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- has R somewhere other than position 2  
- has E somewhere other than position 5  
- avoids A, O, S entirely

A good next candidate is “DETER”:
- It has E in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is position 5.  
- It has R in position 3, which is allowed.  
- It avoids A, O, S.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we’ve learned so far:

Letters already ruled out: A, D, O, S, T  
Letters present in the secret word, with their known positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓ in Guess 2)  
- R is somewhere other than position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1)  
- E also appears elsewhere in the word, but definitely not in position 4 or 5 (since the second E in DETER received -, but the first E was ✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ _ with an additional E and an R somewhere in the remaining four positions (positions 1, 3, 4, 5).  
The additional E and R must fit within the remaining spots, and we cannot use any of the forbidden letters A, D, O, S, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2  
- Contains exactly one more E and one R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let me list valid letters: B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A possible word that satisfies these constraints is ""MERGE"":
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓)  
- R is in position 4 (allowed)  
- Second E is in position 5 (but from Guess 2, E cannot be in position 5 because the E in that position was marked with -). So MERGE is invalid because the fifth letter would be E, which we already know is not allowed in position 5.

Next candidate: ""FERRY""  
- E is in position 2 (✓ matches)  
- R appears twice: position 3 and 4. This is fine as long as it doesn’t violate position constraints.  
- However, the second R is in position 5, which is allowed for R (R was only forbidden from position 2 in Guess 1).  
But we have an extra E in position 3, but we already have E in position 2 and need only one more E. FERRY has only one E, so it’s valid. Wait, no: F E R R Y has E in position 2 and R in positions 3 and 4. This fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and uses R and no forbidden letters.

But we need an additional E somewhere (since the word must contain two Es total, given the feedback). FERRY has only one E, so it’s invalid.

Next candidate: ""HERVE""  
This has E in position 2, R in position 4, and another E in position 5. But E is not allowed in position 5 (from Guess 2), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""VERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- Another E in position 5 (invalid, as before)

Next candidate: ""NERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Next candidate: ""PERVE""  
- Same issue with E in position 5.

Next candidate: ""BERET""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, R)  
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid. BERET has:
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3  
- E in position 4 (allowed, since the only E restriction is that it cannot be in position 5)

No other letters violate previous constraints.

So the next logical guess is BERET.

From all feedback we now know:

1. Exact positions:
   - E at position 2 (✓ every time)  
   - R at position 3 (✓ in BERET and MERGE)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   A, B, D, G, M, O, S, T

3. Extra letter information:
   - We still need at least one more E (because every E after position 2 has received “–”, so it must appear somewhere else).  
   - The only positions left for that extra E are 1, 4, or 5 (since E cannot be at 2 again).  
   - From Guess 4 (MERGE) the E at position 5 got “–”, so E is **not** at position 5.  
     Therefore the extra E must be either at position 1 or 4.

Hence the current skeleton is either

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,rerun,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English to quickly identify which letters are in the word. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English words. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells me:

- A is NOT in the secret word.  
- R is in the word but is in the wrong position.  
- O is NOT in the secret word.  
- S is NOT in the secret word.  
- E is in the word but is in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- contains R and E  
- does NOT contain A, O, S  

And from “wrong position” we know:
- R cannot be in position 2 (where it was in AROSE)  
- E cannot be in position 5 (where it was in AROSE)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- has R somewhere other than position 2  
- has E somewhere other than position 5  
- avoids A, O, S entirely

A good next candidate is “DETER”:
- It has E in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is position 5.  
- It has R in position 3, which is allowed.  
- It avoids A, O, S.

<guess>DETER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DETER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) T(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we’ve learned so far:

Letters already ruled out: A, D, O, S, T  
Letters present in the secret word, with their known positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓ in Guess 2)  
- R is somewhere other than position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1)  
- E also appears elsewhere in the word, but definitely not in position 4 or 5 (since the second E in DETER received -, but the first E was ✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ E _ _ _ with an additional E and an R somewhere in the remaining four positions (positions 1, 3, 4, 5).  
The additional E and R must fit within the remaining spots, and we cannot use any of the forbidden letters A, D, O, S, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2  
- Contains exactly one more E and one R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let me list valid letters: B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A possible word that satisfies these constraints is ""MERGE"":
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓)  
- R is in position 4 (allowed)  
- Second E is in position 5 (but from Guess 2, E cannot be in position 5 because the E in that position was marked with -). So MERGE is invalid because the fifth letter would be E, which we already know is not allowed in position 5.

Next candidate: ""FERRY""  
- E is in position 2 (✓ matches)  
- R appears twice: position 3 and 4. This is fine as long as it doesn’t violate position constraints.  
- However, the second R is in position 5, which is allowed for R (R was only forbidden from position 2 in Guess 1).  
But we have an extra E in position 3, but we already have E in position 2 and need only one more E. FERRY has only one E, so it’s valid. Wait, no: F E R R Y has E in position 2 and R in positions 3 and 4. This fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and uses R and no forbidden letters.

But we need an additional E somewhere (since the word must contain two Es total, given the feedback). FERRY has only one E, so it’s invalid.

Next candidate: ""HERVE""  
This has E in position 2, R in position 4, and another E in position 5. But E is not allowed in position 5 (from Guess 2), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""VERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- Another E in position 5 (invalid, as before)

Next candidate: ""NERVE""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- E in position 5 (invalid)

Next candidate: ""PERVE""  
- Same issue with E in position 5.

Next candidate: ""BERET""  
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, R)  
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid. BERET has:
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- R in position 3  
- E in position 4 (allowed, since the only E restriction is that it cannot be in position 5)

No other letters violate previous constraints.

So the next logical guess is BERET.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DETER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) T(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 3: BERET -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) R(✓) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current hard facts:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, B, D, O, S, T  
2. E must be in position 2 (from the ✓ in both DETER and BERET)  
3. R must be in position 3 (from the ✓ in BERET)  
4. The word contains an extra E somewhere (since the last E in BERET received “–” but we already have E at position 2).  
   That extra E cannot be in position 1 (because E is currently at 2) or position 4 (because the E in position 4 of BERET got “–”).  
   Therefore the extra E must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ E R _ E

Remaining letters (allowed so far): C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need two different letters for positions 1 and 4.

A common 5-letter word matching _ E R _ E is “PERKE”, but K is allowed. Let me check:
P E R K E -> uses P and K, none of which are banned.

Another candidate is “FERVE” but V is allowed, but F E R V E is valid as far as constraints go. However “PERKE” or “MERGE” are good. Let me pick “PERKE” since P and K are frequent in English.

But I need to ensure the word is valid English. “PERKE” is not a common English word, so let’s think of valid ones: “PERSE” is invalid because S is banned, “MERGE” is invalid because G and M are allowed, but E is already at 2 and 5, so MERGE is M E R G E -> pattern _ E R _ E with G in 4. Let me use MERGE.

Wait, MERGE has E in positions 2 and 5, and G in 4, M in 1. That fits the pattern _ E R _ E. Also, M, E, R, G are all allowed.

Hence, MERGE seems like the best next guess.

From the feedback so far we have locked-in facts:

- Letter positions:
  – E is fixed at position 2 (every ✓ at that spot).
  – R is fixed at position 3 (every ✓ at that spot).

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
  A, B, D, G, M, O, S, T, V

- Extra requirement:
  – The word must contain at least one more E, but every time we placed an E after position 2 it received “–”.
    - E cannot be in position 1 (from VERVE it was V(x), not E, yet E still must appear elsewhere).
    - E cannot be in position 4 (from MERGE it got “–”).
    - E cannot be in position 5 (from DETER, BERET, MERGE, VERVE it got “–” every time).

The only remaining spot for the second E is position 1, giving:

E E R _ _

Allowed letters for the last two positions (positions 4-5) are any from
{C, F, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z}
and must form a valid English word.

The only common 5-letter word fitting E E R _ _ is “EERIE”, but it repeats I and E in ways that collide with our constraints (I is allowed, however).

Check:
E E R I E
- E at 1,2 ✓
- R at 3 ✓
- I allowed
- E at 5: but we already know E cannot be at 5 (every attempt gave “–”). Therefore EERIE is invalid.

Next possible: “EERED” and “EEROS” are invalid (D and S banned).

The only English word left that truly fits E E R _ _ without using banned letters and without placing another E at 5 is **“EERCE” but that is not a valid word.**

Wait – there is one valid word: “EERIE” is the only dictionary entry, but it has E at 5 which we’ve ruled out.

This implies the extra E must actually be hidden in the form of a double-E spelling within the first two letters only, and the remaining two letters must then provide the fifth character without an extra E. The word must therefore be exactly:

E E R _ _ with the last two letters NOT including E.

Searching again we find **“EERNL”** (invalid), **“EERCH”** (invalid), etc.

Realizing the mistake: the word must have exactly two Es (one at position 2 and one more) and must fit E E R _ _. The only recognized word is **“EERIE”**, but it violates the E-at-5 ban.

Conclusion: the only remaining possibility is the pattern **E E R _ _** with non-E letters at 4-5. The sole valid English word satisfying this is **“EERIE”** but that would contradict the feedback on position 5.

Therefore, the earlier assumption must be re-checked. In fact the word **must** contain exactly two Es (one at 2, one at 1) and three consonants, forming **E E R _ _**. The correct word with remaining allowed letters is **“EERIE”** itself, but it repeats E at 5 which is impossible.

Re-evaluate: the word must be **E E R I E**, but feedback says E at 5 is invalid. Hence, the word must be **E E R I (only 4 letters)** – impossible.

This contradiction shows the only possible word is **EERIE** even though it feels risky, because every other combination fails. There is literally **no other** 5-letter English word matching the locked positions and constraints.

Conclusion: the hidden word is **EERIE**.
