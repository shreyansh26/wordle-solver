For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good starting word uses several of these without repeating letters. Some excellent options are: STARE, AROSE, IRATE, or CRANE. I'll go with CRANE because it covers C, R, A, N, E - giving us good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

Since every letter in CRANE was marked ""x"" (not in the word), I now know that the word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E.  
That rules out a lot of English words, so I need a new set of common letters that avoid those five.  
The most common remaining letters are roughly: T, O, I, S, L, U, P, M, D, B, G, H, K, Y.

Let’s update our constraints from all feedback so far:

1. S is locked in position 1 (✓).
2. O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because SOLID gave O(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore O must be in position 3, 4 or 5.
3. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, I, D.
4. Letters still allowed (and common): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, W, etc.

We know:
- S _ _ _ _ (S is fixed in position 1)
- O appears exactly once somewhere after position 2 (3, 4, or 5)
- No repeats among the remaining letters allowed.

We need a valid five-letter word that satisfies these constraints and preferably introduces new letters to maximize information gain.

Candidate patterns:
S _ O _ _   or   S _ _ O _   or   S _ _ _ O

Let’s look for real words fitting these patterns using the allowed letters.

Examples:
- SMOKE: S M O K E -> E is banned – invalid
- SPOKE: S P O K E -> E banned – invalid
- SHOCK: C is banned – invalid
- SLOSH: T is banned – invalid
- SHOGY: Not a valid word

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good starting word uses several of these without repeating letters. Some excellent options are: STARE, AROSE, IRATE, or CRANE. I'll go with CRANE because it covers C, R, A, N, E - giving us good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since every letter in CRANE was marked ""x"" (not in the word), I now know that the word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E.  
That rules out a lot of English words, so I need a new set of common letters that avoid those five.  
The most common remaining letters are roughly: T, O, I, S, L, U, P, M, D, B, G, H, K, Y.

To maximize information gain again, I should pick a word that uses five fresh, common letters.  
A good candidate is ""STOUT"" – it uses S, T, O, U, none of which appeared in CRANE, and they’re all fairly common letters.

Therefore, my next guess is STOUT.

- C, R, A, N, E, T, U are NOT in the word at all (x).

Letters we now know are usable: S, O, plus the remaining unused common letters that have not been ruled out: D, L, I, P, Y, F, G, H, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains O somewhere other than the third position.
- Avoids C, R, A, N, E, T, U.

Possible structures:
S _ _ _ _ with O in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- SOLID: S, O (pos 2), L, I, D – none of the banned letters.
- SPOIL: S, P, O (pos 3) – but O can’t be in pos 3, so this is invalid.
- SLOPY: S, L, O (pos 3) – again invalid.

Let’s list everything we now know.

Letters ruled out entirely: C, R, A, N, E, T, U, I, D, M, G, Y  
(That’s 12 letters gone.)

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S in position 1
- O somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5 (because every previous O was marked “-” or “✓”)

So the pattern must be:
S _ _ _ _   with an O in one of positions 2-5 and
the remaining three letters chosen from the still-allowed pool:  
B, F, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English 5-letter word that:
1. starts with S
2. contains exactly one O
3. uses only the allowed letters above
4. has no repeats.

Scanning my mental word list, the most common letters left are B, F, L, P, W.
A quick check yields:

- SPOOF  -> F is allowed, O is allowed, but we have no information about double letters and F is common.
- SPOOL  -> L is allowed, but double O may be risky and L was earlier marked “-” in position 3 of SOLID; it could still appear elsewhere.
- SPOKE  -> K and E: E is banned.
- SWOOP  -> double O again.
- SLOBS  -> double S, unlikely.
- SHOWY  -> H and W and Y: but Y is already banned.
- SPOOR  -> R is banned.
- SLOSH  -> T is banned.
- SPOOK  -> K is allowed and we haven’t tried K yet.

S P O O K has double O, but we still don’t know whether the word contains doubles and we’re running low on new common letters. Let’s avoid doubles for now.

Another candidate: SLOPE  -> E is banned.
SPOOF is risky because of the double O and F is only moderately common.
The real word that jumps out is SPOOK – single P, single K, single O (position 3), and we have never tested K yet.

So I’ll go with SPOOK.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S in position 1
- O somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5 (because every previous O was marked “-” or “✓”)

So the pattern must be:
S _ _ _ _   with an O in one of positions 2-5 and
the remaining three letters chosen from the still-allowed pool:  
B, F, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English 5-letter word that:
1. starts with S
2. contains exactly one O
3. uses only the allowed letters above
4. has no repeats.

Scanning my mental word list, the most common letters left are B, F, L, P, W.
A quick check yields:

- SPOOF  -> F is allowed, O is allowed, but we have no information about double letters and F is common.
- SPOOL  -> L is allowed, but double O may be risky and L was earlier marked “-” in position 3 of SOLID; it could still appear elsewhere.
- SPOKE  -> K and E: E is banned.
- SWOOP  -> double O again.
- SLOBS  -> double S, unlikely.
- SHOWY  -> H and W and Y: but Y is already banned.
- SPOOR  -> R is banned.
- SLOSH  -> T is banned.
- SPOOK  -> K is allowed and we haven’t tried K yet.

S P O O K has double O, but we still don’t know whether the word contains doubles and we’re running low on new common letters. Let’s avoid doubles for now.

Another candidate: SLOPE  -> E is banned.
SPOOF is risky because of the double O and F is only moderately common.
The real word that jumps out is SPOOK – single P, single K, single O (position 3), and we have never tested K yet.

So I’ll go with SPOOK.

Let’s condense what we now know.

Letters absolutely ruled out (so far):  
C, R, A, N, E, T, U, I, D, M, G, Y, P, K   (14 letters)

Letters still allowed:  
B, F, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z   (and the already-confirmed S and O)

Position constraints:  
- S is fixed in position 1.  
- O must appear exactly once, and it cannot be in position 3 (from SOLID) or position 5 (from SPOOK), so the only remaining slots for O are 2 or 4.  
- The other three positions must be filled from the tiny pool above (B, F, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z) with no repeats.

Therefore possible patterns are:
S O _ _ _   (O in 2)  
S _ _ O _   (O in 4)

Let’s list candidate real words:

For S O _ _ _  
Allowed letters for the blanks: B, F, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Real words fitting: SOBHZ, SOFJZ, etc. – none of these are valid English words.  
The only remotely common one is SOBHZ (not a word).  

For S _ _ O _  
We need three letters from {B, F, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z} placed in positions 3 and 5 around the O in 4.

Possible combinations:  
S _ _ O _  
Valid English words:
- SHLOP  (no, P is banned)  
- SLOWO (not valid)  
- SHLOO (invalid)  
- SLOTH (T is banned)  
- SLOWS (valid) – letters S, L, O, W, S – double S is acceptable because we know S is already fixed in slot 1; the second S would be in slot 5 and we have no evidence against it.

Check SLOWS:  
S in 1 – confirmed correct.  
L – still allowed.  
O in 4 – allowed by the new constraint.  
W – still allowed.  
S in 5 – allowed because we don’t yet know about slot 5.

SLOWS is a real English word and fits every constraint.

Therefore, the only reasonable remaining guess is SLOWS.
