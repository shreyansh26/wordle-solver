### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z to increase chances of getting hits
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. Contains 5 unique letters to test as many letters as possible

Good starting words often include:
- AROSE (high frequency letters)
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Must include A somewhere (but not 3rd position, since it was marked wrong position)
- Must NOT include C or N
- R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5 respectively

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R _ _ E and contains A in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded by feedback).

Possible candidates:
- BRAVE (but V was not tested yet)
- FRAME (but M was not tested yet)
- GRADE (D not tested)
- CRATE (but C is excluded)
- DRAG E (not valid)
- PRASE (not valid word)
- TRADE (D not tested, A in 3rd position, but A can't be in 3rd)

Looking at valid options:
- FRAME: F,R,A,M,E → checks _ R A _ E → A would be in 3rd position, but A is marked as wrong position in 3rd (from CRANE feedback). So FRAME is invalid.
- BRACE: C is excluded
- BRAVE: B,R,A,V,E → _ R A _ E → A is in 3rd position which is invalid
- GRADE: G,R,A,D,E → _ R A _ E → again A in 3rd position invalid
- TRACE: C is excluded
- PRATE: C is excluded

Alternative approach: maybe A is in 4th position. Let's think of _ R _ A E words:
- BRAKE: But K not tested, and it's _ R A K E → A in 3rd invalid
- CRANE already tried
- GRATE: C excluded
- DRANK: N excluded
- FRANK: N excluded
- BREAD: D not tested, but _ R E A D → but E is fixed at 5th
- BREAK: But needs E at 5th

Actually, the pattern is _ R _ _ E with A somewhere not in 3rd. So possible:
- BRAKE: _ R A K E → A in 3rd invalid
- BRACE: C excluded
- GRADE: _ R A D E → A in 3rd invalid
- TRADE: _ R A D E → A in 3rd invalid
- FRAMED is 6 letters
- PRASE is invalid
- CRASE is invalid

Wait, maybe I need to consider A in 1st position:
- A R _ _ E
- ARDEE: not a word
- ARDOR: not matching
- ARENE: not common
- ARGUE: _ R G U E → but A is missing
- ARROW: but O not tested

This seems tricky. Maybe ""GRAPE"" - G,R,A,P,E:
- _ R A P E → A in 3rd invalid
""BREAD"" is _ R E A D but E is fixed at 5th
""FRAME"" is _ R A M E → A in 3rd invalid
""BRACE"" has C
""GRAVE"" is _ R A V E → A in 3rd invalid

Alternative: maybe A is in 4th position making _ R _ A E:
- B R A C E: C excluded
- D R A K E: valid word
- F R A M E: A in 3rd invalid
- G R A P E: A in 3rd invalid
- P R A I S E: too long
- T R A D E: _ R A D E → A in 3rd invalid

Looking at valid _ R _ A E words:
- DRAKE: D,R,A,K,E → _ R A K E → but A is in 3rd position which is invalid
No, wait - DRAKE is D,R,A,K,E → positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=K, 5=E → A in 3rd invalid

Actually, the only valid positions for A are 1st or 4th with pattern _ R _ _ E:
- A R _ _ E: ARDEE, ARERE, ARGUE, ARISE, etc.
- _ R _ A E: B R A C E (C excluded), D R A K E (A in 3rd), etc.

""ARISE"" seems valid: A,R,I,S,E → fits A in 1st position, R in 2nd (correct), E in 5th (correct), and includes A which must be in the word.

But does ARISE fit the constraints?
- A R I S E → A is in 1st position (was in 3rd in CRANE, so new position)
- R is in 2nd (correct from feedback)
- E is in 5th (correct from feedback)
- Doesn't use C or N
- Includes A which must be in the word

This seems like the best next guess.

Based on the feedback:
- R is in position 2 (✓)

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. Positions that are locked:
   - 2nd letter = R
   - 5th letter = E

2. Letters that must appear in the word (but not yet locked to positions):
   - A (must be present, and from first feedback it is NOT in position 3)
   - S (must be present, and from second feedback it is NOT in position 4)

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
   - C, N, I

4. Pattern so far: A R _ S E or _ R A S E or _ R S A E, etc.
   – but A cannot be in position 3.

Looking at the word skeleton: _ R _ _ E

We still need to place A and S in positions 1, 3, or 4, with the constraints:
- A ≠ position 3
- S ≠ position 4

Possible placements:
- A in 1st, S in 3rd → A R S _ E
- A in 1st, S in 4th → invalid (S would be in 4th, which is excluded)
- A in 3rd → invalid
- A in 4th → _ R _ A E, then S must go in 1st or 3rd; 3rd would put S in 3rd, 1st would put S in 1st.

Let’s list 5-letter words matching _ R _ _ E, containing A and S, avoiding C, N, I:

Try A R S _ E → ARS_E:
- ARSON: ends with N (excluded)
- ARSED / ARSES: not recognized common words
- ARSE?: too few hits

Try _ R A S E → seems impossible because we need 5 letters and A is 3rd (excluded)

Try S R A _ E → but R must be 2nd.

Try _ R S A E → need a letter in 1st spot: GRS? RARE? No.

Try _ R A _ E with S in 3rd:
- B R A S E → BRASE (variant spelling of brass, but rare)
- G R A S E → not common
- P R A S E → prase (valid mineral term)
- T R A S E → trase (valid archaic term)

But we want a common word.

Another possibility: S _ R _ E won’t fit R in 2nd.

Alternative: _ R S _ E with A in 4th → _ R S A E
- G R A S E → but A is 3rd, invalid
Wait: _ R _ S E and A must be in 1st or 4th:

- A R _ S E → AR?SE
  A R O S E → arose (but O not yet tested)
  A R A S E → invalid (A twice)
  A R U S E → aruse (rare)

- _ R A S E → 1st letter needed: B R A S E → but A is 3rd, invalid
- _ R S A E → 1st letter: G R S A E → grase (rare)
- _ R _ S E with A in 1st → A R _ S E → AROSE (A in 1st, R in 2nd, S in 4th, E in 5th, and O new)

AROSE:
- A in 1st (allowed)
- R in 2nd (locked)
- O new letter
- S in 4th (allowed since S was only banned from 4th in ARISE, but ARISE had S in 4th and got ✓, so actually S can be in 4th; looking back:
  In ARISE feedback, S was ✓ in position 4, which means S is in the word but NOT necessarily in position 4?  Wait, no: ARISE got S(✓) which means S is in the word AND in position 4.  So S is locked to 4th.

Ah, I misread the feedback.  In ARISE:
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 1 (correct spot)
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (correct)
- I(x) → I not in word
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in position 4 (correct)
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (correct)

Therefore, the word is:

A R _ S E with the third letter unknown.

We have to pick a 5-letter word fitting AR_ _ E with letters not excluded (no C, N, I) and no duplicate letters unless already present (A, R, S, E present once each).

Possible third letters (avoid C, N, I, and letters already used A,R,S,E):

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Check dictionary for AR?SE:

- ARBSE – not a word
- ARDSE – no
- ARFSE – no
- ARGSE – no
- ARHSE – no
- ARKSE – no
- ARLSE – no
- ARMSE – no
- ARNSE – N excluded
- AROSE – O not excluded, valid word
- ARPSE – no
- ARTSE – no
- ARUSE – no
- ARVSE – no
- ARWSE – no
- ARYSE – no
- ARZSE – no

Only common word is AROSE.  But ARISE gave ✓ for S in position 4, so 4th letter is S.

So word must be A R _ S E.

Wait, no: ARISE gave S in 4th as ✓ (correct position), so 4th is S.

Thus the unknown is 3rd letter: A R ? S E.

Valid words:
- A R B S E – not found
- A R D S E – ardse? no
- A R F S E – no
- A R G S E – no
- A R H S E – no
- A R K S E – no
- A R L S E – no
- A R M S E – no
- A R O S E – arose (valid)
- A R P S E – no
- A R T S E – no
- A R V S E – no
- A R W S E – no
- A R Y S E – no
- A R Z S E – no

Thus AROSE is the only candidate fitting AR?SE, but AROSE is A R O S E, which matches all constraints and uses O which hasn’t been excluded.
