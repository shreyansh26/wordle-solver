- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to choose a first guess that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses common vowels and consonants, ideally without repeating letters. This helps cover a wide range of possible letters in the English alphabet. Some common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). This should give us a good indication of which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- A, O, S, and E are not in the word at all (x).

So now I know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed in position 2).
2. The letters A, O, S, E are eliminated.
3. I need to test new consonants and vowels not yet tried.

Good letters to test next: T, I, N, L, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.
I want a word that keeps R in position 2 and uses new letters not eliminated.

Possible structure: [new consonant/vowel] R [new consonant/vowel] [new consonant/vowel] [new consonant/vowel]

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"": 
- T, I, U, M are all new letters not tested before.
- Keeps R in position 2.
But ""TRIUM"" isn't a valid English word.

Next candidate: ""BRICK"" - but B wasn't tested and we have no info on it, plus C/K might be redundant.

Better: ""DRINK"" - uses D, I, N, K. All new letters, R in position 2. This seems like a good test.

Another good option: ""FRUIT"" - F, U, I, T. Again all new letters.

Between DRINK and FRUIT, DRINK tests more common consonants (D, N, K), so I'll go with that.

So far:

- The word has the pattern: D R I _ _ (D, R, I all ✓ in positions 1,2,3 respectively).
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, N, K.

Remaining letters to test in positions 4 and 5 should exclude those six.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, W, Y  
Common remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E, I are already used or placed).

A very common 5-letter ending after “DRI” is “VE” → “DRIVE” (V and E).  
But E was already shown to be absent in Guess 1, so E is out.

Another common pattern is “DRILL” (L, L), but double letters give limited new info.

Next best: “DRIFT” – F and T are both new untested letters, and the word is common.

Double-check letters used so far vs. “DRIFT”:
- D, R, I already confirmed.
- F, T are new and not yet eliminated.

Looks good.
