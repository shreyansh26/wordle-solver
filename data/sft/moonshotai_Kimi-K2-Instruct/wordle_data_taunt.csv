For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that is a valid 5-letter English word and contains common letters that are likely to appear in many words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Some good starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" - uses very common letters S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E
- ""RAISE"" - similar to above with S and E
- ""ADIEU"" - uses many vowels but fewer consonants

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has a good mix of common consonants and vowels, covering 5 of the most frequent letters in English.

Feedback so far:
- Letters we know are in the word: A (fixed in position 2), T (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, E, R, I, O.

Pattern of the secret word:
- 1st letter: unknown, must be from remaining common consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.)
- 2nd letter: A
- 3rd letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters (cannot be T, because T is not in position 4, so we can test it here)
- 4th letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters (cannot be T)
- 5th letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters

We also know T must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback: T(-)), but it is not in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 (from RATIO). So possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is A, so T must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s test T in position 1:
- Word format: T A _ _ _

Remaining common consonants to test: C, M, N, K, etc. Let’s try ""TAC"" as a prefix and add two more consonants that haven’t been used yet. ""TAC"" is not a complete word, so let’s think of valid 5-letter words starting with TA and containing T somewhere.

But simpler: since T must be in position 1 or 5, and we haven’t seen it in position 1 yet, let’s try T in position 1.

Candidate word: TACHY – but not common.
Better common words: TANKS, TAMER, TAWNY, TABBY, etc. But we have constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- T must be in position 1 or 5 (from feedback).

Let’s try T in position 1: T A _ _ _

Now fill positions 3-5 with new common consonants not yet used. From unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants left: C, N, K, etc.

Let’s pick ""TAN"" as root and extend: T A N K _. Need a 5th letter. ""TANKS"" is valid, but S is already ruled out. ""TANKY"" – not a word. ""TANGO"" – O is ruled out. 

Next: T A M _ _. ""TAMER"" – E is ruled out. ""TAMMY"" – M and Y are okay, but double M might be less likely. 

Alternative: T A C _ _. ""TACET"" – E is ruled out. ""TACKY"" – Y is okay, K is new. ""TACKY"" is a valid word and uses new letters K and Y.

Another approach: T in position 5. Then word is _ A _ _ T. 

Let’s try ""C A _ _ T"". ""CABOT"" – B is okay. ""CANT"" is 4 letters. ""CAVET"" – not a word. 

""MAT"" as root: M A _ _ T. ""MATCH"" – C and H are new. ""MATCH"" fits: M, A, T, C, H. T is in position 4 here, but feedback says T is not in position 4 (from SLATE). So ""MATCH"" has T in 4, which is invalid. 

""N A _ _ T"": ""NASTY"" – S is ruled out. ""NATty"" – not 5 letters. 

""M A _ T _"": ""MAT"" plus two more. ""MATTE"" – E is ruled out. 

Best option seems ""TACKY"" with T in position 1.

But let’s verify letters used so far:
- Ruled out: S, L, E, R, I, O
- Known in word: A (pos 2), T (somewhere not 3 or 4)
- ""TACKY"": T, A, C, K, Y – all new letters except A and T. T is in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (fixed). 

Thus, ""TACKY"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""TANGO"" – but O is ruled out. 
""TAUNT"" – U is ruled out (from RATIO feedback: O(x) implies O not in word, but U wasn’t tested; actually U is separate). Wait, RATIO feedback only ruled out O, not U. So ""TAUNT"" is possible: T A U N T. But T is in position 5 here, which is allowed. However, double T might be less likely. 

Between ""TACKY"" and ""TAUNT"":
- ""TACKY"": T, A, C, K, Y – new letters C, K, Y
- ""TAUNT"": T, A, U, N, T – new letters U, N, but double T

""TACKY"" introduces more new consonants (C, K, Y) without duplication, so I’ll go with it.

But wait, let’s re-examine T position:
From SLATE: T not in 4.
From RATIO: T not in 3.
Thus T must be in 1, 2, or 5.
But position 2 is A, so T must be in 1 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. T A _ _ _
2. _ A _ _ T

For pattern 1: T A _ _ _. Best candidate so far is TACKY.
For pattern 2: _ A _ _ T. Let’s see: 
- 1st letter: new consonant, e.g. C, M, N
- 3rd letter: new consonant
- 4th letter: new consonant
Example: C A B B T – invalid. C A N T O – O ruled out. C A R T S – R and S ruled out. 

""B A N K T"" – not a word. ""C A N T Y"" – not a word. 

Seems pattern 1 gives more valid options. Thus ""TACKY"" is best.

But let me think of another word:
""TA"" + new consonants + ""T"": e.g. T A P E T – not valid. 

Actually, ""TAWNY"" – W and N, Y. T in 1, A in 2, W N Y new. Valid word. 

Between TACKY and TAWNY:
- TACKY: C, K, Y
- TAWNY: W, N, Y

Both are good. ""TAWNY"" introduces W and N, which are also common. I’ll go with ""TAWNY"".

Final check:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (fixed)
- W, N, Y – all new letters
- No ruled-out letters used

""N A _ _ T"": ""NASTY"" – S is ruled out. ""NATty"" – not 5 letters. 

""M A _ T _"": ""MAT"" plus two more. ""MATTE"" – E is ruled out.

- ""TACKY"": T, A, C, K, Y – all new letters except A and T. T is in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (fixed).

""TAUNT"" – U is ruled out (from RATIO feedback: O(x) implies O not in word, but U wasn’t tested; actually U is separate). Wait, RATIO feedback only ruled out O, not U. So ""TAUNT"" is possible: T A U N T. But T is in position 5 here, which is allowed. However, double T might be less likely. 

Between ""TACKY"" and ""TAUNT"":

- ""TAUNT"": T, A, U, N, T – new letters U, N, but double T

""TACKY"" introduces more new consonants (C, K, Y) without duplication, so I’ll go with it.

But wait, let’s re-examine T position:
From SLATE: T not in 4.
From RATIO: T not in 3.

Thus possible patterns:

""B A N K T"" – not a word. ""C A N T Y"" – not a word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that is a valid 5-letter English word and contains common letters that are likely to appear in many words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Some good starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" - uses very common letters S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E
- ""RAISE"" - similar to above with S and E
- ""ADIEU"" - uses many vowels but fewer consonants

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has a good mix of common consonants and vowels, covering 5 of the most frequent letters in English.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback from SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all  
- L (x) – not in the word at all  
- A (-) – in the word, but not in the 3rd position  
- T (-) – in the word, but not in the 4th position  
- E (x) – not in the word at all  

Known so far:
- Contains A and T somewhere
- Does NOT contain S, L, E
- Positions 3 and 4 are open for A/T, but they are not fixed there
- Still need to test other common consonants and vowels

A good follow-up guess should:
1. Keep A and T in different positions
2. Avoid S, L, E
3. Introduce other common consonants (R, N, C, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, O, U)

Candidate word: RATIO
- R – common consonant, new letter
- A – still present, now in position 2
- T – still present, now in position 3
- I – new vowel
- O – new vowel

This gives us fresh letters while repositioning the known A and T.

<guess>RATIO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:
- Letters we know are in the word: A (fixed in position 2), T (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, E, R, I, O.

Pattern of the secret word:
- 1st letter: unknown, must be from remaining common consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.)
- 2nd letter: A
- 3rd letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters (cannot be T, because T is not in position 4, so we can test it here)
- 4th letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters (cannot be T)
- 5th letter: unknown, must be from remaining letters

We also know T must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback: T(-)), but it is not in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 (from RATIO). So possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is A, so T must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s test T in position 1:
- Word format: T A _ _ _

Remaining common consonants to test: C, M, N, K, etc. Let’s try ""TAC"" as a prefix and add two more consonants that haven’t been used yet. ""TAC"" is not a complete word, so let’s think of valid 5-letter words starting with TA and containing T somewhere.

But simpler: since T must be in position 1 or 5, and we haven’t seen it in position 1 yet, let’s try T in position 1.

Candidate word: TACHY – but not common.
Better common words: TANKS, TAMER, TAWNY, TABBY, etc. But we have constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- T must be in position 1 or 5 (from feedback).

Let’s try T in position 1: T A _ _ _

Now fill positions 3-5 with new common consonants not yet used. From unused: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants left: C, N, K, etc.

Let’s pick ""TAN"" as root and extend: T A N K _. Need a 5th letter. ""TANKS"" is valid, but S is already ruled out. ""TANKY"" – not a word. ""TANGO"" – O is ruled out. 

Next: T A M _ _. ""TAMER"" – E is ruled out. ""TAMMY"" – M and Y are okay, but double M might be less likely. 

Alternative: T A C _ _. ""TACET"" – E is ruled out. ""TACKY"" – Y is okay, K is new. ""TACKY"" is a valid word and uses new letters K and Y.

Another approach: T in position 5. Then word is _ A _ _ T. 

Let’s try ""C A _ _ T"". ""CABOT"" – B is okay. ""CANT"" is 4 letters. ""CAVET"" – not a word. 

""MAT"" as root: M A _ _ T. ""MATCH"" – C and H are new. ""MATCH"" fits: M, A, T, C, H. T is in position 4 here, but feedback says T is not in position 4 (from SLATE). So ""MATCH"" has T in 4, which is invalid. 

""N A _ _ T"": ""NASTY"" – S is ruled out. ""NATty"" – not 5 letters. 

""M A _ T _"": ""MAT"" plus two more. ""MATTE"" – E is ruled out. 

Best option seems ""TACKY"" with T in position 1.

But let’s verify letters used so far:
- Ruled out: S, L, E, R, I, O
- Known in word: A (pos 2), T (somewhere not 3 or 4)
- ""TACKY"": T, A, C, K, Y – all new letters except A and T. T is in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (fixed). 

Thus, ""TACKY"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""TANGO"" – but O is ruled out. 
""TAUNT"" – U is ruled out (from RATIO feedback: O(x) implies O not in word, but U wasn’t tested; actually U is separate). Wait, RATIO feedback only ruled out O, not U. So ""TAUNT"" is possible: T A U N T. But T is in position 5 here, which is allowed. However, double T might be less likely. 

Between ""TACKY"" and ""TAUNT"":
- ""TACKY"": T, A, C, K, Y – new letters C, K, Y
- ""TAUNT"": T, A, U, N, T – new letters U, N, but double T

""TACKY"" introduces more new consonants (C, K, Y) without duplication, so I’ll go with it.

But wait, let’s re-examine T position:
From SLATE: T not in 4.
From RATIO: T not in 3.
Thus T must be in 1, 2, or 5.
But position 2 is A, so T must be in 1 or 5.

Thus possible patterns:
1. T A _ _ _
2. _ A _ _ T

For pattern 1: T A _ _ _. Best candidate so far is TACKY.
For pattern 2: _ A _ _ T. Let’s see: 
- 1st letter: new consonant, e.g. C, M, N
- 3rd letter: new consonant
- 4th letter: new consonant
Example: C A B B T – invalid. C A N T O – O ruled out. C A R T S – R and S ruled out. 

""B A N K T"" – not a word. ""C A N T Y"" – not a word. 

Seems pattern 1 gives more valid options. Thus ""TACKY"" is best.

But let me think of another word:
""TA"" + new consonants + ""T"": e.g. T A P E T – not valid. 

Actually, ""TAWNY"" – W and N, Y. T in 1, A in 2, W N Y new. Valid word. 

Between TACKY and TAWNY:
- TACKY: C, K, Y
- TAWNY: W, N, Y

Both are good. ""TAWNY"" introduces W and N, which are also common. I’ll go with ""TAWNY"".

Final check:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (fixed)
- W, N, Y – all new letters
- No ruled-out letters used

   - T is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - N is in position 4 (✓)
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all: S, L, E, R, I, O, W, Y
4. We still need to determine positions 3 and 5.

Letters available (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z
- Vowels: none left (A is already used, E, I, O are ruled out)

Looking carefully, the only remaining consonants that can fit are C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

- TAQ_N_ – not a word
- TAV_N_ – not a word

Wait, position 3 and 5 can be any remaining consonants. Let me list possible combinations:

Possible pattern: T A _ N _

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe position 3 and 5 are the same consonant?

Possible words:
- TABB_N – not a word
- TACC_N – not a word
- TADD_N – not a word
- TAFF_N – not a word
- TAGG_N – not a word
- TAHH_N – not a word

- TAPP_N – not a word
- TAQQ_N – not a word
- TAVV_N – not a word
- TAXX_N – not a word
- TAZZ_N – not a word

This seems difficult. Let me re-examine the available consonants and see if any fit.

Looking at the pattern T A _ N _, with remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible valid words:
- TABUN – but U is vowel, allowed (but we thought only consonants left, but U is sometimes consonant)
- TACAN – but N is already in position 4
- TAKIN – I is ruled out
- TAMAN – second A is already in position 2
- TAPIR – I and R are ruled out
- TAPEN – E is ruled out
- TAXON – O is ruled out
- TAZZA – second A is already in position 2

None of these seem to fit. Let me look for words where position 3 or 5 could be U (since it's sometimes a consonant).

But U hasn't been ruled out yet. The only vowel used is A, and E, I, O are ruled out. So U is still possible.

Possible words:
- TABUN – T A B U N – B and U are new, but N is already in position 4
- TACAN – T A C A N – A is already in position 2
- TALUK – L is ruled out
- TAMUN – not a word
- TAUNT – T A U N T – U is new, T is already in position 1, but this would have T in position 1 and 5, which might be possible (double T)
- TAPIR – I and R are ruled out
- TAROK – R and O are ruled out
- TAXON – O is ruled out

Between these, ""TAUNT"" is a valid word with T at position 1 and 5, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4. But we have T already at position 1, and no restriction on double T. However, Wordle words usually don't have repeated letters unless necessary.

""TABUN"" is a valid word (a type of nerve gas), but it's obscure.

Alternative: ""TAJIN"" – but I is ruled out.

""TAZON"" – O is ruled out.

""TAHAN"" – H is new, but repetition of A is not needed.

""TAHAN"" – T A H A N – A is already in position 2, second A is not needed.

""TAGUN"" – not a word.

""TAFUN"" – not a word.

""TADUN"" – not a word.

""TAJUN"" – not a word.

""TAQUA"" – Q is new, but A is already in position 2.

This is proving tricky. The only remaining valid word seems to be ""TAUNT"", despite the double T. Let me check if any other consonants fit:

Possible consonants for position 3 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

- TAJ_N_ – no word
- TAK_N_ – no word
- TAM_N_ – no word
- TAP_N_ – no word
- TAQ_N_ – no word
- TAV_N_ – no word
- TAX_N_ – no word
- TAZ_N_ – no word

Thus, the only plausible candidate is ""TAUNT"", even with the double T.

But wait, let me consider position 5 could be any remaining consonant, and position 3 could be U:

Pattern: T A U N _
Letters left for position 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Possible words:
- T A U N B – not a word
- T A U N C – not a word
- T A U N D – not a word
- T A U N F – not a word
- T A U N G – not a word
- T A U N H – not a word
- T A U N J – not a word
- T A U N K – not a word
- T A U N M – not a word
- T A U N P – not a word
- T A U N Q – not a word
- T A U N V – not a word
- T A U N X – not a word
- T A U N Z – not a word

None of these are valid. Thus, the only remaining valid word seems to be ""TAUNT"", despite the double T.

However, looking back, the feedback from TAWNY was T(✓) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) Y(x), meaning:
- T is in position 1
- A is in position 2
- N is in position 4
- W and Y are not in the word

Thus, the word is T A _ N _ with remaining consonants for positions 3 and 5.

The only valid word fitting this seems to be ""TAUNT"" (T A U N T), even with T repeated. This might be the intended word.

But let me double-check if any other words fit:
- T A B N _ – none
- T A C N _ – none
- T A D N _ – none
- T A F N _ – none
- T A G N _ – none
- T A H N _ – none
- T A J N _ – none
- T A K N _ – none
- T A M N _ – none
- T A P N _ – none
- T A Q N _ – none
- T A V N _ – none
- T A X N _ – none
- T A Z N _ – none

Thus, ""TAUNT"" appears to be the only valid word left. However, this seems unlikely due to the double T. Let me reconsider position 3.

Perhaps position 3 is a consonant and position 5 is a consonant, but I missed a valid word.

Looking again:
- T A _ N _
Valid words:
- TACAN – but N is already in position 4
- TAKIN – I is ruled out
- TAMAN – second A is already in position 2
- TAPIR – I and R are ruled out
- TAROK – R and O are ruled out
- TAXON – O is ruled out
- TAZON – O is ruled out
- TABUN – this is a valid word: T A B U N – but U is not a consonant, and N is already in position 4

This is perplexing. It seems the only remaining valid word is ""TAUNT"", despite the double T. 

Given the constraints, ""TAUNT"" must be the word, even with the T repeated.

But let me check if I missed any consonants. The remaining consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- T A B N _ – no word
- T A C N _ – no word
- T A D N _ – no word
- T A F N _ – no word
- T A G N _ – no word
- T A H N _ – no word
- T A J N _ – no word
- T A K N _ – no word
- T A M N _ – no word
- T A P N _ – no word
- T A Q N _ – no word
- T A V N _ – no word
- T A X N _ – no word
- T A Z N _ – no word

Thus, the only possible word is ""TAUNT"".

But looking back, ""TAUNT"" is T A U N T, which fits:
- T in 1 (✓)
- A in 2 (✓)
- U is new (not ruled out yet)
- N in 4 (✓)
- T in 5 (allowed, even if repeated)

Therefore, the next guess must be ""TAUNT"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2  
- N is fixed in position 4
- Letters not in the word: S, L, E, R, I, O, W, Y
- T must appear again elsewhere, but positions 3 and 5 remain open

The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern T A _ N _ and uses only allowed letters is ""TAUNT"":

<guess>TAUNT</guess>",TAUNT,"Current constraints:
1. Word is 5 letters.
2. Letters we know are in and their positions:
   - T is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - N is in position 4 (✓)
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all: S, L, E, R, I, O, W, Y
4. We still need to determine positions 3 and 5.

Letters available (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z
- Vowels: none left (A is already used, E, I, O are ruled out)

So positions 3 and 5 must be filled with the remaining consonants.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching the pattern T A _ N _ where the blanks are from the available consonants.

Possible candidates:
- T A C N _ – but no valid word
- T A B N _ – none
- T A G N _ – none
- T A M N _ – none
- T A P N _ – none
- T A K N _ – none
- T A F N _ – none
- T A D N _ – none

Wait, position 5 must be consonant, position 3 must be consonant.

Looking carefully, the only remaining consonants that can fit are C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible candidates:
- TAC_N_ – none
- TAF_N_ – none
- TAG_N_ – none

- TAP_N_ – not a word
- TAQ_N_ – not a word
- TAV_N_ – not a word
- TAX_N_ – not a word
- TAZ_N_ – not a word

Wait, position 3 and 5 can be any remaining consonants. Let me list possible combinations:

Possible pattern: T A _ N _

Letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z

Valid words:
- TAC_N_ – none

- TAM_N_ – none
- TAP_N_ – none
- TAQ_N_ – none
- TAV_N_ – none
- TAX_N_ – none
- TAZ_N_ – none

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe position 3 and 5 are the same consonant?

Possible words:
- TABB_N – not a word
- TACC_N – not a word
- TADD_N – not a word
- TAFF_N – not a word
- TAGG_N – not a word
- TAHH_N – not a word
- TAJJ_N – not a word
- TAKK_N – not a word
- TAMM_N – not a word
- TAPP_N – not a word
- TAQQ_N – not a word
- TAVV_N – not a word
- TAXX_N – not a word
- TAZZ_N – not a word

This seems difficult. Let me re-examine the available consonants and see if any fit.

Looking at the pattern T A _ N _, with remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible valid words:
- TABUN – but U is vowel, allowed (but we thought only consonants left, but U is sometimes consonant)
- TACAN – but N is already in position 4
- TAKIN – I is ruled out
- TAMAN – second A is already in position 2
- TAPIR – I and R are ruled out
- TAPEN – E is ruled out
- TAXON – O is ruled out
- TAZZA – second A is already in position 2

None of these seem to fit. Let me look for words where position 3 or 5 could be U (since it's sometimes a consonant).

But U hasn't been ruled out yet. The only vowel used is A, and E, I, O are ruled out. So U is still possible.

Possible words:
- TABUN – T A B U N – B and U are new, but N is already in position 4
- TACAN – T A C A N – A is already in position 2
- TALUK – L is ruled out
- TAMUN – not a word
- TAUNT – T A U N T – U is new, T is already in position 1, but this would have T in position 1 and 5, which might be possible (double T)
- TAPIR – I and R are ruled out
- TAROK – R and O are ruled out
- TAXON – O is ruled out

Between these, ""TAUNT"" is a valid word with T at position 1 and 5, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4. But we have T already at position 1, and no restriction on double T. However, Wordle words usually don't have repeated letters unless necessary.

""TABUN"" is a valid word (a type of nerve gas), but it's obscure.

Alternative: ""TAJIN"" – but I is ruled out.

""TAZON"" – O is ruled out.

""TAHAN"" – H is new, but repetition of A is not needed.

""TAHAN"" – T A H A N – A is already in position 2, second A is not needed.

""TAGUN"" – not a word.

""TAFUN"" – not a word.

""TADUN"" – not a word.

""TAJUN"" – not a word.

""TAQUA"" – Q is new, but A is already in position 2.

This is proving tricky. The only remaining valid word seems to be ""TAUNT"", despite the double T. Let me check if any other consonants fit:

Possible consonants for position 3 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Looking for T A _ N _ words:
- TAC_N_ – none
- TAD_N_ – none
- TAF_N_ – none
- TAG_N_ – none
- TAH_N_ – TAH_N_ – no word
- TAJ_N_ – no word

- TAM_N_ – no word
- TAP_N_ – no word
- TAQ_N_ – no word
- TAV_N_ – no word
- TAX_N_ – no word
- TAZ_N_ – no word

Thus, the only plausible candidate is ""TAUNT"", even with the double T.

But wait, let me consider position 5 could be any remaining consonant, and position 3 could be U:

Pattern: T A U N _
Letters left for position 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Possible words:
- T A U N B – not a word

- T A U N P – not a word
- T A U N Q – not a word
- T A U N V – not a word
- T A U N X – not a word
- T A U N Z – not a word

None of these are valid. Thus, the only remaining valid word seems to be ""TAUNT"", despite the double T.
