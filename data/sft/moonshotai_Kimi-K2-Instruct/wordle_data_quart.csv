Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, my goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I want a word that covers as many of these as possible. A good starting word is one that uses common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- This combination is likely to hit at least one correct letter in many possible words

This will help me identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the first letter in the guess).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the second letter in the guess).
- O, S, E are all not in the word.

So the secret word contains A and R somewhere, but not in position 1 or 2 respectively, and it definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E. That leaves the letters A and R to be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in positions other than 1 and 2.
2. Does NOT use O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A possible word is ""TRAIN"" but this uses A in position 3 and R in position 2, but R can't be in position 2 (from the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong).

Another option is ""DRAIN"" but A is in position 3 and R in position 2 - same issue with R.

Let's try ""TRAIL"" - R is in position 2 (still wrong position), A in position 3 (possible), but we need to avoid R in position 2.

How about ""TRIAD"" - A in position 4, R in position 2 - R is still in position 2 which we know is wrong.

Let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""FRANK"" - uses A in position 3, R in position 2 - R is still in position 2.

""GRANT"" - A in position 4, R in position 2 - same issue.

""BRAIN"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same issue.

""TRAMP"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same.

""DRAFT"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same.

This suggests we need to move R to positions 3,4, or 5, and A to positions 2,3,4, or 5 (but not 1).

Let's try ""TRIAR"" - but this has R in position 4 and 5, which is fine for positions, but we need another letter.

Wait, we need a valid 5-letter word using A and R in allowed positions, avoiding O,S,E.

Let me think of words where A and R are in positions 3-5.

For example:
- CARD (but this is 4 letters)
- CARGO (but has O)
- MARCH (but has E)
- BARGE (but has E)
- CRAMP (no A or R)
- TRAM (4 letters)

Hmm, need to think differently. Let's try ""RATIO"" but has O and E is missing but O is excluded.

""RAFTY"" - has A in position 2, R in position 1. But A was in position 1 before and marked wrong position, so position 2 is okay for A, but R is in position 1 which wasn't tested yet.

But ""RAFTY"" uses F and T and Y, none of which are excluded.

Alternatively, ""TARDY"" - A in position 2, R in position 3. A was in position 1 before (wrong), so position 2 is new. R was in position 2 before (wrong), so position 3 is new. This uses T, D, Y which are all new letters not excluded.

This seems like a good candidate.

""TARDY"":

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the secret word (✓ or -):
A, R, T

Letters NOT in the secret word (x):
O, S, E, D, Y

Positions that are wrong for each known letter:
- A: positions 1 (AROSE) and 2 (TARDY) are wrong.
- R: positions 2 (AROSE) and 3 (TARDY) are wrong.
- T: position 1 (TARDY) is wrong.

So the secret word contains:
- A, R, T exactly once each.
- No O, S, E, D, Y.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- R must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).
- T must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since 1 is ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that uses A, R, T and two other letters that are not in the forbidden set {O,S,E,D,Y}.

Good remaining consonants: N, L, C, G, B, M, F, H, K, P, V, W, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

We need a word with letters drawn from {A,R,T} plus two others from the above list.

Let’s look for common words that use A, R, T.

Try CRATE – but E is forbidden.
TRAIT – uses T twice.

RATIO – O is forbidden.
ARTIC – uses C and I.
ARTIC has A, R, T, I, C; positions: A(1) R(2) T(3) I(4) C(5)
Check positions against rules:
- A is in position 1: in AROSE, A was in position 1 and marked wrong position → ARTIC has A in position 1 which is disallowed. So ARTIC is invalid.

Next try TRIAC – but T is in position 1 (forbidden).

How about ATTIC – T twice and A in position 1 (forbidden).

RATIN – uses N, but N is allowed; positions: R(1) A(2) T(3) I(4) N(5)
- A is in position 2: forbidden (from TARDY) → invalid.

TRIAD – D is forbidden.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,quart,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, my goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I want a word that covers as many of these as possible. A good starting word is one that uses common vowels and consonants without repeating letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- This combination is likely to hit at least one correct letter in many possible words

This will help me identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the first letter in the guess).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the second letter in the guess).
- O, S, E are all not in the word.

So the secret word contains A and R somewhere, but not in position 1 or 2 respectively, and it definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E. That leaves the letters A and R to be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in positions other than 1 and 2.
2. Does NOT use O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A possible word is ""TRAIN"" but this uses A in position 3 and R in position 2, but R can't be in position 2 (from the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong).

Another option is ""DRAIN"" but A is in position 3 and R in position 2 - same issue with R.

Let's try ""TRAIL"" - R is in position 2 (still wrong position), A in position 3 (possible), but we need to avoid R in position 2.

How about ""TRIAD"" - A in position 4, R in position 2 - R is still in position 2 which we know is wrong.

Let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""FRANK"" - uses A in position 3, R in position 2 - R is still in position 2.

""GRANT"" - A in position 4, R in position 2 - same issue.

""BRAIN"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same issue.

""TRAMP"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same.

""DRAFT"" - A in position 3, R in position 2 - same.

This suggests we need to move R to positions 3,4, or 5, and A to positions 2,3,4, or 5 (but not 1).

Let's try ""TRIAR"" - but this has R in position 4 and 5, which is fine for positions, but we need another letter.

Wait, we need a valid 5-letter word using A and R in allowed positions, avoiding O,S,E.

Let me think of words where A and R are in positions 3-5.

For example:
- CARD (but this is 4 letters)
- CARGO (but has O)
- MARCH (but has E)
- BARGE (but has E)
- CRAMP (no A or R)
- TRAM (4 letters)

Hmm, need to think differently. Let's try ""RATIO"" but has O and E is missing but O is excluded.

""RAFTY"" - has A in position 2, R in position 1. But A was in position 1 before and marked wrong position, so position 2 is okay for A, but R is in position 1 which wasn't tested yet.

But ""RAFTY"" uses F and T and Y, none of which are excluded.

Alternatively, ""TARDY"" - A in position 2, R in position 3. A was in position 1 before (wrong), so position 2 is new. R was in position 2 before (wrong), so position 3 is new. This uses T, D, Y which are all new letters not excluded.

This seems like a good candidate.

""TARDY"":
- T: new letter
- A: in position 2 (was in position 1 before, so allowed)
- R: in position 3 (was in position 2 before, so allowed)
- D: new letter
- Y: new letter

No excluded letters (O,S,E) are used.
