To make the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the amount of information gained. The best starting words often include a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's known to be a strong starting word, containing the vowels A and E, along with common consonants S, L, and T. This should help me identify several key letters early on.

From the feedback on SLATE we can lock in:

1. S is in the correct first position (✓).  
2. L is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  
3. E is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  
4. A and T are not in the word at all (x).

Target pattern so far: S _ _ _ _, with L and E somewhere in positions 2–5 (and neither in their original spots: L≠2, E≠5).

Next, I want to test a few things:
- Keep S fixed.
- Put L and E into new, non-conflicting positions.
- Include other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good candidates that satisfy these constraints: SLEEP, SLEET, SMELT, SPEEL, SPELT, SPEND, etc.  
Of these, “SLEEP” uses three new letters (P twice and the second E) while keeping S fixed, moving L to position 3 and E to position 4. This tests P and double-E in one go, giving maximal new information.

From the first two guesses we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. E is in the word and is **not** in position 4 (because in SLEEP the last E got “-”, not “✓”).  
3. L is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (it was “-” in both SLATE and SLEEP).  
   So L must be in position 4 or 5, and since E is already known to occupy one of the remaining spots, L can only be in 4 or 5, and E can only be in 2 or 3 or 5 (but not 4).  
4. A, T, P are out of the word entirely.

Current skeleton:  
S _ _ _ _
Allowed letters: L and E somewhere, plus any other letters not yet eliminated (common ones still in play are R, N, D, C, K, etc.).

A good next test uses the fixed S, places E and L in still-possible positions, and introduces new consonants.  
Putting E in position 3 and L in position 5 satisfies all constraints so far and gives us the word “SNELL”.  
But “SNELL” uses L twice, which doesn’t add new information.  
Instead, let’s try “SLEEK”:
- S(1) fixed  
- L(2) is **not** allowed (because L was “-” in position 2 in SLATE)  
  However, in “SLEEK” L would be in position 2, which we’ve already ruled out.  
So that’s invalid.  

Next candidate: “SELLS” – again duplicates L/S without new letters.  

Let’s choose “SNEER” instead:
- S(1) fixed  
- E appears in positions 2 and 5: one of them must be correct.  
- N and R are fresh letters.  
- L is not used, but we already know L must appear once, so this guess purposefully omits L to test whether the word might contain E twice and no L (contradicting earlier feedback).  
  That would be poor strategy.  

Better: we **must** include L **once** and E once, and place them only where allowed.  
Allowed placements:  
E can be in 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  
L can be in 4 or 5 (but not 1, 2, or 3).

Let’s combine these:
- If L is in 5, then E can be in 2 or 3.  
  Word shape: S E _ _ L or S _ E _ L.  
- If L is in 4, then E can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
  Word shape: S _ _ L E (but E in 5 is allowed, yet E cannot be in 4).  

The simplest valid word that satisfies all constraints and introduces new consonants is “SMELT”:
- S(1) fixed  
- M new consonant  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- L in 4 (allowed)  
- T already ruled out – so this is invalid.

“SHELL”:
- S(1) fixed  
- H new consonant  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- L in 4 (allowed)  
- L in 5 (allowed, only one extra L)  
This satisfies every rule.

Therefore:
