This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to choose a word that contains common English letters and is likely to help narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. A good first guess should ideally include some of these letters to maximize the information gained.

""AROSE"" is a frequently recommended starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants, and includes 4 of the 5 most common letters in English. This should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual word.

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A: in the word, wrong position (-)
- R: NOT in the word (x)
- O: NOT in the word (x)
- S: NOT in the word (x)
- E: in the word, wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The secret word contains at least one A and at least one E.
2. The secret word does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. Neither A nor E are in their original positions (1st and 5th).

Since A and E must be placed in new positions and we’ve eliminated R/O/S, we can try a word that:
- repositions A and E,
- introduces new common letters (T, L, N, etc.), and
- avoids R, O, S.

A good candidate is “TEALY”… but that’s not a word. A real word with the required constraints is “LEANT” or “LATEX” but both contain R/O/S or other disallowed letters. 

A valid choice is “LEANT” but it contains an N and T, neither of which are ruled out. However, “LEANT” is fine except we need a 5-letter word that uses A and E in new positions without R/O/S. 

“TEACH” is invalid (H is fine, but C and H weren’t ruled out). 

“LEANT” is valid but N and T are new. 

A better option is “EARTH” but R is ruled out. 

“PLATE” has P and L and T, and positions E in 5th spot which is disallowed. 

Let’s pick “PLANE”:
- Contains A and E in new positions (3rd and 5th, but 5th is original so bad). 

Ah, E cannot be 5th. 

“LEANT” positions E in 2nd and A in 3rd. This seems optimal: new letters L, N, T are allowed, and positions are fresh.

But we can do better: “LEANT” is valid and uses A and E in new spots while avoiding R/O/S.

Another candidate is “TEALY” but not a word. 

“LEANT” is a valid English 5-letter word.

But let’s try “LEANT”:

L is new, E is in 2nd (allowed), A is in 3rd (allowed), N is new, T is new.

This seems acceptable.

However, “LEANT” is actually 6 letters. Whoops. Need 5-letter words.

Next candidate: “LANES” contains S which is ruled out.

“LEANT” is invalid as 6 letters. 

“LEANE” is not a word.

“LEANT” is wrong length. 

“BEANT” is not a word.

“NEATH” is valid but H is new, E in 2nd, A in 3rd, N, T, H.

A better choice is “NEATH”.

But simpler: “TEPAL” is not common.

“LEANT” is 6 letters. 

“TEPAL” is obscure.

“LEANT” is wrong.

A valid 5-letter word without R/O/S and repositions A/E is “ELATE” but E is 5th which is original.

“LEANT” is 6 letters – mistake.

Correct 5-letter word with repositioned A and E and avoiding R/O/S: “LEAPT” has P and T, E in 2nd, A in 3rd. But P and T are allowed.

“LEAPT” is valid.

But P is new.

Another: “LEANT” is 6 letters – removing.

Real 5-letter word: “LEANT” doesn’t exist as 5-letter. 

“LEANT” is 6 letters. 

Correct candidate: “LEANS” contains S which is ruled out.

“NEATH” is valid 5-letter word: N, E (2nd), A (3rd), T, H. None of R/O/S.

This seems best.

But let’s double-check:

NEATH:
- N: new
- E: 2nd (allowed, original was 5th)
- A: 3rd (allowed, original was 1st)
- T: new
- H: new

No R/O/S.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - E must be in the exact position it appeared in NEATH, i.e. the **second** letter.
   - A must appear somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 3 (NEATH) or 1 (AROSE), so A can be in positions 2, 4 or 5.  
     – However, position 2 is already taken by E, so A must be in position 4 or 5.

2. Letters confirmed **not** in the word:
   - R, O, S (from AROSE)
   - N, T, H (from NEATH)

3. Remaining unknown positions:
   - First letter (cannot be A, R, O, S, N, T, H, E)
   - Third letter (cannot be R, O, S, N, T, H, A, E)
   - Fourth or fifth letter must be A (depending on placement)
   - Fifth letter (if A is fourth)

Allowed letters still available:
- Vowels left: I, U  (A and E are already placed / known)
- Common consonants left: L, D, G, B, C, M, P, F, Y, etc.

Putting it together:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _  (E in position 2)
- A must be 4th or 5th.
- Remaining positions must avoid all ruled-out letters.

Let’s try a word that:
- Has E in 2nd place
- Has A in 4th place
- Uses only allowed consonants

Candidate: “BEADY”  
- B, E, A, D, Y  
- B is allowed, E is 2nd, A is 4th, D and Y are allowed.  
- All ruled-out letters are avoided.

Check:
Positions: 1(B), 2(E), 3(D), 4(A), 5(Y)  
- E in 2nd: ✓  
- A in 4th: ✓  
- No R, O, S, N, T, H: ✓  
- Valid 5-letter word: ✓
