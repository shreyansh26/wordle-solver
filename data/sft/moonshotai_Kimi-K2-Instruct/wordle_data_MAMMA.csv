For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can provide maximum information about the letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. I'll choose a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. A commonly recommended starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains C, R, A, N, E - which are all relatively common letters that can give good information about the secret word.

Feedback recap:
C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
A(-) – A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

Known facts:
- A is present (but not in slot 3).
- C, R, N, E are all absent.
- We still need to test common vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed A somewhere else.
2. Introduce several new common letters that haven’t been tried.
A common “second-word” choice is “SLATE”, but it re-uses E and T (we don’t know T yet) and E is already ruled out.  
Another solid option is “AUDIO”: it tests A (in a new spot), plus U, D, I, O.  
But with A guaranteed present, “TAILS” is also strong (T, A, I, L, S).  

I’ll go with “SLAID” (S, L, A, I, D) because it places A in position 3 again (which we know is wrong, so this violates the constraint).  
Let me pick “AUDIO” instead: A in position 1, plus U, D, I, O.

Recap of what we now know:

So the only vowel left is Y (sometimes used), and we need to test common consonants we haven’t used yet: S, T, L, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
- contain A in a new position (2, 4, or 5),
- include several fresh consonants we haven’t tested,
- be a real 5-letter word.

A strong candidate that meets these rules is “STAMP”:
- S, T, M, P are all new letters.
- A appears in position 2 (new position for A).
- Word is real and valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. I'll choose a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. A commonly recommended starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains C, R, A, N, E - which are all relatively common letters that can give good information about the secret word.

Known facts:
- A is present (but not in slot 3).
- C, R, N, E are all absent.
- We still need to test common vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed A somewhere else.
2. Introduce several new common letters that haven’t been tried.
A common “second-word” choice is “SLATE”, but it re-uses E and T (we don’t know T yet) and E is already ruled out.  
Another solid option is “AUDIO”: it tests A (in a new spot), plus U, D, I, O.  
But with A guaranteed present, “TAILS” is also strong (T, A, I, L, S).  

I’ll go with “SLAID” (S, L, A, I, D) because it places A in position 3 again (which we know is wrong, so this violates the constraint).

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
Vowels: none left except Y  
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus A, but A must occupy one of positions 1, 2, or 5)

A sensible next step is to find a 5-letter word that:
- has M in position 4,
- has A in one of positions 1, 2, or 5,
- uses fresh consonants,
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Our candidate list must meet:
- 4th letter = M
- A appears exactly once, in slot 1, 2, or 5
- no banned letters

Possible words:
- HAMMY – but Y repeats, and second M is possible but we already have M placed once
- GAMMA – has G, A, M, but second M is allowed, and A is in position 2
- JAMMY – same issue with Y
- KAYAK – but K twice, and A appears twice
- HYMNAL – 6 letters
- HAMAL – not a common word
- BALMY – A in 2, L, B, Y
- FAMLY – not an english word
- GAMMY – G, A, M, M, Y – ok
- LAMBY – L, A, M, B, Y – ok
- LAMAS – but S already ruled out
- BALMY – B, A, L, M, Y – A is in position 2, M is 4, all letters free so far
- CALM? – C ruled out
- LAMMY – ok
- FAMMY – ok
- HAMAL – ok
- LAMBY – ok
- BALMY – ok

BALMY is common and fits all constraints:
- B, A, L, M, Y
- M at 4 (✓)
- A at 2 (new position)
- B, L, Y are fresh letters
- No banned letters used

- Letters ruled out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, T, P, B, L, Y  
- Letters confirmed:
  – M is in position 4 (✓)  
  – A is in position 2 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ A _ M _

Remaining positions: 1 and 3.  
Allowed letters must come from consonants not yet used: F, G, H, J, K, V, W, X, Z (plus possibly repeated letters, but none are indicated).

We need two consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 3, making a valid 5-letter word ending in “A _ M _”.

Possible combinations that form real words:

- F and K → FAKEM? No.  
- G and F → GAFEM? No.  
- H and G → HAGEM? No.  
- H and K → HAKEM? No.  
- V and G → VAGEM? No.  
- W and H → WAHAM? No.  
- V and H → VAH_M? No.

Real common words with pattern _ A _ M _:

- GAMUT – but U and T are ruled out  
- HAKIM – I is ruled out  
- VAPID – P and D ruled out  
- FAKIR – I and R ruled out  
- HAKIM – again I ruled out  
- DAMP – D and P ruled out  
- JAMMY – Y and second M not forbidden, but Y ruled out  
- GAMMA – second M allowed, G and A already used (only once each) but G is allowed, second A in position 5. G A M M A → has second A at position 5. No letters banned.

G A M M A fits:
– G (position 1) – not ruled out  
– A (position 2) – confirmed ✓  
– M (position 3) – allowed, since we only know one M is in position 4, but the word can have another M  
– M (position 4) – confirmed ✓  
– A (position 5) – allowed, since A is already confirmed and can repeat  

GAMMA is a valid English word and satisfies constraints.
