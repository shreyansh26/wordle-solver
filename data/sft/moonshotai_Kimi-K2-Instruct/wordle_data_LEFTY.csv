- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For a first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and gives broad coverage of the alphabet. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. 

A classic first guess like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" is often recommended, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" which includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should provide good coverage for narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but E is not in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses E in one of positions 1-4.
- Avoids the letters A, R, O, S.
- Includes other common consonants (T, N, L, D, etc.) and a second vowel (I, U).

A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in position 5 (but feedback says E is NOT in position 5), so this is invalid.
Another candidate is ""ELITE"":
- Uses E in position 1 (allowed), avoids A/R/O/S, includes L, I, T.
- Letters: E, L, I, T, E – but it has two E's, and we only know one E exists. Still, it's valid to guess words with repeated letters; the extra E will just get an ""x"" if there's only one E.

To minimize duplication and maximize new letters, I'll try “ELITE”.

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(-)  
   - A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. ELITE → E(-), L(-), I(x), T(✓), E(-)  
   - E is again in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (consistent with above).  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - I is NOT in the word.  
   - T is in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ T _  
- Position 4 = T.  
- Contains E (positions 2 or 4, but 4 is T ⇒ E must be in position 2).  
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, I.

Possible candidates:  
- E must be in position 2 → _ E _ T _  
- L must be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- Remaining letters must come from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus the forbidden ones.

A straightforward next guess is “LEFTY”:  
- L in 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), F in 3, T in 4 (fixed), Y in 5.  
- Letters are all new except E and T (already confirmed).  
- It satisfies all constraints so far.

Thus, I’ll guess “LEFTY”.
