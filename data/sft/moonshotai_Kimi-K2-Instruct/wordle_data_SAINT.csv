For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D.

A good strategy is to include as many of these common letters as possible in the first guess. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me coverage of 4 vowels and 2 of the most common consonants, which should provide good information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but NOT in position 1
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word at all
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word at all
- S(-) : S is in the word, but NOT in position 4
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word at all

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: A, S
- Letters in correct positions: none yet

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or E
3. Has A in positions 2-5 (since it can't be position 1)
4. Has S in positions 1-3 or 5 (since it can't be position 4)

Looking at common letters that remain: T, N, L, I, D, C, U, M, P, Y, H, etc.

I'll try to construct a word with these constraints. Some possibilities:
- MUST contain A and S
- CANNOT contain R, O, E
- Try common consonants like T, N, L, etc.

Looking at the S constraint (can't be position 4), and A constraint (can't be position 1), a word like ""STAIN"" comes to mind:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T (not used yet)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- I (not used yet)
- N (not used yet)

This seems like a good second guess as it introduces new common letters (T, I, N) while respecting the constraints.

But let me check ""STAIN"":
- Contains S and A (required)
- Doesn't contain R, O, E
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (allowed)

This gives us 3 new letters (T, I, N) to test while working around the known constraints.

Another option could be ""SNAIL"" (S in 1, A in 3), or ""STASH"" (but that repeats S which might not be optimal).

I'll go with ""STAIN"".

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round-1: AROSE
  A(-) → A exists, NOT in slot 1  
  R(x) → R not in word  
  O(x) → O not in word  
  S(-) → S exists, NOT in slot 4  
  E(x) → E not in word  

Round-2: STAIN
  S(✓) → S is in slot 1 (position 1)  
  T(-) → T exists, but wrong slot (and it’s not slot 2)  
  A(-) → A exists, but wrong slot (and it’s not slot 3)  
  I(-) → I exists, but wrong slot (and it’s not slot 4)  
  N(-) → N exists, but wrong slot (and it’s not slot 5)  

So we know:
- Fixed letters: S _ _ _ _   (first letter is S)
- Must contain: T, A, I, N (all of them appear, but none are in the positions we tried)
- Cannot contain: R, O, E
- Positions already eliminated:
  – A cannot be slot 1 (from R1) or slot 3 (from R2)  
  – S cannot be slot 4 (from R1), but we already fixed it in slot 1  
  – T cannot be slot 2 (from R2)  
  – I cannot be slot 4 (from R2)  
  – N cannot be slot 5 (from R2)

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, using the remaining letters T, A, I, N exactly once each, and respecting the positional restrictions above.

Candidate words (only permutations of S-T-A-I-N):
- SATIN – but A is in slot 2 (allowed, since A is only banned from 1 and 3)  
- STAIN – already played (and A, I, N were in wrong positions)  
- STIAN – not a valid English word  
- SINTA – not valid  
- SANTI – not valid  
- SITAN – not valid  
- SATNI – not valid  

The only valid English word left is SATIN.

Let me check the positional constraints for SATIN:
- S(1) – fixed ✓  
- A(2) – not banned for A (only 1 and 3 were banned)  
- T(3) – slot 3 is allowed for T (only slot 2 was banned)  
- I(4) – slot 4 is banned for I (from R2), so this would get ✗ for I(4)  
Oops, that violates the I restriction.

Wait, let me re-order:
We need a permutation of S,T,A,I,N with:
1. First letter must be S.
2. T cannot be in slot 2.
3. A cannot be in slot 1 or 3.
4. I cannot be in slot 4.
5. N cannot be in slot 5.

Valid permutations with S fixed first:

S _ _ _ _

Remaining letters: T, A, I, N

Possible positions:
2,3,4,5

We need to place T,A,I,N in slots 2-5 respecting the bans.

Let’s enumerate the 24 permutations and filter:

1. S T A I N – T in 2 (banned) ❌  
2. S T A N I – T in 2 ❌  
3. S T I A N – T in 2 ❌  
4. S T I N A – T in 2 ❌  
5. S T N A I – T in 2 ❌  
6. S T N I A – T in 2 ❌  

7. S A T I N – A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (banned) ❌  
8. S A T N I – A in 2, T in 3, N in 4 (allowed), I in 5 (allowed) ✅  
   SATNI – but SATNI isn’t a valid word  

9. S A I T N – A in 2, I in 3 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (banned) ❌  
10. S A I N T – A in 2, I in 3, N in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed) ✅  
    S A I N T → S A I N T = S A I N T → “SAINT” – valid English word  

Let me check SAINT against constraints:
- S(1) ✓  
- A(2) – allowed (only 1,3 banned)  
- I(3) – allowed (only 4 banned)  
- N(4) – allowed (only 5 banned)  
- T(5) – allowed (only 2 banned)  

So SAINT satisfies all known constraints.

Another candidate could be S A N I T (SANIT) but that’s not a word.

Thus the only valid candidate is SAINT.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- The remaining letters T, A, I, N must all appear (since each got a “-” in the second guess), but none are yet in their correct spots.
- Forbidden positions: T≠2, A≠1 and 3, I≠4, N≠5.

The only valid English permutation of S-T-A-I-N that satisfies these constraints is “SAINT”.

- STIAN – not a valid English word  
- SINTA – not valid  
- SANTI – not valid  
- SITAN – not valid  
- SATNI – not valid  

The only valid English word left is SATIN.

Let me check the positional constraints for SATIN:
- S(1) – fixed ✓  
- A(2) – not banned for A (only 1 and 3 were banned)  
- T(3) – slot 3 is allowed for T (only slot 2 was banned)  
- I(4) – slot 4 is banned for I (from R2), so this would get ✗ for I(4)  
Oops, that violates the I restriction.

Wait, let me re-order:
We need a permutation of S,T,A,I,N with:
1. First letter must be S.
2. T cannot be in slot 2.
3. A cannot be in slot 1 or 3.
4. I cannot be in slot 4.
5. N cannot be in slot 5.

Valid permutations with S fixed first:

S _ _ _ _

Remaining letters: T, A, I, N

Possible positions:
2,3,4,5

We need to place T,A,I,N in slots 2-5 respecting the bans.

Let’s enumerate the 24 permutations and filter:

1. S T A I N – T in 2 (banned) ❌  
2. S T A N I – T in 2 ❌  
3. S T I A N – T in 2 ❌  
4. S T I N A – T in 2 ❌  
5. S T N A I – T in 2 ❌  
6. S T N I A – T in 2 ❌  

7. S A T I N – A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (banned) ❌  
8. S A T N I – A in 2, T in 3, N in 4 (allowed), I in 5 (allowed) ✅  
   SATNI – but SATNI isn’t a valid word  

9. S A I T N – A in 2, I in 3 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (banned) ❌  
10. S A I N T – A in 2, I in 3, N in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed) ✅  
    S A I N T → S A I N T = S A I N T → “SAINT” – valid English word  

Let me check SAINT against constraints:
- S(1) ✓  
- A(2) – allowed (only 1,3 banned)  
- I(3) – allowed (only 4 banned)  
- N(4) – allowed (only 5 banned)  
- T(5) – allowed (only 2 banned)  

So SAINT satisfies all known constraints.

Another candidate could be S A N I T (SANIT) but that’s not a word.

Thus the only valid candidate is SAINT.Based on the feedback, we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- The remaining letters T, A, I, N must all appear (since each got a “-” in the second guess), but none are yet in their correct spots.
- Forbidden positions: T≠2, A≠1 and 3, I≠4, N≠5.

The only valid English permutation of S-T-A-I-N that satisfies these constraints is “SAINT”.",Guess 3: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
