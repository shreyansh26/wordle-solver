Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters in diverse positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words, and each letter is in a different position. This gives us the best chance of hitting some letters right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct spot (position 1).
- S is in the correct spot (position 4).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we now have:
- Pattern: A _ _ S _
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E

1. Starts with A
2. Has S in position 4
3. Does NOT contain R, O, or E anywhere
4. Uses only letters that could fill positions 2, 3, and 5

Let’s list possible consonants and vowels that remain:
Allowed vowels: I, U, Y (A is already used)
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Now brainstorm words matching A _ _ S _:
- ADUST – contains U (allowed), D (allowed), T (allowed). This fits all constraints.
- AVAST – but A is already in position 1 and VAST contains A again, which is fine, but ""AVAST"" might be less common.
- AGIST – contains G, I, S (but S is already fixed in pos 4, and I is allowed)

Among these, ""ADUST"" seems the most straightforward and common word that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- A ✓ (position 1)
- D (not forbidden)
- U (not forbidden)
- S ✓ (position 4)
- T (not forbidden)

Start testing possible combinations:

- ABIST – not a common word.
- ACIST – no.
- AFIST – no.
- AGIST – yes, “AGIST” means to pasture livestock for a fee.
- AHIST – no.
- ALIST – no, not a word.
- AMIST – no.
- ANIST – no.
- APAST – no.
- AVAST – nautical term but contains A twice (A is allowed to repeat if the word has it), but we already have A fixed in pos 1, so pos 2 could be V: A V _ S T → “AVAST” is a word (but means “stop” in nautical terms).

So “AVAST” and “AGIST” both fit.

Which is more common in everyday usage? “AVAST” is more word-like.

But let me check “AGIST” – it is an actual word, though less common. However in word games, “AGIST” is acceptable.

But to maximize commonality, let me also think of “ASSIST” – but that’s 6 letters.

Wait, only 5 letters.

Another possibility: “ALIST” – not valid.

“AVAST” is a valid word: A V A S T – but we have A already in pos 1 and A in pos 3 is allowed (no info against duplicate letters). But we have no info against A repeating.

But we have no feedback about A repeating. However, since we only have two letters left to determine (positions 2 and 3), and we’ve only eliminated D, U, R, O, E, we can try to pick a word that introduces new letters.

Looking again, the word must be A _ _ S T.

Common word: “AVAST” – yes, fits.

But let me check dictionary: another valid word is “ABAST” – no, not valid.

Another: “AMAST” – no.

“AGIST” is valid: A G I S T.

This introduces G and I, which are new and allowed.

So “AGIST” is a good next guess.

Let me verify:
- A ✓

Another possibility: “ALIST” – not valid.

“AVAST” is a valid word: A V A S T – but we have A already in pos 1 and A in pos 3 is allowed (no info against duplicate letters). But we have no info against A repeating.

But we have no feedback about A repeating. However, since we only have two letters left to determine (positions 2 and 3), and we’ve only eliminated D, U, R, O, E, we can try to pick a word that introduces new letters.

Looking again, the word must be A _ _ S T.

Common word: “AVAST” – yes, fits.

But let me check dictionary: another valid word is “ABAST” – no, not valid.

Another: “AMAST” – no.

“AGIST” is valid: A G I S T.

This introduces G and I, which are new and allowed.

So “AGIST” is a good next guess.

Let me verify:
- A ✓
- G (new, allowed)
- I (new, allowed)
- S ✓
- T ✓

No forbidden letters. It’s a real word.

Therefore: AGIST.

From the three guesses we now know:

Pattern: A _ _ S T
Fixed correct letters: A (pos 1), S (pos 4), T (pos 5).
Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, D, U, I.
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: G (from AGIST).

So G must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Remaining usable letters (excluding the forbidden set):  
B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus G.

We need a common 5-letter word fitting A ? ? S T with G in either 2nd or 3rd position.

Possible candidates:
- A G _ S T  
  – AGAST (archaic “aghast” variant)  
  – AGGST (not a word)

- A _ G S T  
  – A L G S T (no word)  
  – A N G S T → “ANGST” (common word)

“ANGST” satisfies all constraints:
- A(✓) N G S(✓) T(✓)  
- G is now in the correct position 3.  
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore “ANGST” should be the next guess.
