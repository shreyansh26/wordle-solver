For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of common letters to help determine what's in the secret word.

However, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better as it includes the very common 'S', 'L', 'T' along with 'A' and 'E'. Between these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong opening word that tests several high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and E are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A and T are in the word but not in their current positions (-).

So we know:
1. Word has form: _ L _ _ _
2. It contains A and T (but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively)
3. It does NOT contain S or E

Good next step is to test more consonants while keeping the known L in position 2 and trying A and T in new positions. ""PLANT"" is a good candidate as it keeps L in place, tests new positions for A and T, and includes P and N. Let me try ""PLANT"".

From the new feedback on PLANT:
- P and N are NOT in the word (x).
- L stays ✓ in position 2.
- A is still in the word but not in positions 3 (from PLANT) or 3 (from SLATE) → must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- T is still in the word but not in positions 4 (from SLATE) or 5 (from PLANT) → must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

So far we know:
1. Word shape: _ L _ _ _
2. Contains: A, T, L
3. Does NOT contain: S, E, P, N
4. Possible positions:
   - A: 1, 4, 5
   - T: 1, 3, 4
   - L is locked in 2

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- Second letter is L
- Contains both A and T
- A and T are in allowed positions (A: 1/4/5, T: 1/3/4)
- No banned letters (S, E, P, N)

Some possibilities:
- CLAPT: T in position 4 (allowed), A in 3 (not allowed) → invalid
- FLAT_: T in 4, A in 3 → A invalid
- ALLOT: T in 5 (invalid)
- CLART: T in 5 (invalid)
- GLANT: N invalid
- ULTRA: T in 4 (valid), A in 5 (valid), no banned letters → perfect!

Let’s check ULTRA:
- _ L _ _ _ ✓
- Contains A (5), T (4) ✓
- No banned letters ✓
- T in 4 is valid, A in 5 is valid ✓
