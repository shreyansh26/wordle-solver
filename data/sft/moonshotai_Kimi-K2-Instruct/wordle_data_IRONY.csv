- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is the first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work from. The optimal strategy at this point is to choose a word that will give the most useful information for future guesses. This means selecting a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters.

Looking at common English letters and vowels, a good first guess often includes letters like A, E, S, T, R, etc. The word ""RAISE"" is considered one of the best first guesses because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (another very common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of getting hits on letters or their positions, and even if none are correct, it eliminates many possibilities since these are common letters.

We already know:
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (from feedback R(-)).
- I is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (from feedback I(-)).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and I (each at least once).
2. Does NOT use A, S, E.
3. Puts R somewhere other than position 1.
4. Puts I somewhere other than position 3.

Some candidate letters to fill the blanks: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, etc.

One solid word that satisfies these constraints is “TRICK”:
- T, C, K are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, because position 1 is forbidden for R).
- I is in position 3 → but wait, feedback already forbids I in position 3. So “TRICK” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FRUIT”
- F and U are new.
- R is in position 2.
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- T is new.
- Fits all constraints.

- I is in the word but **not** in position 4.

Letters still allowed: every letter except A S E F U T  
Letters we must use: R (already fixed at pos 2) and I (somewhere else, not pos 4).

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is R and which contains I somewhere else, and uses only allowed letters.

Let me list possible consonants/vowels left:
Consonants: B C D G H J K L M N O P Q V W X Y Z  
Vowels: I (already known), plus O (since A E U are out).

A promising word pattern: ? R ? ? ?

We need to place I in position 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be pos 4).
