- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains commonly used letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include some of these letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""ARISE"" because it contains five common letters (A, R, I, S, E) spread across different positions and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives a high chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ARISE we know:
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in 1st, 3rd, 4th or 5th).
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R fixed in position 2: _ R _ _ _
- I somewhere except position 3
- No A, S, E
- Still try to include other frequent consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: N, T, L, C, O, U, D, etc.

A balanced next guess is “ORBIT”:
- R is in the 2nd slot ✓
- I is in the 4th slot (allowed by the feedback) ✓
- Uses common letters B, T, O to gather more clues.
- Avoids A, S, E entirely.

We now have:

1. **R** is locked in the 2nd position.
2. **I** is in the word but NOT in 3rd or 4th positions (from Guess 2 feedback).  
   Therefore **I** must be in position 1 or 5.
3. **B** is in the word but not in 3rd position (from Guess 2 feedback).  
   So **B** must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. Letters **A, S, E, O, T** are ruled out entirely.

Goal: combine the remaining allowed letters and positions.

Possible slot assignments so far:

- Position 1: could be I or B (since I is allowed here and B hasn’t been tried here yet).
- Position 3: must be a consonant that hasn’t appeared and isn’t S, T, B (because B is only “in word” not confirmed position). Good choices: N, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.
- Position 4: must be a consonant (since all vowels tried so far are ruled out). Could also be B if B hasn’t been placed yet.
- Position 5: could be I if we place it here, or any other consonant.

A good word that fits these constraints and re-uses known letters efficiently is **BRICK**:
- R in position 2 (known).
- I in position 5 (allowed), giving us a new placement for I.
- B in position 1 (allowed, not yet placed).
- C and K are fresh consonants to test.
