1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

This is the first guess, so we have no information about the secret word. A good first guess is one that uses common letters and can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. The five most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T. 

I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters to maximize information gain. A strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good feedback about which of these popular letters are present in the word and their possible positions.

From the first guess we know:  
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
- A and S are not in the word at all.  

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _  
and the letters we still need to place are O and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 or 5.  

A good word to test next is one that keeps R in place, adds O and E in new spots, and introduces other common unused consonants. ""DROPE"" uses the known letters R, O, E and adds D and P. However, let me try ""DROVE"" to also test V since it's common and would help narrow things down further.  

Wait, actually ""DROVE"" would put O in the 3rd spot, which we know is wrong. Let me pick ""PROVE"" instead - it places O in the 4th spot (a new position) and E in the 5th spot (also a new position), while testing P and V.

So far we know:

- Pattern: _ R O _ _   (R and O are fixed in positions 2 and 3)
- E is definitely in the word, but not in position 5 (from both guesses).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4.

Thus the word is one of these two skeletons:
1. E R O _ _
2. _ R O _ E   (but position 5 is already excluded for E, so this can't be)

So it must be: E R O _ _

We need to fill the last two letters with letters **not yet ruled out** (no A, S, P, V).  
Common consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, H, etc.

Let’s try “ERODE”: it uses common letters and the only new letter is D.
